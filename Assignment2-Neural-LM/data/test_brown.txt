feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism. 
But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined 
by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment. In such a case 
the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied 
to the issue by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism 
only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the 
Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout at Eichmann though he might, 
the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying 
the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally 
recognized category of anti-Semitism. Yes, he believed that the 
Jews were "enemies of the Reich", and such a belief is, of course, 
typical of "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the 
Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member 
of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The real question was 
how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer 
to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In 
regard to Eichmann, 
it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained 
a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a 
principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent. 
Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could, 
as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the 
Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear of disobeying orders, 
as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness 
that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained 
in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's 
victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical 
rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous 
the better, "Well, let's try it". At any rate, the substance 
of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from 
his membership in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor 
did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success 
on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to 
that extent. ##
BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special 
Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened 
to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary 
anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany 
and wherever else they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial 
in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis 
to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the 
activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified 
by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites 
in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary? 
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 
1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death 
the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was 
attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including 
the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in 
charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the 
Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The measures for annihilation 
proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation, 
civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening the Conference, 
followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order 
issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as 
" a complement to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews 
from German living space through violence, economic strangulation, 
forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words, the promulgators 
of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews 
was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating 
in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on 
the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as 
a readiness for murder. This, in fact, it turned out to be. Since 
the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had 
began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions, 
and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their 
tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes; whether 
in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn 
the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the 
exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp 
brute? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism 
of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning 
of the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had 
conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent" dislike of Jews, 
as do others like them today. The Final Solution proved that the 
Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the 
criminality and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial have 
made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how 
representative types of "mere" anti-Semites were drawn step by 
step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor 
in his opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism" 
among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed". But 
if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's 
head 
at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press 
seems to have missed it. ##
NOR DID THE Trial devote much 
attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis, 
both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations 
and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the 
world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous 
weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew 
can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society 
into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know 
enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in 
the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting 
apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest 
impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally 
forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them 
partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial 
a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful 
of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform; 
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of 
politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent 
to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania 
and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you 
desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this 
characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor, 
more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a 
political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission 
of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed 
to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which 
the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&, 
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it 
met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, 
France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an 
outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism 
proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose 
citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't 
this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries 
worth highlighting? 
##
AS THE FIRST collective confrontation 
of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery 
of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen 
years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one 
believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance 
of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to 
recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to 
the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were 
unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had 
been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and 
investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors' 
accounts. 
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital 
presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the 
Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff. 
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of 
protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace 
of the community 
was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the 
incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's 
Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide 
a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated 
a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman 
Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board 
of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year 
later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an 
orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood 
Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were 
embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's 
right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents, 
typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no 
controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension, 
rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control 
issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of 
newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in 
municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted 
on the national level in the matter of including birth-control 
information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where 
it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment 
like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The 
time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove 
this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life 
of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment 
of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication 
on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination, 
loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study 
of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more 
serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is 
reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara, 
managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over 
Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the 
reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their 
jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed 
in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly 
harsh.
The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement- 
frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting- 
already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the 
over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being 
obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number 
of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible> 
parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents 
will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope 
Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from 
the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the 
whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as 
those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and 
social "indications". This means that such factors as the health 
of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their 
children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density 
of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately 
be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.
These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics 
in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control 
only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however, 
sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics, 
Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of 
family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman 
Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also 
known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers 
this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author: 
It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent 
and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman 
Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no 
moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives, 
allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in 
theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The 
grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament), 
the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the 
unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest 
ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent 
role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive, 
entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of 
birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition 
regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of 
the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual 
love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion 
is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason 
can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known 
His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus, 
man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal 
act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man 
may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by 
God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for 
the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this 
law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are 
obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let 
it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between 
Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But 
people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without 
taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it 
so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has 
sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation 
and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical 
consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation 
for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant 
one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint 
upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed 
to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during 
World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the 
Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe 
that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically 
evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants 
forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general 
public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that 
the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt 
to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, 
hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled 
in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an 
inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience 
shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced 
when it has little correspondence with the general view of society. 
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control 
today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned 
by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary 
to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian 
countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches 
stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth 
Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual 
change that has taken place among Protestants generally. 
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception 
and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural 
means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers- 
physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against 
the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing 
the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference 
declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded 
as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the 
primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance 
of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is 
the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful 
self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against 
the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth 
Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be 
the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances, 
contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958, 
the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by 
God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations 
preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out 
of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified 
artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity", 
the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the 
size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control 
of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement 
also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression 
of mutual affection <without> relation to procreation is right".
Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate 
pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared 
it at times to be a <religious duty>. What determines the morality, 
they state, is not the <means> used, but the <motive>. In 
general, the means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective are 
considered the most ethical.   This development is reflected in 
the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the 
National 
Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the 
~US. The board approved and commended the use of birth-control 
devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning. It 
called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting 
the information or availability of contraceptives.   The general 
board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception 
and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are 
right **h. The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather 
than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are 
limited to the prevention of conception".   An action once universally 
condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil 
law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant 
denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive 
<religious duty>. This viewpoint has now been translated into 
action by the majority of people in this country. Repeated polls have 
disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the 
practice of birth control.   For all concerned with social-welfare 
legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary 
change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American 
people is clear, profound and far-reaching. To try to oppose the general 
religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative 
fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was 
occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.   This brings 
us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in 
the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion: 
They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief. 
Conscience and religion are concerned with private <sin:> The civil 
law is concerned with public <crimes>. Only confusion, failure 
and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority 
the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the 
possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived 
imposition would be religion itself. 
##
On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, <Discovery>, 
weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool, London, and 
floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain, 
a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration 
of the Arctic waters of North America.   Seventeen months later, 
on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the <Discovery> 
limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port, 
she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The 
captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded 
her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.   What disaster 
struck the <Discovery> during those seventeen months? What happened 
to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained 
one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the 
evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal, 
(2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note 
found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand 
reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture.   But 
since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal 
files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not 
enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate 
picture of the events of the voyage.   Historians have had 
two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First, 
they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed 
it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose 
name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, 
on a great American river, and on half a million square miles 
of Arctic seas.   The name: <Henry Hudson>.   This 
is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or 
ever, probably, will be able- to determine:   The sailing in 
the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time 
his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western 
Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy 
Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole 
or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy 
Company indicated it would not back him again.   In 1609, the 
Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, 
fitted him out with a ship called the <Half Moon>, and supplied 
him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the 
middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important- 
the Great North (later, the Hudson) River- but it produced 
no northwest passage. ##
When the <Half Moon> put in at 
Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings 
leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government 
forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went 
to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime, 
he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage 
of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran 
ship called the <Discovery> and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, 
the largest he had ever commanded.   The purpose of this 
fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that 
a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe 
and 
the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a 
passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's 
sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.
But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to 
the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had 
noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the 
water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He 
named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious 
Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)
In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little <Discovery> that 
Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his 
frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all 
the 
way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.
Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he 
was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous, 
ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely 
such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain. 
On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of 
Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that 
he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case. On 
the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch 
and English crew members on the <Half Moon> had almost forced him 
to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.   Worse, 
his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before. Of 
only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son. The 
mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the <half Moon>, 
was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or 
desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was 
a good worker, but perversely independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael 
Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson 
in a crisis.   But men willing to sail at all into waters where 
wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find. Hudson 
knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer. And 
he refused to be anything else.   It is believed that Hudson 
was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was 
trained 
on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with three sons. 
(The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name 
was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.) In 1610, 
Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn 
voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession. 
##
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a 
few miles down the Thames. There at the river's edge waited one Henry 
Greene, whom Hudson listed as a "clerk". Greene was in actuality 
a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in 
order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores. 
He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board 
and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the <Discovery> picked 
him up.   For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the 
east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward. On May 11, she 
reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the 
crew called "Lousie Bay". The subsequent two-weeks wait made the 
crew quarrelsome. With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked 
a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue was 
settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined 
to catch the next fishing boat back to England. With difficulty, 
Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland. 
##
Early in June, the <Discovery> passed "Desolation" 
(southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall". 
Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog hung 
over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet. 
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic 
North Pole.   As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was 
forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the 
great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he 
turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the 
crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.   The trouble 
was at least partly Juet's doing. For weeks he had been saying that 
Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd. The great, 
crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice 
of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would 
sail no farther.   Instead of quelling the dissension, as many 
captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's 
head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable. 
He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which 
he set up in view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew 
about their course and their objectives.   When Hudson had finished, 
the "town meeting" broke down into a general, wordy 
argument. 
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety 
of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who 
said he wouldn't give <ten> pounds to be home. The statement was 
effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson was free to sail on. ## 
All through July the <Discovery> picked her way along the 450-mile-long 
strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands. On August 3, two massive 
headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before, 
so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape 
a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands 
of screaming sea birds. To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind 
to a precipice of 2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and 
Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.   Hudson pointed the <Discovery> 
down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called 
Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the 
Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered 
an area of shallow marshes and river deltas. The ship halted. The 
great "sea to the westwards" was a dead end.   This must have 
been Hudson's blackest discovery. For he seemed to sense at once 
that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North 
American continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to 
know he was destined to failure.   Feverishly, he tried to brush 
away this intuition. North and south, east and west, back and forth 
he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land 
appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after 
week. Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England 
through the "Furious Overfall" was again filling with ice.
The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking. 
Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest. Hudson's reply 
was to accuse the mate of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove 
his charges in an open trial.   The trial was held September 
10. Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony 
from crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men 
stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe 
swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords 
in their cabins. Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted 
bloodshed on the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the 
ship homeward.   Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new 
mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There were other 
shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves. 
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis 
Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.
As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little 
bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him. Once, 
after the <Discovery> lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered 
the anchor raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being 
hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and Adame Moore 
were thrown off the capstan and badly injured. The anchor cable would 
have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever 
it with his axe.
Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian 
Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands, 
conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River 
of the North. Since the land he desired lay within the great northern 
empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of 
the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies. Having 
achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the 
valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched 
southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red- was 
made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots 
was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus 
at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify 
the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle 
of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the 
center of the North American continent to the west of the American 
agricultural frontier.   Seven hundred miles south of York Factory, 
at "the Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three 
men located a settlement in August 1812. By October the little 
colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg) numbered 100. Within 
a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring 
the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called <Meurons>. 
The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported 
by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the 
War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of 
the war in 1815. Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go 
to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect 
his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the 
intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries 
were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of 
the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 
1818.   It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages 
of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement 
southward. When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was 
assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and <metis> moved up 
the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built huts and 
a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland. 
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer 
to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for 
food.   The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move 
southward by British fur traders. For many years the Northwest Company 
had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi 
River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul, 
Minnesota. When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm 
out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American 
citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly- 
continued in the fur business. On Big Stone Lake near the 
headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of 
the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned 
in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small 
artillery pieces. His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks 
of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south 
in carts. These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days 
of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk 
colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new carts" as 
being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as 
a horse could pack. They were held together by pegs and withes and 
in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.   It was Dickson 
who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast 
by way of the United States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina) 
Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux, 
he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the trip Selkirk decided 
that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern 
United States was the best route for goods from England to reach 
Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply 
for many goods than either Canada or England. Upon arriving at 
Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams, 
Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade 
with "Missouri and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he 
declared prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at first, 
would increase with the progress of our Settlements **h". 
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop 
into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might 
have expected. In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the 
Forks" (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort 
Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien. 
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three 
months of labor on Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice 
gone from the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river) 
their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels 
of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats 
and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse, 
and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820. This 
epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk @1,040. 
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were 
forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became 
more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony 
on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send 
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 
300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien, until then the most advanced 
United States post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry 
arrived at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of navigation 
on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St& 
Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander, 
Colonel Josiah Snelling.   It was from the American outposts 
that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules 
L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted 
to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and 
Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers. Bailly, 
after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave 
some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake 
Traverse "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the 
Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the 
fall. He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families 
of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward 
the United States. Observing their distressing condition, Colonel 
Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military 
reservation.   As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk 
settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman 
of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du Chien was traveling 
to Red River to open a trade in merchandise. Early in 1822 he was 
at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco. 
Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird, 
a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such "sundry 
articles" to a value of @4,500.   For its part the Hudson's 
Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement. 
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier 
by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the 
Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer- was on American 
territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move 
north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating 
the timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything", 
he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment 
**h". Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut 
off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350 
persons stayed in the village. They would attempt to bring supplies 
from St& Louis or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well 
as danger".   At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided 
to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families 
paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling. The disasters of 1825-1826 
caused more to leave. After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, 
snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through 
a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick. In April 
came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until 
mid-June. On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month 
trip across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443 survivors 
of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but 
most of them were sent on to Galena and St& Louis, with a few going 
as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United 
States. In 1837, 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were 
living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.   Below the fort, 
high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi 
River. At the point where they ended, another settlement grew 
up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier 
in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American 
Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were 
joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major 
Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840. 
The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father 
Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become an important center 
of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers 
who remained at Red River.   While population at Fort 
Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic 
opportunities did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though 
the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter 
which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the 
Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade. The Company 
maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased 
and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they 
refrain from trading in furs. Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some 
of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs. 
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed 
a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed 
as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power". 
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's 
local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding 
any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source 
of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men 
to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried 
pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St& 
Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells, 
transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This 
trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, 
but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty 
was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.
The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow 
in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel. 
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer 
humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in 
the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some 
of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate 
observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen 
and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were 
"in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house". 
A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One 
wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse + 
snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses 
in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times". 
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved 
about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches 
on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity 
of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and 
sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following 
description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse 
girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h 
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from 
the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression. 
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become 
of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my 
love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell, 
an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved 
in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked 
to 
tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about 
a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive 
letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married 
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar 
as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as 
I am 
so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote: 
"I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another 
Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down 
to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite 
before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"". 
Charles 
Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his 
comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation, 
well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like 
his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his 
service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups, 
name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and 
then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and 
'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file 
of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and 
wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most 
common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities 
referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but 
a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier 
stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough 
as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs 
from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer 
to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering 
from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier 
gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence 
of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three 
days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack 
and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother: 
"I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear 
and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters 
which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances. 
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers 
rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of 
the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of 
bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of 
the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many 
Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing 
from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the 
sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously 
written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing 
about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, 
stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced 
writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we 
take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed 
his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often 
**h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just 
count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every 
time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta 
reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they 
will knock over my ink, so I will close". #/3,#
The most 
common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But 
fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and 
these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing 
of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include 
in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro 
community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the 
war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro 
"body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging, 
cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes. 
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters 
of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members 
of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on 
correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages 
characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were 
stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally 
gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about 
their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or 
Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier 
whose 
feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully 
of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout 
I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it 
all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five 
of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I 
recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they 
would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk". 
Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who, 
from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment 
on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself 
thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was 
a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having 
any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse **h. 
I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf 
dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed card playing Sun 
of a bich com to Sea you, the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode 
helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as 
i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from 
soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions. 
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his 
first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting 
yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they 
brok + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches 
and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit 
Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers 
in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi 
soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain, 
stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry 
is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation 
of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to 
tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H& 
Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees 
from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a 
private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton 
and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head 
cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps 
**h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow 
their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point 
graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments 
about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers. 
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War 
version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves 
as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks 
**h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten 
cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George 
Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My 
own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended 
long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I 
wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging 
them against [the other half]".   No group of officers 
came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal 
soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde 
with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after 
the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank 
wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital 
for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed- 
thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union 
quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward 
each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut 
of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to 
a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey 
+ gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier 
wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw 
they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h". 
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote 
in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right 
**h found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe 
their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise 
with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would 
be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing 
from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama 
Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that 
my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid 
at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of 
cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty **h. 
THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION 
to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism 
in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence 
across the world. Thus, if we are to observe American folklore 
in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships 
between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism 
and international influence. 1) Every age rewrites the events 
of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends 
about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary 
actions. What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important 
as what a given generation feels must have occurred. 2) As a country 
superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches 
its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness. Its folklore 
and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account 
for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to 
become a cohesive force for national identification.   One can apply 
these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be 
applied again to the United States in more recent years. The popularity 
of local color literature before the Spanish-American War, the 
steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the 
frontier west in our mass media are cases in point. Nor is it an accident 
that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years, 
has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such 
as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical 
Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature, 
American civilization, American anything have swept our school 
and college curricula.   Of course, nationalism has really 
outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its 
continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the 
twentieth-century 
United States. Yet nationalism has lost few of its 
charms for the historian, writer or man in the street. It is an understandable 
paradox that most American history and most American literature 
is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic 
point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion 
over palm and pine. After all, the average American as he lies and 
waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain 
hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or 
her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental 
actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control. 
Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether 
warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense 
emotional involvement. Such identification comes for each group in each 
crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate 
national heroes.   In America, such self-deception has served 
a particularly useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed it 
to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and 
ever-changing 
land. But we must never forget, most of the appropriate 
heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs, 
almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson Weems's George 
Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of 
the uniting States. Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of 
the national Constitution. Robert E& Lee represented the dignity 
needed by a rebelling confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by 
those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett, 
Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.   Therefore, the 
scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years, 
will be mindful of two facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created 
to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are 
not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that an "American national 
folklore" exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.
Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group 
of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission. It 
has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions, 
rhymes and such literary forms of expression. Related to 
written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written 
form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral 
existence. Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies, 
it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our 
folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as 
this. Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus 
materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor 
union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition. Nor 
have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of 
isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did 
not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education 
and industrialization 
had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as 
a means of carrying culturally significant material.   Naturally, 
such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make 
money or fan patriotism by means of folklore. That much of what he 
calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people 
with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction 
to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant. As long 
as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses 
and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains satisfied.
From all this we can now see that two streams of development 
run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore. On 
the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained 
in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected 
and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic, 
regional and occupational groups that make up this nation. On the other 
we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been 
willing to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial material 
willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists (writers, movie 
producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore 
since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams 
even in the most general of ways. After all, the field is large, difficult 
to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates. 
In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many 
heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of 
print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society. 
The problems confuse even the experts.   For that matter, 
the experts themselves are a mixed breed. Anthropologists, housewives, 
historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline 
as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination 
of the four. They have widely varying backgrounds and aims. 
They have little "esprit de corps".   The outlook for the 
amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local 
history or for the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism 
in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote. 
Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain 
as such. The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is 
actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field. The collector 
enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the 
very "field and stream" reasons that many persons hunt game; and 
only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has 
located. Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector, 
are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between 
real folklore and bogus material.   But there are also the commercial 
propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other 
by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are primarily concerned 
with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector 
has found. Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond 
the sewage system and the electric light lines. The commercial propagandist, 
who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the 
amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's 
toes by refusing to keep his material genuine. His standards are, 
of course, completely foreign to those of the analyst. To both the amateur 
and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation 
with his endless probings and classifications. Dominated by 
the vicious circle of the university promotion system, the analyst looks 
down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups, although 
he cannot deny his debt to the collector.   The knowledge that 
most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial 
propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors. The work 
done by the analysts, the men who really know what folklore is all about, 
has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort 
and reaches a limited, learned audience. Publishers want books that 
will sell, recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to 
ears used to hillbilly and jazz music, grade and high schools want quaint, 
but moral, material. The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit 
in. As a result, most people don't have more than a vague idea what 
folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming, moral 
legends and patriotic anecdotes, with a superstition or remedy thrown 
in here and there. And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur 
and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the 
hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment 
and nationalism alone.   If one wishes to discuss a literary 
figure who uses folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize 
is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American 
public. And while every writer must be dealt with as a special 
case, the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions 
about each. Does the writer know the difference between an "ersatz" 
ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk? When 
the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial 
effect or does he leave it pure? Is the writer propagandistic? 
Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was? 
Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American 
attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they 
may be?   When he gets the answers to his questions he will be 
discouraged. In the first place, a good many writers who are said to 
use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional superstition or 
tale. Robert Frost, for instance, writes about rural life in New England, 
but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in 
his poems. This has not, however, prevented publishers from labeling 
him a "folk poet", simply because he is a rural one. In the second 
place, a large number of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost 
to being "folk writers" of one sort or another, clearly make 
no distinctions between genuine and bogus material. Stephen Vincent 
Benet's <John Brown's Body> comes immediately to mind in this 
connection, as does John Steinbeck's <The Grapes of Wrath> 
and Carl Sandburg's <The People, Yes>. The last two writers 
introduce strong political bias into their works, and not unlike the union 
leaders that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir of 
protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass. Folklore, as 
used by such writers, really reflects images engraved into it by the very 
person using it. The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect 
to nation or political attitude. In fact, there is much evidence to 
indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular 
regional, ethnic and occupational limits. Nevertheless, with a reading 
public that longs for the "good old days" and with an awareness 
of our expanding international interests, it is easy for the Benets 
to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of 
Americana, real or fake, and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs 
to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform 
into the minds of the folk. 
As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the spirit of peace 
and good will, and in exchange for armed support in the April election 
campaign, bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne 
Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade. The coalition 
was to prove inadvisable.   O'Banion was a complex and frightening 
man, whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour 
into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a 
jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets 
into someone's body. He carried three guns- one in the right 
trouser pocket, one under his left armpit, one in the left outside coat 
pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands. He killed accurately, 
freely, and dispassionately. The police credited him with twenty-five 
murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them. 
Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He was an expert 
florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths. 
He had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity 
into "right guys" and "wrong guys", and the wrong ones he 
was always willing to kill and trample under. He had what was described 
by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality". He walked with a heavy 
list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other, 
but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns. Landesco 
thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly" but he was, 
in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference 
to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also 
at this time, although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets 
as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and most dangerous mob 
leader in the Chicago underworld, the roughneck king.   O'Banion 
was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer, 
in the North Side's Little Hell, close by the Sicilian quarter 
and Death Corner. He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral 
and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien. The influence 
of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum tenements 
among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust saloons of his birthplace; 
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood, and 
went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging, 
and housebreaking. At the age of ten, when he was working as 
a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted 
in his permanently shortened leg. Because of this he was known as 
Gimpy (but, as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in 
his presence). In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious 
Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's 
Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street, where 
befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing 
waiters before being thrown out. He then got a job with the Chicago 
<Herald-Examiner> as a circulation slugger, a rough fighter 
employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon 
by rival vendors. He was also at the same time gaining practical 
experience as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how to shoot 
to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary, later 
committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes 
misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish 
mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.   O'Banion's first conflict 
with the police came in 1909, at seventeen, when he was committed 
to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary; two years 
later he served another three months for assault. Those were his only 
interludes behind bars, although he collected four more charges on his 
police record in 1921 and 1922, three for burglary and one for robbery. 
But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective. 
On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was 
furnished by an alderman, and the charge was <nolle prossed>. On one 
of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant 
John J& Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour 
office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building; the jury wanted 
better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at a cost of $30,000 
in bribes, it was estimated. As promptly as Torrio, O'Banion jumped 
into bootlegging. He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous 
violence than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side 
portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money. Unlike the 
Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe-cracking 
expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution. He was also personally 
active in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired 
sufficient political might to be able to state: "I always deliver 
my borough as per requirements".   But whose requirements? 
Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had 
kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic. There was a question-and-answer 
gag that went around at that time: Q& "Who'll 
carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards"? A& "O'Banion, 
in his pistol pocket". But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic 
hierarchy 
was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion 
was being wooed by the opposition, and was meeting and conferring 
with important Republicans. To forestall any change of allegiance, 
the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion, 
as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where 
his loyalties lay.   The reception was held in a private dining 
room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West. It was an interesting 
fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers, ward heelers, 
sold-out officials, and gunmen. The guest list is in itself a little 
parable of the state of American civic life at this time. It included 
the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.
When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes 
for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department 
by consorting with these felons and fixers. Hughes said that he had 
understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the 
proprieter of a Loop gambling house. "But when I arrived and recognised 
a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective 
bureau basement half a dozen times, I knew I had been framed, and 
withdrew almost at once".   In fact, O'Connor was honoured 
during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin. 
There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men 
jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering 
him for a tip. Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum 
watch set with rubies and diamonds.   This dinner was the start 
of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians, 
which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, "had been maintained with 
more or less stealth", but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious 
gatherings, denounced by a clergyman as "Belshazzar feasts", 
at which "politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters, 
openly, in the big downtown hotels". Pasley continued: "They 
became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the 
moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments 
in 1928-29".   However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors 
no good whatever. O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes 
to his loyalty, and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican 
deal. On Election Day- November 4- he energetically marshalled 
his force of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat 
votes. The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates.
This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power 
did not please Torrio and Capone. In the past year there had been 
too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement 
for their liking. He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence 
that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards 
them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath 
their blandness. They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as, 
when his bodyguard, Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed 
by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of a Jewish 
gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation, who were Hirschey, 
a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion, 
Frank, a policeman, and Max, the youngest. To settle this 
slight, O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop, 
where, he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening of 
a musical comedy. At the end of the performance, Dave and Max came 
out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed 
first nighters. O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely 
wounding him in the stomach. A second bullet ricocheted off Max's 
belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some distress. O'Banion 
tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither 
prosecuted nor even arrested. That sort of braggadocio, for that sort 
of reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense. 
A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was 
when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street 
and demanded $300 to let it through. One of the beer-runners telephoned 
O'Banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and 
reported the situation. O'Banion's reaction was: "Three hundred 
dollars! To them bums? Why, I can get them knocked off for 
half that much". Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle 
squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out 
to deal with the hijacking policemen. But in the meantime the beer-runner, 
unhappy with this solution, telephoned Torrio and returned to 
O'Banion with the message: "Say, Dionie, I just been talking 
to Johnny, and he said to let them cops have the three hundred. He 
says he don't want no trouble".   But Torrio and Capone had 
graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman. For three years, 
since the liquor territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic 
patience, and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent 
warfare and disaster to business, tolerated O'Banion's impudent 
double-crossing. They had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of 
his sharp practice in Cicero.   When, as a diplomatic gesture 
of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election, 
Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from 
that district had been $20,000 a month. In six months O'Banion had 
boosted the profits to $100,000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure 
to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the 
suburb. These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies 
from the Sheldon, Saltis-McErlane, and Druggan-Lake gangs, 
and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons; 
once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation 
of ill will. The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory 
went up still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone 
takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and 
West Sides. But he still showed no intention of sharing with the 
syndicate. At last, even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still, 
and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage 
in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer 
concession. O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.
Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion 
gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car 
load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest 
coups of the Prohibition era- the Sibley warehouse robbery, 
which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation. Here was 
stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky. These 1750 cases were carted 
off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men, who left in 
their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.
A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake 
or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous of all was launched by the 
explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific 
at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra 
with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away 
as San Francisco.   The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic 
inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale of 
the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth 
may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed, 
a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea 
in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists 
in the Biblical story of the Flood.   One of the most damaging 
tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 
1, 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away 
as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in the Atlantic 
Ocean; they are far more common in the Pacific. Japan has had 15 
destructive ones (eight of them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian 
Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled 
into the Inland Sea; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and 
boats in Osaka Bay. A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 
washed away an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn trees 
standing where the community had been. In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 
27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes.   The dimensions 
of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement. An ordinary 
sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to 
crest- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the 
Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes 
as much as 600 miles from crest to crest. While a wind wave never 
travels at more than 60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in 
the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour. The greater 
the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave; 
Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of 
the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity. In 
the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles 
per hour.   Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length 
that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable. Their amplitude 
sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest. Usually it 
is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build 
up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day in 1896 when the 
great waves approached Japan, fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells. 
Not until they sailed home at the end of the day, through a sea 
strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware of what 
had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water 
from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning 
thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.   The 
giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones. They 
usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into 
a ~V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.
Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell, 
not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers. 
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore 
as the first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and dry, and 
the beaches are covered with stranded fish. At Hilo large numbers 
of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach. 
Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for some 
minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore. After an earthquake 
in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified 
by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher 
ground. When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach, 
fearing that they might be buried under landslides. Just as they reached 
the shore, the first huge wave crashed upon them.   A tsunami 
is not a single wave but a series. The waves are separated by intervals 
of 15 minutes to an hour or more (because of their great length), 
and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great 
wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves may keep coming for many 
hours. Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the 
biggest.   Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was 
Francis P& Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
one of the world's foremost marine geologists. He was able to make 
a detailed inspection of the waves. Their onrush and retreat, he reported, 
was accompanied by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The 
third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some of the islands' 
beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the 
shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come. 
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest waves, 
55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.   Scientists and fishermen 
have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon. During 
a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night. The 
luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the 
stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism <Noctiluca miliaris> 
by the turbulence of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes 
observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have 
enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers 
of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance. The 
waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and 
battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth 
of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.
The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in 
Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised 
by Commander C& K& Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff. 
It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber 
which record the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water 
tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period of between 10 and 
40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding 
oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit. 
This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the 
station that a tsunami is in progress. Such equipment has been installed 
at Hilo, Midway, Attu and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm 
goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which 
is the center of the warning system.   This center also receives 
prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the 
Pacific which are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary 
determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide 
stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By means of charts showing 
wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is 
possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival 
at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific. 
The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger, 
and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps. All 
of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system, 
and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work 
smoothly.   Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami 
in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence. On November 4, 
1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula. 
At 17:07 that afternoon (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded 
by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately 
went into action. Within about an hour with the help of reports 
from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and California, the quake's 
epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees 
East longitude. While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came 
in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported it was covered 
with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian station made its calculations 
and notified the military services and the police that the first big 
wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.   It 
turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946. They hurled a 
cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone 
lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows. 
But not a single human life was lost, and property damage in the Hawaiian 
Islands did not exceed $800,000. There is little doubt that the 
warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.   But it is 
plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough. In the 
vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against 
building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they 
be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.

The key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the 
same. Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the 
sea to complex combinations in man. The land, too, is changing, and 
earthquakes are daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements 
in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes this is accompanied 
by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts 
cannot be seen, but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars 
of earlier breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are most 
numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated, 
but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth 
that has not had them.   The effects of earthquakes on civilization 
have been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role of 
an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously 
frightening, but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular 
disaster. Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know 
about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth 
which emerge with information about the materials through which they 
have traveled. These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface 
a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.
Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface, 
but they do not occur at greater depths. Two unsolved mysteries are 
based on these facts. (1) As far down as 400 miles below the surface 
the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to 
twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface 
rocks do. (2) If earthquakes do occur at such depths, why not deeper?
Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been 
applied in various fields. In the search for oil and gas, we make 
similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from 
them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation 
of these resources. We have also developed techniques for recognizing 
and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the 
ground which they generate.   The following discussion of this subject 
has been adapted from the book {Causes of Catastrophe} by 
L& Don Leet. 
#THE RESTLESS EARTH AND ITS INTERIOR#
<At twelve 
minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday>, April 18, 1906, 
San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake. A sharp tremor 
was followed by a jerky roll.
{IN} Ireland's County Limerick, near the River 
Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which 
means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the residents realize 
the influence their town has had on American military history, 
or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"! 
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was 
the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes, 
Sioux and Apaches, Mexican <banditos> under Pancho Villa, Japanese 
in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists 
in Korea. Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U& S& Cavalry 
Regiment, "The Fighting Seventh".   Today a battle 
cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, <esprit de corps> 
has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables. But don't 
tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a 
saloon on Saturday night.   Of all the thousands of men who have 
served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than 
Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C& Chandler. Wiry and burr-headed, 
with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler 
is the epitome of the old-time trooper. The truth is, however, that 
when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he 
had ever ridden 
was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded 
was a pencil.   Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical 
Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas 
City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make 
the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it. Though 
he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other 
desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces. The 
next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer 
of Troop ~H, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.
Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher 
spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a new ~CO brought in from 
the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper. Second, 
if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's 
on maneuvers. In combat, helping your ~CO make a fool of himself 
might mean getting yourself killed. But in maneuvers, with the top 
brass watching him all the time, it's easy.   Chandler understood 
this and expected the worst. But his first few days with Troop 
~H were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert 
Early. Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice. 
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident. He had 
enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately 
set about learning his new trade. There was no weapon Early could not 
take apart and reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and 
he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's 
correspondence courses. He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, 
history and literature as well.   But for all his erudite 
confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold. 
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved 
Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new ~CO know just how lucky 
he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United 
States Army. He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and 
the regiment. For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry 
under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the 
Battle of The Little Big Horn.   It didn't take Captain 
Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition 
on his shoulders as commander of Troop ~H. But what made the 
load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper 
was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop 
and the regiment.   Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison 
duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was the 
7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial 
Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler was not completely 
convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen". 
The final proof was a small incident.   It happened 
at the St& Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which 
had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains 
of an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler looked 
up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above 
the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen. The faces belonged 
to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And 
when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish 
songs the best.   Though there was an occasional good-natured 
chuckle about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago, 
singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really thought it was strange. 
For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni Martini, the bugler boy 
who carried Custer's last message, or Margarito Lopez, the one-man 
Army on Leyte, was a Garryowen, through and through. It was no 
coincidence 
that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders 
in the regiment.   And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen. 
He set out to keep Troop ~H the best troop in the best regiment. 
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook 
and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the 
troop. Even the mess sergeant, Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer 
from an airborne division, went out on the range.   The troop received 
a new leader, Lieutenant Robert M& Carroll, fresh out of 
~ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status. Carroll was sharp 
and military, but he was up against tough competition for that ~RA 
berth, and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set out to 
sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold 
a short time before.   When the Korean war began, on June 25, 
1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the 
Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead 
of Leyte during World War /2,, the 7th Cavalry was not in the 
best fighting condition. Its entire complement of non-commissioned 
officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit, 
and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World 
War /2,.   Just a month after the Korean War broke out, 
the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat. From 
then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting 
in Korea.   One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler 
called on that fabled <esprit de corps>. The regiment was dug in 
on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building 
up a concentration of crack troops on the other side. The troopers 
knew an attack was coming, but they didn't know when, and they 
didn't know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12, they 
were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against Troop ~H.
The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full 
force of 1000 men, armed with Russian machine guns, attacked the position 
held by Chandler's men. They came in waves. First came the 
cannon fodder, white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive 
human battering ram. They were followed by crack North Korean troops, 
who mounted one charge after another. They overran the 7th Cav's 
forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers, over 
piles of their own dead.   Another force flanked the company 
and took up a position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw 
that it was building up strength. He assembled a group of 25 men, composed 
of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply 
men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill. One of the more 
seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking 
for the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill 
to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.   Then 
Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one step, two, broke 
into a trot and then into a run. The first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"! 
burst from his throat. His followers shouted the old 
battle cry after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.
The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned 
down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire. Chandler, looking to 
right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure 
bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry 
as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued 
with the spirit of Garryowen. He had formed his own task force 
of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge. 
Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been 
pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again. But an enemy 
grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously. He 
went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face 
of 
the withering enemy fire.   Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, 
seeking a soft spot. They found it at the junction between Troops 
~H and ~G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin Goulding saw 
what was happening. He turned to his platoon. "Okay, men", he 
said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward, 
"Garryowen"! on his lips, his men following. But the bullets 
whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding 
fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that 
their lieutenant, 
the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead. 
Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming 
and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy like 
wild men.   That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant 
Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy 
soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements 
came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's 
platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled 
across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes were called in 
to kill them by the hundreds.   Though Bob Carroll seemed to have 
had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived. 
Today he is a major- in the Regular Army.   So filled 
was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was 
over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment. 
After years of digging, nights and weekends, he put together the 
big, profusely illustrated book, <Of Garryowen and Glory>, which 
is probably the most complete history of any military unit. ##
The 
battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle 
cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off. For nearly 
a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the 
regiment.   Take the case of Major Marcus A& Reno, who survived 
the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the enlisted 
men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried 
to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus 
Reno. Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But 
when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice 
made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield 
and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left 
to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him. 
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.   Although it was 
at 
the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been 
written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry 
first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by 
then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's 
first permanent commander and, like such generals as George 
S& Patton and Terry de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military 
prominence, 
Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.   During 
the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant record, was 
made 
brigadier general at the age of 23.   He finished the war as 
a major general, commanding a full division, and at 25 was the youngest 
major general in the history of the U& S& Army. 
I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in 
the sense that everyone agrees with them. If they were, Walter Lippmann 
would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock 
would have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however, that 
<I> take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying 
would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions. _ASSUMPTION 
1._ The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish 
a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom 
and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular- 
since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions 
be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak of "the largest 
possible measure" because any person who supposes that these 
conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons 
without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human 
beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around. _ASSUMPTION 
2._ These conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable 
in the qualified sense I have indicated- without the prior defeat 
of world Communism. This is true for two reasons: because Communism 
is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions; 
and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet 
power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization. Moreover, 
as Communist power increases, the enjoyment of these conditions 
throughout the world diminishes <pro rata> and the possibility of 
their restoration becomes increasingly remote. _ASSUMPTION 3._ It 
follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal 
of American policy. Proximate in the sense that there are more distant, 
more "positive" ends we seek, to which victory over Communism 
is but a means. But dominant in the sense that every other objective, 
no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it. Peace is a worthy 
objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the 
Communists out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the sense 
of self-determination, is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination 
to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into 
the Sino-Soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice 
is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails driving 
the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West, 
then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards 
yet a while longer. Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing 
higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient 
guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and 
denials will have to be made. It may be, of course, that such objectives 
can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism; 
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be 
resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant 
world- the absence of Soviet Communist power. 
#THE USES OF 
POWER#
This much having been said, the question remains whether we 
have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat Communism- 
and, if so, how those resources ought to be used. This brings us squarely 
to the problem of <power,> and the uses a nation makes of power. 
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that 
it always has been, that it always will be. And I suggest further 
that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of 
American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership 
in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously. 
In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting 
the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them 
into proper focus. One was demonstrably false; the other, for the 
most part, true.   The first was that America had become- or 
was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I know I 
do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention. You 
may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment- 
I certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all American 
strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States 
not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the 
development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent 
feature of U&S&-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future.
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority 
on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr& Jameson 
Campaigne has done it well in his new book <American Might and Soviet 
Myth>. Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we 
were in the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000 
modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases 
in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming Russian naval power would 
always be within a few hundred miles of our coast. Half of the population 
of the U&S& would be needed to work on arms just to feed 
the people". Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where 
oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity. 
Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would 
severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the 
missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.   If 
we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's 
nightmarish worries- or, at least, of the worries he might have if 
his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage. 
#U&S& "PRESTIGE"# 
The other charge was that America's political position 
in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years. The 
contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it 
ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to 
see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.
The argument was typically advanced in terms of U&S& "prestige". 
Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem; and 
even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading. Prestige 
is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill. But contrary 
to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important 
for its own sake. Only the vain and incurably sentimental among 
us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed 
by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose sleep over 
is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are 
likely to do about it.   The evidence suggests that foreign peoples 
believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and 
is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead. This ignorant 
estimate, I repeat, is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes 
very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically 
do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be 
the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining U&S& prestige 
means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on 
an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet 
intimidation, there is reason for concern.   Still, these guesses 
about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the 
actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here 
I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and 
overwhelming but of political power- of influence, if you will- 
about which the relevant questions are: Is Soviet influence throughout 
the world greater or less than it was ten years ago? And is Western 
influence greater or less than it used to be? 
#COMMUNIST GAINS# 
In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether 
Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy 
before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform 
are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded: 
the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend 
on such spectacular and definitive conquests. Success may mean merely 
the displacement of Western influence.   Communist political 
warfare, we must remember, is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages. 
Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they 
could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where 
the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla 
skirmishes, 
in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine 
meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, 
on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences- preferably at 
the highest level.   The Soviets understand, moreover, that the 
first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against 
the West. Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover 
is to "neutralize" a country. The second stage is to retain the 
nominal classification of "neutralist", while in fact turning the 
country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy. And 
this may be as far as the process will go. The Kremlin's goal is 
the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States- 
and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade 
under a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries 
of the Soviet Foreign Office.   To recite the particulars of 
recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring.   Six years ago 
French Indochina, though in troubie, was in the Western camp. Today 
Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between 
Communism and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all 
practical purposes, neutralist.   Indonesia, in the early days of 
the Republic, leaned toward the West. Today Sukarno's government 
is heavily besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist" 
pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.   Ceylon 
has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly 
hostile to the West.   In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and 
Egypt were, a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser 
and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent 
for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel; 
in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve. Never 
mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination: 
the point is that in the struggle for the world that 
vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West. Today, 
Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging, 
it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.   Latin America was once 
an area as "safe" for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today 
it is up for grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become 
a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In some countries 
the trend has gone further than others: Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela 
are displaying open sympathy for Castroism, and there is no country- 
save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently 
arranged- where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent 
the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause.
Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the 
surface. The strains of neutralism are running strong, notably in 
England, and even in Germany. 
#OPPORTUNITIES MISSED#
What have 
we to show by way of counter-successes? We have had opportunities- 
clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron 
Curtain. There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised 
and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish Revolution 
which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable 
to Soviet interests. There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended 
did not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively 
and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power: in Guatemala. 
And contrary to what has been said recently, we did not wait for "outside 
pressures" and "world opinion" to bring down that Communist 
government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist 
<coup 
d'etat>. We served our national interests, and by so doing we 
saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.
THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening, 
roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.   "Sounds 
exactly like last time". The young man spoke steadily enough, 
but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven. The middle-aged man 
said over and over, "Why did I come here, why did I come 
here". 
Then he was sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons, 
I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the lights went out.
This was my 
second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of 
Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave. Where was my flashlight? 
Where should I go? To my room? Better stay in the hotel lobby, 
where the walls looked good and thick.   Chinese and Indian 
merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters. Hotel 
attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small 
boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please". 
She held out her hand to show that she had money.   The American 
newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office. But what 
was the story? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this 
far? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane?   "Let's 
play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof and see". 
#GUNFIRE 
SAVES THE MOON#
By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had 
been an eclipse of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that 
the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all 
possible noise, ideally with firearms.   The din was successful, 
too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had 
begun 
to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.   How 
quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant posted a reminder to 
patrons "who became excited and left without paying their checks". 
But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later. 
And no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood, had 
become the City of Bullet Holes.   I saw holes in planes at the 
airport and in cars in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly 
a house had not been peppered. In place of the police headquarters 
was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars had demolished the 
defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door. What 
had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened 
brick.   This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane, 
fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments 
had ruled here in three days (December 9-11, 1960). And now, in March, 
all Laos suffered a state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held 
two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more. 
Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush 
and death.   "And it's all the more tragic because it's 
so little deserved", said Mr& J& J& A& Frans, a Belgian 
official of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization. We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with 
the U& N& flag.   Practically all the people of Laos, he 
explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers, and the means 
and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel 
plows. They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes 
in ten or eleven thousand villages, with an average of 200 souls. 
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are. They spread 
over an area no larger than Oregon; yet they include peoples as different 
from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians. 
#LIFE 
MUST BE KEPT IN HARMONY#
"What matters here is family loyalty; 
faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the <phis>, the spirits; 
and to live in harmony with nature".   Harmony in Laos? 
"Precisely", said Mr& Frans. He spoke of the season of 
dryness and dust, brought by the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony 
with the season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from the southwest. 
The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering 
Mekong River. Shy, slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with 
the frangipani by the wayside. Even life in harmony with death. For 
so long as death was not violent, it was natural and to be welcomed, 
making a funeral a feast.   To many a Frenchman- they came 
95 years ago, colonized, and stayed until Laos became independent in 
1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti. 
Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen 
around the globe. The Pathet Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans 
from neighboring North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft. 
The Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped with 
American funds. In six years, U& S& aid had amounted to more 
than $1.60 for each American- a total of three hundred million dollars.
We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened 
to ignite another war among the world's giants. Even if it 
did not, how would this little world of gentle people cope with its 
new reality of grenades and submachine guns?   To find out, we 
traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled, in 
the daytime at least, by the Royal Lao Army: from Attopeu, the 
City 
of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the City of 
Lions in the northwest, close to Communist China (map, page 250). 
We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil 
between ruts, all four wheels spinning uselessly. We flew in rickety 
planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash. In the 
end we ran into Communist artillery fire.   "We" were Bill 
Garrett of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Illustrations Staff, whose 
three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any 
fighting man we met; Boun My, our interpreter; and myself.
Boun My- the name means one who has a <boun>, a celebration, and 
is therefore lucky- was born in Savannakhet, the Border of Paradise. 
He had attended three universities in the United States. But 
he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane, 
including the royal capital, Luang Prabang. Before the airplanes 
came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible. 
#PRIME 
MINISTER MOVES FAST#
Alas, so it almost proved for us, too. To 
go outside the few cities required permits. and getting them seemed 
a life's work. Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured, and 
few soldiers could be spared as escorts.   We were told that to 
the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped American was worth at least $750, a fortune 
in Laos. Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had 
spurned an escort. Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching 
him barefoot from village to village, as evidence of evil American 
intervention.   Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government 
offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation 
in French, we were getting nowhere. We had nearly decided 
that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true, when we were invited 
to take a trip with the Prime Minister. Could we be ready in 15 
minutes? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of 
town, and he was eager to be off. 
#PRINCE WEARS TEN-GALLON HAT#
And 
so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing 
along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun 
Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket 
and a ten-gallon hat from Texas. From his shoulder bag peeked the 
seven-inch barrel of a Luger.   The temperature rose to 105`. 
With our company of soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.
In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister 
bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks for me. 
Then we drove on, until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice 
fields, bouncing across their squat earth walls.   It was a 
spleen-crushing day. An hour of bouncing, a brief stop in a village to 
inspect a new school or dispensary. More bouncing, another stop, a 
new house for teachers, a new well. Then off again, rushing to keep up. 
We were miserable.   But our two Jeep mates- Keo Viphakone 
from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania- 
were beaming under their coatings of dust. Together they had probably 
done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century- 
constructively. Mr& Keo, once a diplomat in Paris and Washington, 
was Commissioner of Rural Affairs. John, an engineer and anthropologist 
with a doctorate from the London School of Economics, 
headed the rural development division of ~USOM, the United States 
Operations Mission administering U&S& aid.   "What 
you see are self-help projects", John said. "We ask the people 
what they want, and they supply the labor. We send shovels, cement, 
nails, 
and corrugated iron for roofs. That way they have an infirmary 
for $400. We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up to a lot more 
than just roads and wells and schools. Ask Mr& Keo". 
Mr& 
Keo agreed. "Our people have been used to accepting things as 
they found them", he said. "Where there was no road, they lived 
without one. Now they learn that men can change their surroundings, 
through their traditional village elders, without violence. That's 
a big step toward a modern state. You might say we are in the nation-building 
business".   In the villages people lined up to give 
us flowers. Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine. The Prime Minister 
paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode rapidly among the 
houses, joked with the local soldiery, and made a speech. The soldiers 
are fighting and the Americans are helping, he said, but in the 
fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.
Then we were off again. We did it for three days.   But 
our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery. Crossing the 4,000-foot 
width of the Mekong at Champassak, on a raft with an outboard 
motor, we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean 
breeze. Then we hung overboard in the water.   Briefly we rolled 
over a paved road up to Pak Song, on the cool Bolovens Plateau. 
The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported 
by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and fed rice 
to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song. 
#STRINGS 
KEEP SOULS IN PLACE#
In the village of Soukhouma, which means 
"Peaceful", we had a <baci>. This is the most endearing of Lao 
ceremonies. It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing 
for myriad occasions- for the traveler, a wedding, a newborn child, 
the sick, the New Year, for any good purpose.   The preparations 
were elaborate: flowers, candles, incense sticks, rice wine, dozens 
of delicacies, and pieces of white cotton string. The strings were 
draped around flowers in tall silver bowls (page 261).   The 
candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village 
notables. I was careful to keep my feet, the seat of the least worthy 
spirits, from pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits 
reside. Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to 
come and join us.   Next he addressed himself to our souls. A 
man has 32 souls, one for each part of the body. Those souls like to 
wander off, and must be called back.   With the divinities present 
and our souls in place, we were wished health, happiness, and power. 
Then, one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings 
around our wrists. These were to be kept on, to hold in the 32 souls.
As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came up to John 
Cool and silently showed him his hand. It had a festering hole as 
big as a silver dollar. We could see maggots moving.   John said: 
"I have some antiseptic salve with me, but it's too late for 
that".
My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening 
of religious and ethnic bonds. Jewish identity was often confused 
with social and economic strivings. "Being Jewish gives you tremendous 
drive", a boy remarked. "It means that you have to get 
ahead". When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I encountered 
the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith good will, and 
a small residue of ethnic loyalty.   "I like the tradition", 
a girl said. "I like to follow the holidays when they come along. 
But you don't have to worship in the traditional way. You can communicate 
in your own way. As I see it, there's no real difference between 
being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant".   Another teen-ager 
remarked: "Most Jews don't believe in God, but they believe 
in people- in helping people". Still another boy asserted: 
"To be a good Jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person". 
When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant, 
the boy answered, "It's the same thing".   This accords 
with the study by Maier and Spinrad. They discovered that, although 
42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the 
Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings 
of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this 
conviction. The most important aims of the Jewish students were as 
follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent; 
to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence- 
21 per cent.   Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers 
I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even 
envisioned joining a synagogue or temple. However, they were hostile 
to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to believe in Judaism "but in a 
moderate way". One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews: "It's 
the twentieth century, and they don't have to wear beards".
The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked 
force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds. "We were brought 
up that way" was one statement which won general assent. "I 
want to show respect for my parents' religion" was the way in which 
a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism. Still 
another suggested that he would join a temple "for social reasons, 
since I'll be living in a suburb".   Intermarriage, which 
is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not 
with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval. 
Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic 
grounds. "When you marry, you want to have things in common", a 
girl said, "and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your 
own background".   A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle 
West observed wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently interfered 
with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities 
that many middle class Jews now regard as religious. It appears 
that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing 
sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would 
not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food. Another 
girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as "the 
only Orthodox girl in town". This is, no doubt, inaccurate, 
but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the 
nonobservant. 
#THE OLDER TEENS#
One of the significant things about 
Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented. 
Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college 
age attend institutions of higher learning. This is substantially higher 
than the figures for the American population at large- 45.6 per 
cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females. This may help explain 
a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy. In their first two 
years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions 
to win positions on the school teams. However, in their junior and 
senior years, they generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably 
in the interest of better academic achievement. It is significant, 
too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed, unlike the 
younger ones, that Jewish students tend to do better academically than 
their gentile counterparts.   The percentage of Jewish girls 
who attend college is almost as high as that of boys. The motivations 
for both sexes, to be sure, are different. The vocational motive is 
the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls attend college for social 
reasons and to become culturally developed. One of the significant 
developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers 
are largely the women. It is they who read- and make- Jewish 
best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.   In 
upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group tends to have a sense 
of marginality. "People automatically assume that I'm in college", 
a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably. However, among 
the girls, there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going 
to college. The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an 
office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and, buttressed 
by a respectable income, she is likely to dress better and live 
more expansively than the college student. She is even prone to regard 
the college girl as immature. 
#THE LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS COLLEGE STUDENT# 
One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers 
in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend 
local colleges at modest cost. This is particularly true in large centers 
of Jewish population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is 
that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their 
gentile counterparts, 
they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed 
Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish 
world.   Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College- 
constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can 
serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle class Jewish student.
There is, to begin, an important sex difference. Typically, in 
a lower-middle class Jewish family, a son will be sent to an out-of-town 
school, if financial resources warrant it, while the daughter will 
attend the local college. There are two reasons for this. First, 
the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's. Second, 
the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter 
than toward the son. Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise 
vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by 
keeping them home. The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn 
College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically. 
One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.
Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their 
school. On the one hand, there is a sense of not having moved beyond 
the ambiance of their high school. This is particularly acute for 
those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street 
from Brooklyn College. They have a sense of marginality at being denied 
that special badge of status, the out-of-town school. At the same 
time, there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good 
college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable 
virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling 
that the college generates. "It's people of your own kind", a girl 
remarked. "You don't have to watch what you say. Of course, 
I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds 
of people, but I would want lots of Jewish kids there".   For 
most Brooklyn College students, college is at once a perpetuation 
of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood 
and family. @rooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in 
tone, and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably 
midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing. However, a 
growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by 
courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly 
critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents. And 
the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional 
conflict of culture but, rather, a protest against a culture that they 
view as softly and insidiously enveloping. "As long as I'm home, 
I'll never grow up", a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly. 
"They don't like it if I do anything away from home. It's so 
much trouble, I don't usually bother".   For girls, the overprotection 
is far more pervasive. Parents will drive on Friday night 
to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting. 
A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn 
College and demanded the "low-down" on a boy who was going out 
with his daughter. The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice 
of a major field. Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn 
College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with 
marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient 
working hours. This means that a great many academically talented girls 
are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature. 
A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls 
as it does in the realm of sex.   The breaking away from the prison 
house of Brooklyn is gradual. First, the student trains on his 
hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological 
and sociological insights. Then, with the new affluence, there is 
actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide world beyond the precincts 
of New York. It is significant that the Catskills, which used to 
be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb 
of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for 
those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day 
camps. The great world beyond beckons. But it should be pointed out 
that some of the new watering places- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton, 
Long Island, for example- tend to be homogeneously Jewish. 
Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad 
program, a good number of students spend summers in Europe. In 
general, however, the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that 
of the student at Harvard or Smith. And acculturation into the world 
at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after 
college rather than during the four school years.   Brooklyn 
College is Marjorie Morningstar territory, as much as the Bronx or 
Central Park West. There are hordes of nubile young women there 
who, prodded by their impatient mothers, are determined to marry. 
It is interesting that, although the percentage of married students 
is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per 
cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class- 
the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate. "Almost 
everybody in the senior class is married", students say dogmatically. 
And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities, 
and houses (in the House Plan Association) that have good 
news to impart. These announcements are, in effect, advertisements 
for themselves as thriving marriage marts. There are boxed proclamations 
in the newspaper of watchings, pinnings, ringings, engagements, and 
marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity. "Witt House 
happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz 
of Fife House".   The Brooklyn College student shows 
some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models. The Ivy 
League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are as likely to 
dress in rather foppish Continental fashion, or even in nondescript 
working class manner, as they are in the restrained, button-down Ivy 
way. The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts 
out of town, and eye shadow, mascara, and elaborate <bouffant> 
hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel- 
are not unknown even in early morning classes.   Among the 
boys, there is very little bravado about drinking. Brooklyn College 
is distinctive for not having an official drinking place. The Fort Lauderdale 
encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College 
boys. 
This should be used frequently (but shaken before using). For galled 
breasts, the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard 
enough white chalk to make a paste. This could also be used for any 
other skin irritation. Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for 
a short time and then apply this under her breasts.   "Female 
troubles" of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the 
frontier; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind 
in my collection, one for hastening delayed menstruation. The sufferer 
drinks tansy tea.   Bruises, burns, cuts, etc&, occurred frequently 
on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers to these 
problems too. Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of 
raw beefsteak. (Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness 
of the applications which relieved the pain.) Salted butter was 
another 
cure for bruises. Many people agreed that burns should be treated 
with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard, but one informant 
told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed 
watery fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed by 
bathing it with epsom salts. Another swore by vinegar baths for burns, 
and still another recommended salted butter. "Butter salve" or 
"butter ointment" was used for burns, and for bruises as well. This 
was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil; 
when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and bottled. Cow's 
milk was another cure for burns, and burns covered with gum arabic or 
plain mucilage healed quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and 
eyes by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not find a doctor 
at the time. A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings, 
which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat". 
Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results 
were good, but which treatment helped is still not known.   To 
stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds. One old-timer 
said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut, even when on a knuckle, if it 
was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent 
infection. My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy 
for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury 
and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth, over which she poured 
turpentine. He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically 
amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar 
showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw" of tobacco put 
on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing. Or a thin slice 
of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing. One 
old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a 
fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his 
head. His brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached 
the boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the scalp back 
in place, and covered the raw edges with the slices. Then he put a rag 
around the dressing to keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further 
care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no 
scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding, 
and rue was an antiseptic. Until quite recently, "sterile" maggots 
could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface, 
leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.   Tetanus 
could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound. One family 
bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips, or, if these were not 
handy, plain lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the 
wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were cured or prevented 
by "madstones" which the pioneer wore or carried. In 1872 there were 
known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the 
family for 200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds, 
then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.   While nowadays 
we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at 
the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had 
little 
variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused it, a cold pack 
was usually first aid. This might be applied to the top of the nose 
or the back of the neck, pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the 
nostril (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could be 
stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and 
tying in it a knot for each year of his life. Or the victim could chew 
hard on a piece of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in 
his ears.   Old sores could be healed by the constant application 
of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood blisters could 
be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with 
any hard nonpoisonous substance. Felons were cured by taking common 
salt and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing it with equal 
parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on 
a cloth and wrapped around the affected part. As the cloth dried, more 
of the mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the felon was 
supposed to be "killed".   Insect bites were cured in many 
ways. Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; "get a bite, 
spit on it" was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow 
clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings; 
not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular. Chiggers were a 
common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so 
small as to be scarcely visible to the eye, they buried themselves in 
the victim's flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief 
and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased by applying liquid 
bluing. For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half 
a glass of soda was made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by 
scraping an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to bathe the 
painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well 
as soap. Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve 
wasp or bee stings.   Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days; 
to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore. Bed 
slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were placed in cups 
of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate, 
applied with a feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding 
pioneer homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice in their 
hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment, but it did the 
job.   To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should 
be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be removed from the 
eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye. As the seed swelled its glutinous 
covering protected the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder 
and the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove small 
objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle 
would then move toward the nose, where it could be wiped out with 
a wisp of cotton.   Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug, 
used in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and 
one 
ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth. Itching 
skin, considered "just nerves", was eased by treating with 
whiskey and salt. Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider 
in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To cure fungus growths 
on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of 
sassafras bark in a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning 
and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same 
solution. Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and 
had defied other remedies. Frostbite was treated by putting the feet 
and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one hears that 
heat and hot water are used instead. Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus, 
used as well for chilblains. Chilblains were also treated with 
tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.   Boils have always been 
a source of much trouble. A German informant gave me a sure cure 
made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice 
was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped in water 
until it formed a sticky, gummy solution. This was also used for sores. 
Another frequent pioneer difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy 
shoes and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me she has 
used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they 
remove the pain or "fire". Another common cure was to soak the 
feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of 
equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight. 
This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed 
the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.
There were many cures for warts. One young girl told me how her 
mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in 
vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several 
times. Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a 
bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the 
house for seven days. Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's 
sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on 
wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear 
after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did 
just that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy. 
Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie 
it on the wart, and wear it for a week. A simpler method was to tie 
a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way. I 
know this worked. One person recommended to me washing the wart with 
sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato 
three times daily. Another common method was to cut an onion in two and 
place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened 
together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave. As the 
onion decayed, so did the wart.   Sore muscles were relieved by 
an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's 
ubiquitous herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water 
in which two cups of salt had been dissolved. Leg cramps, one person 
tells me, were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the 
body on the heel and pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I 
can testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy 
before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in the back of the leg and in 
the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope 
about the patient's waist.   For sprains and swellings, one 
pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added 
to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.
EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable 
plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock 
the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper 
or <negociant> who in turn supplies him. In instances where 
both of these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation is ideal. 
It may, on occasion, be anything but that. However, by cultivating 
a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain 
whether he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he may 
have been told by salesmen and promoters) and, better yet, whether he 
has a taste for wine. Again, by spreading one's purchases over several 
wine dealers, one becomes familiar with the names and specialties 
of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This is important because, 
despite all the efforts of the French government, an appreciable 
segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a 
misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many 
too many <negociants> who would rather turn a <sou> than amass a 
creditable reputation overseas.   A good <negociant> or shipper 
will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from 
the best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also be the 
one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards 
generally in his own district. These are the wines the French themselves 
use for everyday drinking, for even in France virtually no one 
drinks the <Grands Crus> on a meal-to-meal basis. The <Grands 
Crus> are expensive, and even doting palates tire of them. And certainly, 
in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine 
drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready 
for the <Grands Crus> as a steady diet without frequent recourse 
to <crus> of less renown. There is nothing <infra dig> about a 
good blend from a good shipper. Some of them are very delicious indeed, 
and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately, along with 
others not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable wine dealer 
and constant experimentation- "steering ever from the known to 
the unknown"- are the requisites.   Wine waiters are something 
else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great 
deal, their importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate 
on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and 
some other Latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty 
of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof 
on the customer himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!) 
is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly, if everyone 
in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them, the 
supply would dry up in no time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating, 
argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible 
attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine waiter is, 
paradoxically, the guardian (and not the purveyor) of his cellar against 
the Visigoths. Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible 
supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped 
with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine 
waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence. The one way to 
get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking 
to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter 
is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending 
money. Only then, perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.
Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest 
for several weeks before it is served. This is especially true of 
red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well 
worth the effort. It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter 
of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal. Wine stored 
for a long time should be on its side; otherwise, the cork dries 
and air enters to spoil it. When stacking wine on its side in a bin, 
care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next 
to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling 
around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard 
or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture. 
Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again with ill effects. 
The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine (provided the eye 
has not already spotted it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after 
pulling it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right; 
if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.   Seasonal 
rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely. 
The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five 
degrees, with an allowable range of five degrees above or below 
this, provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged vibration 
is also undesirable; consequently, one's wine closet or cellar 
should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces. If 
one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have 
one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time. 
Light, especially daylight, is always bad for wine.   All in 
all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations 
thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go 
to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without 
further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious 
cork. No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure 
they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning 
is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree 
of purism! But the fact remains that in most restaurants, including 
some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle 
is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered, 
and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place 
while the chef is preparing the meal. A white wine, already at cool 
cellar temperature, may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and 
water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the former is far 
preferable) in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter 
climate, there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow. Though 
by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought 
from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so 
before serving time. It may be a bit cold when poured; but again, 
as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should 
be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is never filled more 
than half full. In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly- 
and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste 
and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or the course), in 
the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting 
stages. The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming 
a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an 
open fire. This invariably effaces any wine's character, and drives 
its fragrance underground.   It should not be forgotten that 
wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly 
in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams, 
Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively. Very old red wines 
often require several hours of aeration, and any red wine, brought from 
the cellar within half an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed 
some air. But white wines never! White wines should be opened 
when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their 
sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse 
or a Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted 
method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white 
wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving 
a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive. 
The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death 
when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air. To quote 
Professor Saintsbury: "The last glass of claret or Burgundy 
is as good as the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem 
or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This does not 
mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there 
is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or 
the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good. If 
this must be done, they should always be corked and kept in a cool place; 
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably 
shorter than those of milk.   A few red wines, notably those 
of the Beaujolais, are better consumed at cellar temperature. By 
tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature- 
if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin 
and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well. Thus, 
red wine must, if possible, never be disturbed or shaken; very old 
red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which 
have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself. 
A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may 
do as much harm as a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually 
and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.   Many 
people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully 
from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without 
disturbing the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and 
insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand 
on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom, 
after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position 
on its side in the cradle.   In France, when one wishes to entertain 
at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the 
restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice 
of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them. The wine 
waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened 
at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on 
end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines, 
be decanted. Decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be- 
practically speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process 
of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead of several 
or more times at the table: hence, a minimum of the undesirable mixture 
of wine and dregs.   Though there are many exceptions, which 
we have noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best consumed 
between two and six years old, and red wines, nowadays, between three 
and ten. Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep 
longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite 
number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into their own until 
they are ten or fifteen years of age, or even more. If a red Bordeaux 
of a good name and year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting, 
leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais, on 
the other hand, <should> be drunk while very young; and Alsatians 
<may> be. 
Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest assured that 
your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter 
and Spirit strictly complied with **h and most particularly in regard 
to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane 
views".   Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation. 
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's 
overseer. An excellent crop was expected that year. 
William, 
who lived in neighboring St& Mary's parish, had taken charge and 
decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated 
for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this plan, citing the 
depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions 
at the plantation. If sold then, the land and improvements might 
bring only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference with 
Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning of Gorham's 
intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother. 
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs, 
he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless 
Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation, 
and Louisiana law required their removal from the state. Gorham 
refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how 
much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the 
North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was 
not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes 
who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid 
his annoyance, although both he and William were furious with their 
Yankee brother. William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen 
that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would 
sue "amicably" to protect his interests.   Palfrey was 
determined 
that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers 
during the transition period before emancipation. If William wished 
to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes 
undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there as are ever 
paid the labor of persons of their sex + age. A disposition to exert 
themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them 
**h to come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our plantation 
+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement". When he heard 
of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could 
be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was willing 
to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block 
his ultimate aim. William was adamant on one point: under no circumstances 
would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his 
and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom. Knowing 
the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the 
number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them 
to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific 
instructions, he agreed to William's condition.   In March 
there was a division of the slaves, and Giffen carried out his instructions 
as nearly as possible. Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded 
in getting a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered 
that your views would be best carried out", he explained, 
"by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend 
the philantrophy of Emancipation. I have also taken the old servants 
of your father as a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages 
of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to 
an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the 
wickedness of slavery, they were put aside after he received an inventory 
of the slave property he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human 
worth in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity, was all 
he needed. Each human being, known only by a given name, had a cash value. 
Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150; 
Rose, a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential, was worth $400. 
In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey 
was giving up close to $7,000.   Palfrey's brothers each received 
lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed 
that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus twenty "black 
souls" were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land 
of free men. Giffen extracted one concession from William: the house 
servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.
Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans for freeing 
his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he could get the necessary approval, 
fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special 
permission. According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty 
years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned the state legislature 
to waive the requirement. Otherwise, freedom would mean removal 
from the state in which "as the place of their past residence from 
birth, or for many years, it would **h be materially for their advantage 
to be at liberty to remain". On March 11 the Louisiana legislature 
voted unanimously to table the petition. News of the legislative 
veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William 
became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt 
in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of 
the New Orleans <Courier,> shouting that the emancipation scheme 
had become a public affair, and that it would reach the "Ears of the 
People on the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".
His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had 
imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves, and to keep 
the family from falling apart over the issue. When Giffen decided 
to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily 
assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers 
would never have any cause to complain of him.   in view of these 
difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana. Giffen had already 
urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters. 
His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him 
to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April. Palfrey 
told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New 
Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence 
that he might be allowed to see his family again.   During his journey 
Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists. In both cases he 
desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived 
in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed him 
enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from the Legislature 
of Louisiana, and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood 
of man". Mrs& Child, who had once apologized for sending 
editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one 
of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before, 
but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana. She agreed to 
take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send 
them north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey consulted 
with Cassius M& Clay on the same subject, but with no apparent 
result.   Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety, 
Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial. Instead 
of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature of his mission, 
he received many calling cards and invitations from "gentlemen of mark, 
on whom I had no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations 
than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of 
the "marked attention and civility" with which the New Orleans 
gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him. The memory of this southern 
hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years 
and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic 
account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas, 
"many of whom were coarse + passionate people, much excited by what 
they heard of my plans". He proceeded with his task bravely- in 
his memoirs, at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should 
have time to boil too high".   Palfrey had already made up his 
mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely 
whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by remaining behind 
condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage. He had a 
short private talk with each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey 
soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others. All the 
slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure 
until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in "their 
own little produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain 
as wage laborers for his account. William's threat that under 
no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious" slaves to mix with 
his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation 
as before. Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to 
have made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience".
From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest 
in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time for their departure 
approached, his solicitousness increased. Should any slave change 
his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage 
at once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally 
established, 
Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters 
in New Orleans and aboard ship. Giffen assured him that the captain 
and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration. 
Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage 
to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation was sold in January, 
1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people 
two months' wages. Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation 
for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined to 
enter into any philanthropic arrangement.   On March 21, 1845 the 
bark <Bashaw> weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee 
Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former 
chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled 
regret and jubilation.   Not all of Palfrey's slaves were 
aboard the <Bashaw>. Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult 
to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants. Two of 
these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen filed a petition for 
permission to emancipate four slaves (all more than fifty years old) 
with the St& Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection, 
which he attributed to a "general Excitement against Abolition 
and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right individuals on the 
jury, and got the permission without further delay.   When the 
Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were, of course, no longer 
slaves. Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of 
the constitution of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and 
equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's 
Chapel to formalize the emancipation. An eyewitness recalled 
how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed 
in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed 
while they listened to the few words that declared them free.
Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction, 
he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes 
as servants. Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in 
the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts. 
Mrs& Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children 
with a Quaker 
family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York. 
This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was 
in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.
But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a 
group more varied in background and interest. Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean, has headed 
the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for 
international cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office 
was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first 
Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs. 
("In the late forties and fifties", Coombs has declared in defining 
his role, "two strong new arms were added to reinforce United 
States foreign policy **h economic assistance and military assistance. 
As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity **h to build 
a third strong arm, aimed at the development of people, at the fuller 
realization of their creative human potential, and at better understanding 
among them".)   Many of the new appointees are art collectors. 
Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital 
with a collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin, 
Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and 
Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps, R& Sargent Shriver, 
Jr&, a Kennedy brother-in-law, collects heavily among the moderns, 
including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury 
Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet, <Femmes dans un jardin>.
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President 
of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation different from 
that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson, 
who had been head of General Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at 
times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara 
is the scholar-businessman. An inveterate reader of books, he chose 
while working in Detroit to live in the University community of 
Ann Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller of 
Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former Rhodes Scholar, Charles 
Hitch, who is author of a study on <The Economics of Defense 
in the Nuclear Age>.   One of the President's special assistants, 
the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry 
L& Stimson of the latter's classic memoir, <On Active Service>. 
Another, Arthur M& Schlesinger, Jr&, has won a Pulitzer 
Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter. The 
Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy as a pianist. 
("It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who **h neither 
know nor understand music", he declared not long ago in proposing 
that White House prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs& Arthur 
Goldberg, wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally 
and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District 
of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a new frontier", she claims. 
"In fact, the search is almost more important than the find".) 
Mrs& Henry Labouisse, wife of the new director of the foreign 
aid program, is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.   The list 
goes on. At last count, sixteen former Rhodes Scholars (see box on 
page 13) had been appointed to the Administration, second in number 
only to its Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice Department's 
Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has won a Pulitzer 
Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster General J& Edward 
Day, who must deal with matters of postal censorship, is himself 
author of a novel, <Bartholf Street,> albeit one he was obliged to 
publish 
at his own expense.   Two men show promise of playing prominent 
roles:   William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has 
been a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in Washington 
about the same time during the early postwar years: Kennedy as the 
young Congressman from Massachusetts; Walton, after a wartime stint 
with <Time-Life>, to become bureau chief for the <New Republic>. 
Both lived in Georgetown, were unattached, and shared an active 
social life. Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become 
one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters, vows that he 
and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days. Nonetheless, they 
found common interests. During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked 
Walton, an utter novice in organization politics, to assist him. 
Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the 
hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted 
to be liaison officer to critically important New York City.
Walton, who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's 
paratroopers during the invasion of France, combines the soul 
of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials 
when, after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House 
with Mrs& Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased the 
joint to see what was there". But his credentials are impeccable. 
Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise 
on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the 
renovation of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will continue 
to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter, strictly ex 
officio, for culture.   A more official representative is the Secretary 
of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon 
first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken man with a lust 
for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight. 
But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians, he displays 
a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments. 
His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals 
such as C& P& Snow, Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.
Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great 
deal more than dams and wildlife preserves. After promoting Frost's 
appearance at the Inauguration, he persuaded the poet to return 
several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet 
members, members of Congress, and other Washington notables gathered 
in the State Department auditorium. The event was so successful 
that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar 
ones from time to time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment 
of the Administration.   His Ideas in this respect, however, 
sometimes arouse critical response. One tempest was stirred up last 
March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue 
of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum, 
would be sent "on indefinite loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's 
birthplace. Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors 
promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his 
own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech he had made two 
years earlier as a Congressman, decrying the more than two hundred 
statues, monuments, and memorials which "dot the Washington landscape 
**h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching 
new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall had proposed 
that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.
He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the 
case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce 
that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no 
desire to "hustle" it out of Washington. The last Congress adopted 
seven bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko, 
the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced. Active 
warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first 
Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac, and T& 
R&'s own living children, who wish to preserve the island as 
a wildlife sanctuary. The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin 
D& Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved with 
his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its critics, "Instant 
Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's headaches, since as supervisor 
of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility 
for building it.   "Washington", President Kennedy 
has been heard to remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency 
and northern charm". There have been indications that he hopes 
to redress that situation, commencing with the White House. One of 
Mrs& Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state 
of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national 
shrine. Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture 
assembled by President Thomas Jefferson, the White House has collected 
a hodgepodge of period pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.
Mrs& Kennedy shows a determination to change all this. 
Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk, hewed from 
the timbers of the British ship H&M&S& <Resolute> and 
presented to 
President Hayes by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President 
in his oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the 
<Gazette des Beaux-Arts,> she found a description of a handsome gilt 
pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe. She traced 
it to a storage room. With its coating of gold radiator paint removed- 
a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its 
rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White 
House.   But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century 
furniture (which Mrs& Kennedy feels is the proper period 
for 
the White House) must be pursued in places other than government storage 
rooms. 
The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee 
for the White House, to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange 
ways to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living Presidents 
on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes 
no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee, headed by Henry 
Francis Du Pont, contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats.
The press releases emanating from the White House give 
a clue to the activity within. A curator has been appointed. A valuable 
pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore 
Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein 
and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute 
of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library. Secretary 
and Mrs& Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire 
furniture, including Dolley Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room 
in that style. And part of a fabulous collection of <vermeil> hollowware, 
bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs& Margaret 
Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display 
in the State dining room.   Woman's place is in the home: 
man must attend to matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems 
to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just 
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Congress had 
already appropriated money, and plans were well along to tear down the 
buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one 
critic calls the "marble monumentality" of government office buildings. 
While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to 
preserve the Belasco Theater, as well as the Dolley Madison and the 
Benjamin Taylor houses, all scheduled for razing.   What to 
do about it now that he was President? Only a few days after moving 
into the White House. Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square. 
Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem 
to him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided it 
didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.   The situation 
involved some political perils. One of the offices slated for reconstruction 
is the aged Court of Claims, diagonally across the street 
from the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown. But 
Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court, is an elderly 
gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk 
to work. More importantly, he also happens to be the brother-in-law 
of Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.   There were aesthetic 
problems as well as political. On delving deeper, Walton discovered 
that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified 
as "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over which many 
people had grown sentimental, was only a shell of its former self 
after arduous years as a ~USO Center. The Dolley Madison House, 
Walton concluded, was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt 
to save the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half a 
century too late". 
Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious and beautiful. The 
buildings are mostly Georgian. The Dartmouth student does not live 
in monastic seclusion, as he once did. But his is still a simple life 
relatively free of the female presence or influence, and he must go 
far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated pleasures. He is 
still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence, if he chooses to be.
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the 
last century, down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal 
for book learning in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's 
Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven. 
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend, 
toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke, are no less rakish than 
those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia. But there has 
always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate 
and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment. No one 
here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie 
probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League. It even affects 
the faculty.   Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival- 
widely recognized as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend 
anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup, 
Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter 
garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been 
acquired from a Smith girl. President Dickey's golden retriever, 
frolicking in the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine 
informality.   This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up 
again in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour, wearing 
ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival. 
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown 
on her head. So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.
Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal 
<sang-froid>. For example, groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut 
River. This is in honor of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped 
a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in 
his own student days. And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated 
today. They are hailed by the nation's press, and Smith girls throng 
the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the <voyageurs> with 
hot soup and kisses.   Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic 
recreation is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand 
pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United 
States, the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team 
as another name for their own. Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant 
member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union, which includes the winter 
sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country.   Dartmouth 
students ski everywhere in winter, starting with their own front 
door. They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him, or move 
out to Oak Hill, where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway, 
at Holt's Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the best 
terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.   Forty 
miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's own mountain. 
Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President Dickey acts as host every 
year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth 
Outing Club to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn 
virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining, sleeping, or 
lounging in its huge living room. The Outing Club also owns a chain 
of fourteen cabins and several shelters, extending from the Vermont 
hills, just across the river from the college, through Hanover to the 
College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in 
the logging country. The cabins are equipped with bunks, blankets, 
and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips. 
The club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of the students 
prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting, 
fishing, climbing, or skiing.   Under the auspices of the Outing 
Club, Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes 
on tough climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose interests 
are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's Team, which 
competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and 
chopping, 
canoe races, and the like.   There is much to be said for a college 
that, while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives 
its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along 
back roads where a glimpse of small game, deer, or even bear is not 
uncommon. City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle 
or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly in a backwoods 
logging camp. And on the summit of Mount Washington, where thirty-five 
degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered 
higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of wisdom 
to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas "because 
it is there".   There is much to be said for such a college- 
and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too 
loudly. Their affection for their college home has even caused President 
Dickey to comment on this "place loyalty" as something rather 
specially Hanoverian.   Probably a lawyer once said it best for 
all time in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in the 
nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about 
for a way to found its own state university. It fixed on Dartmouth College, 
which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered. The 
legislators decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war 
with the college trustees over the control of classrooms, faculty, 
and chapel. For a time there were two factions on the campus 
fighting for possession of the student body.   The struggle was 
resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing 
cases in our judicial history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating 
the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters. A lawyer, 
hired by the college, was arguing specifically for Dartmouth: 
Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made her plight the dramatic focus 
of his whole plea. In an age of oratory, he was the king of orators, 
and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly 
tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax:   "It 
is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those 
who love it **h".   Dartmouth is today still a small college- 
and still a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.   This 
is not out of keeping with its origins, probably the most humble of 
any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock, a Presbyterian minister, 
founded the school in 1769, naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth, 
its sponsor and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain, 
found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands 
built the first College Hall, a log hut dedicated "for the education 
+ instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, 
writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and 
expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children of Pagans as well 
as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth 
and any others".   It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's 
was indeed "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to 
be 
hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to 
permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first 
Dartmouth commencement in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully 
brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still 
one of the cherished possessions of the college.   The exuberance 
on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings. 
A student orator "produced tears from a great number of the learned" 
even before the punch was served. Then from the branches of a 
near-by tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform and 
the English language, harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue. 
Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green 
beneath the three-hundred-foot pines, and a barrel of rum was broached. 
The cook got drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man 
of broad talents by carving the ox himself.   Future commencements 
were more decorous perhaps, but the number of graduates increased 
from the original four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the 
nineteenth 
century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and Penn 
were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine. 
The dormitories, including the beloved Dartmouth Hall, could barely 
house two hundred students in Spartan fashion.   Then in 1893 
Dr& William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's 
great awakening began. He transformed Dartmouth from a small New 
Hampshire institution into a national college. By 1907 the number of 
undergraduates had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in 
that year, Dr& Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence 
of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the 
college. The presidents of Cornell, Wisconsin, C&C&N&Y&, 
Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard 
and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.
Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today, with approximately 
twenty-nine hundred undergraduates. But it has achieved a 
cross-section of students from almost all the states, and two-thirds of 
its undergraduates come from outside New England. Over 450 different 
schools are usually represented in each entering class. Only a dozen 
or so schools send as many as six students, and there are seldom more 
than fifteen men in any single delegation. About two-thirds of the 
boys now come from public schools.   It is still a college only 
and not a university; it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy 
group. However, three distinguished associated graduate schools offer 
professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical School (third oldest 
in the country and founded in 1797), the Thayer School of Engineering, 
and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. All 
three are purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment of 
about two hundred.   All three schools coordinate their educational 
programs with that of the undergraduate college and, like the college 
proper, 
place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation 
for specialized study. Students of the college who are candidates 
for the A&B& degree and can satisfy the academic requirements 
of the medical and business schools, may enter either of these associated 
schools at the beginning of senior year, thus completing the 
two-year postgraduate course in one year. The Thayer School offers 
a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins 
a B&S& in engineering.   So Dartmouth is moving closer 
to the others in the Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member 
of the League, if not in years at least in the catching up it has 
had to do. It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span 
the other Ivies have enjoyed. However much football has been over-emphasized, 
the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by 
the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its record a thought again 
since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth 
had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national 
recognition.   It has come on with a rush in more significant areas. 
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions 
might consider somewhat breathtaking. But Dartmouth preserves 
its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes, and, although 
some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage, they 
make for lively copy.   President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed 
to corral an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover. 
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified. It was 
a busy street, conveniently near the shopping center, and unattended 
horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.   There are, 
of course, many weaknesses in any case against Emma. She didn't like 
her stepmother, but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before 
the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had no 
way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed. 
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized 
during her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy, 
the stableman might have recognized her. If police had checked on 
her more thoroughly than is indicated, she would be completely eliminated 
as a suspect. ##
Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate 
popular suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden 
home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him, 
although he clearly intended to stay overnight, if not longer.
Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were 
in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders, she had been 
disturbed by their voices and had closed her door, even though it was 
a very hot day.   It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything 
she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse. At that 
time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S& Phillips. 
A few years ago, not too long before his death, Phillips revealed 
in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders. 
He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that 
day, information which must have come from Lizzie. It was obviously 
the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door.
The New Bedford <Standard-Times> has reported Knowlton 
as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew what Borden said 
during his conversation with Morse, he would have convicted "somebody". 
Notice, Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a 
conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have convicted 
"somebody".   It is known that Morse did associate with 
a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at 
Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were a vagabond lot 
and considered to be shady and undesirable characters. Fall River police 
did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against 
Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from 
among these men. These officers found no incriminating information.
Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He said he 
returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar. The woman 
in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said 
she left when he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a 
fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve noon. If this woman 
had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping, she would have 
had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was 
eaten at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse told the woman 
it was 11:20, but it could have been earlier, since she did serve 
dinner on time. Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi. 
They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he 
had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger. Questioned 
further, Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding 
on the same car with him. The conductor did recall having priests 
as passengers and this satisfied police, although the conductor also 
pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests 
riding on almost every trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement 
really proved nothing.   We do know that Morse left the house 
before nine o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through the 
side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door. 
From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked 
leisurely to where his niece was staying, more than a mile away. 
He met nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting of his movements 
in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs& 
Borden was killed.   Morse testified that while he was having 
breakfast in the dining room, Mrs& Borden told the servant, "Bridget, 
I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's testimony 
was in direct contradiction. She said it was after she returned 
from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs& Borden told 
her to wash the windows. This was long after Morse had left the house.
Morse's knowledge of what Mrs& Borden told Bridget could 
indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden 
there. He knew the house fairly well, he had been there on two previous 
visits during the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's 
attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than 
a drum, this was not true. The screen door was unlocked for some ten 
or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back. It was unlocked 
all the time she was washing windows. Morse could have returned 
openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room 
he had occupied. Mrs& Borden would not have been alarmed if she 
saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm 
the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet 
at the farm. Mrs& Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him 
and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she 
could cry out. He could have left for Weybosset Street after her 
murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.   If 
he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return, he could 
have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr& Borden came 
home. With Lizzie in the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget 
upstairs in her attic room, he would have had free and easy access to 
the house. With the second murder over, he could have left, hidden the 
weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood. 
His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, 
with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding 
the side door, was odd. There was no close examination of his 
clothes for bloodstains, and certainly no scientific test was made of 
them. And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing, 
a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.
The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was 
no financial gain for Morse in the murders.   On the other side 
of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with 
whom she was staying. The time would have been shortly after the 
murder of Mrs& Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior. 
He said he had promised Mrs& Borden to return in time for dinner 
and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden 
house. ##
What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible 
suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:   "The 
police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr& Morse as in 
possession of guilty knowledge. Neither had any interest in the deaths; 
indeed, it was probably to Mr& Morse's advantage to have 
Mr& and Mrs& Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated 
by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion of Bridget 
Sullivan as a possible suspect.   Although Pearson disbelieved 
almost everything Lizzie said, and read a sinister purpose into almost 
everything she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget 
as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be said about the 
servant girl.   The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration, 
but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported in the 
testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer had asked Lizzie 
if she suspected her Uncle Morse, and she replied she didn't 
think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned 
after them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie 
pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her 
room 
before her father's murder and came down when she called her.
Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told police about 
the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some 
weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of 
town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner. 
And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington, she also did not 
accuse him. At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew 
anybody her father had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings 
toward 
her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has not been 
friendly with him. They have not been friendly for years". Asked 
who this was, she named Harrington. Her statement certainly was true; 
the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview, 
but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the 
killer.   When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up pears 
in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in the household besides 
Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the 
murders. He said he had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget 
Sullivan"? I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there", 
he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant 
she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed 
at the time of the murders.   Everyone somehow manages to overlook 
completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two 
people in and about the house at the time of both murders: Lizzie 
Borden and Bridget Sullivan.   All the officials on the case 
seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was 
concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of 
servants who have murdered their employers. True, it is no longer cricket 
for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing 
here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters 
and situations.   The actions of Bridget should be examined, 
since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her 
innocence. There are also other factors that require closer examination.
The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes 
the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the 
trial with a "big bundle" of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping 
her mouth shut. The people who believe and retell the legend have 
apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know 
that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to 
the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget did get any bundles of cash, 
the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would 
have been Lizzie Borden.   Bridget was born in Ireland, one 
of fourteen children. She was apparently the pioneer in her family because 
she had no close relatives in this country at that time. She worked 
as a domestic, first in Newport for a year, and then in South 
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for another year. She finally settled in Fall 
River and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs& Reed, was 
hired by the Bordens.   I have previously described how, during 
the week of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing 
and ironing clothes. 
Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in 
the famous introduction to the <Scarlet Letter> as one of those who 
came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor 
of the port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr& Upton possessed 
intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a devoted Christian. 
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical 
subjects. Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad 
interests.   There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood 
had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye, a retentive memory, 
and a critical faculty. When she was nine years old, she wrote 
a description of a store she had visited. She named 48 items, and said 
there were "many more things which it would take too long to write". 
An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years of age quoted the 
Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada, 
and the views of George Washington.   Lucy Upton was graduated 
from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and 
Elmira, were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning 
that could not be denied.   A picture of her in high school comes 
from a younger schoolmate, Albert S& Flint, friend of her brother 
Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer. He recalled 
Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly 
through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little 
recitation room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive 
mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected 
to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men. 
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this. With four younger 
children at home, Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after 
the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's comfort 
and stay until he died in 1879. But even so Lucy could not give up 
her intellectual pursuits. When her brother Winslow became a student 
at Brown University in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history 
he was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof& Diman's 
definition of civilization, and take the world through, is its progress 
ever onward, or does it retrograde at times? Do you think I 
might profitably study some of the history you do, perhaps two weeks 
behind you **h". And that she proceeded to do.   Many years later 
(on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon 
to be graduated from Smith College: "While I love botany which, 
after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods 
of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating 
to take up zoology in the way you are doing. Whatever was the 
science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite 
study. Mathematics came next".   Her study of history 
was persistently pursued. She read Maitland's <Dark Ages>, "which 
I enjoyed very much"; La Croix on the <Customs of the Middle 
Ages>; 16 chapters of Bryce "and liked it more and more"; 
more chapters of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's <Eastern Church>. 
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions 
that came to her as she studied alone.   Lucy's correspondence 
with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken 
up with academic studies. She played chess with him by postcard. 
Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could 
make the most words from the letters in "importunately". Who won 
is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 
1,212 words.   There was another family interest also. Winslow 
had musical talents, as had his father before him. At different times 
he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist. And it was 
Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music 
at Spelman College.   Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown 
University and two years of graduate study, accepted a position 
at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was connected with 
the U&S& Naval Observatory and with the U&S& Signal Corps; 
and after 1883, was professor of astronomy at Brown University. 
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was 
a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as 
to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's death, Lucy 
and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington, 
D&C&. "Their house", writes Albert S& Flint, 
"was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful 
to one like myself far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the 
household. Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor. Winslow, 
as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize 
her as "our iron sister". There is reason to suppose that Lucy 
would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother 
had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about 
to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert S& Flint expressed 
his conviction that "her physical strength, her mental power, her 
lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve 
her fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished career 
amongst the noted women of this country".   While in Washington, 
D&C&, Lucy Upton held positions in the U&S& Census 
Office, and in the Pension Bureau. They were not sufficiently challenging 
however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her 
brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study. After the 
months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church 
and community life.   What was called an "accidental meeting" 
with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman. 
Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence with Miss 
Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came 
to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although 
there was then no money available to pay her a salary. She served for 
a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.
Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship 
and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students; 
of her "great power of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness 
of dress", "her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts 
of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants and birds; 
and her close knowledge of individual students.   She drew 
on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them 
at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on 
her purse as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only 
because of her unobtrusive help.   Under Miss Upton, the work 
of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption. After all, 
she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except 
for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She had taught classes 
in botany, astronomy (with the aid of a telescope), geometry, 
and 
psychology.   Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact, 
had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring minds; and 
both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the 
development of sturdy character and Christian zeal. Both loved the 
out-of-doors, including mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890 
when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss 
Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and "with rare 
executive ability" bore the brunt of "the entire pilgrimage from 
beginning to end". So strenuous it was physically, with its days of 
horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance 
for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived on 
it.   At the Fifteenth 
Anniversary (1896) as already quoted, Miss 
Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future 
as a college of first rank, with expanding and unlimited horizons. 
When Dr& Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined 
to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley 
(April 7, 1923) "**h If you had asked me, I think I would have 
suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton. Her services 
to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I 
have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her".
Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary 
after the death of Miss Giles.   At the meeting of the 
Board of Trustees, on March 3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual 
report of the President. She noted that no student had been withdrawn 
through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase 
of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work 
had gone forward smoothly. She urged the importance of more thorough 
preparation for admission. The raising of the $25,000 Improvement 
Fund two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous "praise 
demonstration" held afterward on the campus, were reported as 
events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles. With the Fund in 
hand, the debt on the boilers had been paid; Rockefeller and Packard 
Halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken 
for the superintendent's home. Miss Upton spoke gratefully of 
the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise 
the Fund, and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly 
needed current expenses. She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the 
many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the 
years had made the work so fruitful in results.   Two bequests 
were recorded: one of $200 under the will of Mrs& Harriet A& 
Copp of Los Angeles; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia 
L& Brett of Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.
Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles 
was "the sorest grief" the Seminary had ever been called upon 
to bear. The daughters of Spelman, she said, had never known or thought 
of Spelman without her. The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier 
had caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles. 
Now the school was indeed bereft. "Yet Spelman has strong, deep roots, 
and will live for the blessing of generations to come". #@# 
Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became ill in 
March, 1910; and when school closed, she was unable to travel to Massachusetts. 
She remained in Atlanta through June and July; she 
died on August sixth.   Before coming on a visit to Spelman 
in 1885, Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and 
her position there was held open for her for a considerable period. But 
she decided to stay at Spelman. She helped with teaching as well 
as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes 
in geography, rhetoric and bookkeeping. Soon the office work claimed 
all her time. She was closely associated with the Founders in all 
their trials and hardships. Quiet and energetic, cheerful and calm, 
she too was a power in the development of the seminary. Miss Giles 
always used to refer to her as "Sister". She served as secretary 
in the Seminary office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence, 
records, and bookkeeping. The books of the school hold a memorial 
to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.
Mary J& Packard, states a <Messenger> editorial, was "efficient, 
pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating the spirit of her 
Master. With infinite patience she responded to every call, no matter 
at what cost to herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to 
have the needed information or word of cheer.
In a few school districts one finds a link between school and 
job. In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money, 
there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer 
on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other. In these cases 
a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program, saving 
a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12. The apprentice 
program will involve further education on a part-time basis, usually 
at night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high 
school. These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such 
crafts as auto mechanics, carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die 
work, and sheet-metal work.   Formally organized vocational 
programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to 
gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time 
job on graduation. The "diversified occupations" program is a 
part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on 
a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business 
employers. The "distributive education" program operates in 
a similar way, with arrangements between the school and employers in 
merchandising 
fields. In both cases the student attends school half-time 
and works in a regular job the other half. He receives remuneration 
for his work. In a few places cooperative programs between schools 
and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing 
the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are 
immediately marketable upon graduation.   Adult education courses, 
work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of 
a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities 
for out-of-school youth. In general, however, it may be said 
that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school, the school authorities 
play little or no part in the decision of what happens next. If the 
student drops out of high school, the break with the school is even 
more complete. When there is employment opportunity for youth, this 
arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well. Indeed, 
in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities 
have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were 
potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and 
went to work. Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation, 
although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in 
retrospect may have been a wise one. I make no attempt to measure the 
enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work 
on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business 
which he entered. He may or may not be "better off" than his 
classmate who went on to a college and professional school. But in 
the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all 
the potential professional talent.   In a later chapter dealing 
with the suburban school, I shall discuss the importance of arranging 
a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any 
high school where he is found. In the Negro neighborhoods and also 
to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of 
identification and motivation. High motivation towards higher education 
must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches 
grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are 
essential for academic work. Undoubtedly far more can be done in the 
lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools. However, the teacher 
can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family 
is anti-intellectual. And the fact remains that there are today few 
shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership. 
This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern 
universities. Quite the contrary, as I can testify from personal 
experience as a former university president. Rather we see here 
another vicious circle. The absence of successful Negroes in the world 
of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among 
Negro youth for academic careers. I believe the situation is improving, 
but the success stories need to be heavily publicized. Here again 
we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated 
as Negroes in the press. How can the vicious circle be broken? This 
is a problem to which leaders of opinion, both Negro and white, 
should devote far more attention. It is at least as important as the 
more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South. 
#VOCATIONAL EDUCATION#
I should like to underline four points 
I made in my first report with respect to vocational education. First 
and foremost, vocational courses should not replace courses which 
are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation. Second, 
vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and 
not require more than half the student's time in those years; however, 
for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to 
begin earlier. Third, the significance of the vocational courses is 
that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize 
the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers, and this 
sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they 
are studying at the same time. Fourth, the type of vocational training 
programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the 
general locality. This last point is important because if high school 
pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain 
vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training, 
the whole idea of relevance disappears. Vocational training which 
holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable 
skill becomes just another school "chore" for those whose interest 
in their studies has begun to falter. Those who, because of population 
mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees, 
would limit vocational education to general rather than specific 
skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind 
of school experience.   I have been using the word "vocational" 
as a layman would at first sight think it should be used. I intend 
to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys 
and girls. These courses develop skills other than those we think of 
when we use the adjective "academic". Practically all of these practical 
skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained 
in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at 
once on the basis of the skill. They are in this sense skills marketable 
immediately on graduation from high school. To be sure, in tool-and-die 
work and in the building trades, the first job must be often 
on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time vocational training 
enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status. 
Similarly, a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography 
and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job 
at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two 
of further study in a community college or secretarial school. Of course, 
it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and 
with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill. So, too, is the 
mathematical 
competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics. 
In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be 
considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student 
in his vocation (which may be a profession) will be called upon to use 
some of the skills developed and the competence obtained. In spite 
of the shading of one type of course into another, I believe it is useful 
to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses. 
Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which 
proves the rule. Today many college bound students try to take a 
course in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of mastery of 
this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work 
in college and a professional school.   Most of our largest 
cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools. 
In this respect, public education in the large cities differs from education 
in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts. The 
neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking, comprehensive schools, 
because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational 
or technical high school instead of the local school. Indeed, one 
school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term 
comprehensive 
high school for the senior high schools in his city, because 
these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs. He prefers 
to designate such schools as "general" high schools. The suburban 
high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely comprehensive 
high school because of the absence of vocational programs. The reason 
is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community. Therefore 
employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan 
area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic 
of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.
The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities 
must be reckoned as permanent institutions. By and large their programs 
are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and 
to the realities of the apprentice system. It is not often realized 
to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of 
employment, except for a lucky few. One has to talk confidentially with 
some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a 
boy cannot just say, "I want to be a plumber", and then, by doing 
good work, find a job. It is far more difficult in many communities 
to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval 
than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation. 
Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind. One vocational instructor 
in a city vocational school, speaking of his course in a certain 
field, said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs <outside> 
of the city. In the city, he said, the waiting list for those 
who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside 
track he can't get in. In a far distant part of the United States, 
I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade 
was doing special work. "What does he have in mind to do when he 
graduates"? "Oh, he'll be a plumber", came the answer. "But 
isn't it almost impossible to get into the union"? I asked. 
"He'll have no difficulty", I was told. "He has very good 
connections".   In my view, there should be a school which offers 
significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every 
family in a city. Ideally these schools should be so located that 
one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is 
at the highest.   An excellent example of a successful location 
of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School 
in Chicago. Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment, 
this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational 
aims of its students. Hardly a window has been broken since 
Dunbar 
first was opened (and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many 
slum areas). I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost 
all the pupils were Negroes. They were learning trades as diverse 
as shoe repairing, bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics, 
and airplane mechanics. The physical facilities at Dunbar are 
impressive, but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils.
The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the 
world. In the United States, where half of the world crop is grown, 
soybeans are processed for their edible oil. The residue from soybean 
processing goes mainly into animal feeds.   Soybeans are extensively 
processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient. 
American chemists, seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have 
adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their 
use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh 
of Indonesia. Soybean flour, grits, flakes, "milk", and curd can 
be bought in the United States.   Peanuts are the world's 
second most important legume. They are used mainly for their oil. We 
produce peanut oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed. 
Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating 
as nuts, are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off.
Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans, 
comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of 
Asia and Africa.   In western Europe and North America, where 
the level of economic development is higher, grains and other seed 
products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed. Rather, 
meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy products are the main sources of 
carbohydrate, 
protein, oils, and fats. People depend less on seeds for 
foods in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive grazing 
lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption of meat is high.
Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's 
cereal crop in 1957-1958. Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy 
cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry. About 90 percent 
of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals. The rest 
is used for human food and industrial products. More than half of the 
sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the 
milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.
More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed 
to livestock annually in the United States.   The efficiency 
with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily 
in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased 
feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds 
are processed for oil. ##
THE DEMAND for food is so great in 
the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood 
crops. Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor 
position.   Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial 
uses are the oil-bearing seeds- flax, castor, tung (nuts from 
the China wood-oil tree), perilla (from an Oriental mint), and oiticica 
(from a Brazilian tree).   Oils, or liquid fats, from the 
seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints 
and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood 
and metal. These oils develop hard, smooth films when they dry and form 
resinlike substances.   The artist who paints in oil uses drying 
oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the 
ages. One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds.
Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape yield semidrying 
oils. Some are used in paints along with drying oils. Palm oil 
protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin.
Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out of style as a 
medicine. This nondrying oil, however, is now more in demand than ever 
before as a fine lubricant, as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically 
operated equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.
Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used extensively 
in perfumery to extract flower fragrances. It is still used in drugs 
and cosmetics, but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with 
oils from peach and plum seeds.   Liquid fats from all these 
oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household 
and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives.
Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel oil- seed 
oils that are produced primarily for food purposes- also are used 
to make soaps, detergents, and paint resins.   Solid fats from 
the seeds of the mahua tree, the shea tree, and the coconut palm are used 
to make candles in tropical countries.   Seeds are a main source 
of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world. 
Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada, 
and Australia. In other countries where cereal grains are not 
among the principal crops of a region, starchy tubers or roots are processed 
for starch. Starch is used in the paper, textile, and food-processing 
industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.
Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium (fleawort), flax, 
and locust (carob) seeds in ancient times. Today the yearly import 
into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds; 
of psyllium seed, more than 2.6 million. The discovery during 
the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust 
gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the 
United States.   Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs 
and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners, stabilizers, 
or dispersing agents. Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes 
ice cream. Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting 
lotions. Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium was sold 
in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands. 
Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers 
in making paper. ##
THE SEEDS of hard, fibrous, stony fruits, 
called nuts, provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other materials 
of value. Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel 
and its thick, adherent, brown covering- the seedcoat.   The 
kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts, hazelnuts, hickory 
nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts are predominantly oily. Almonds 
and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein. 
Chestnuts are starchy. All nut kernels are rich in protein. 
The world production of familiar seed nuts- almonds, brazil nuts, 
filberts, and the English walnuts- totals about 300 thousand tons annually.
Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the largest 
of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a 
crop for domestic and export markets. The oil palm of West Africa yields 
edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit. 
World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut, 
was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959. Exports from producing 
countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million 
tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about 
half was palm oil.   Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include 
the spicy nutmeg; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing power 
to natural saponins; the marking nut, used for ink and varnish; the 
aromatic sassafras nut of South America; and the sweet-smelling 
cumara nut, which is suited for perfumes.   A forest crop that has 
not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm. 
The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized 
seed. It is used for making buttons and other small, hard objects of 
turnery. Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and 
faces of dolls sold to tourists. ##
THE COLOR AND SHAPE of 
seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations.
Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from jobs-tears- 
the seeds of an Asiatic grass. Bead tree seeds are the necklaces 
of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba. 
Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.
Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety 
of seeds collected during the year.   Tradition has assigned 
medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils, 
and highly flavored components. Although science has given us more effective 
materials, preparations from anise, castorbean, colchicum, nux 
vomica, mustard, fennel, and stramonium are familiar to many for the 
relief of human ailments. Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still 
are used by some persons.   Peanut and sesame oils often are 
used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection.
Still another 
group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing 
fruits) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the 
nutrients they supply are quite negligible. The common spices, flavorings, 
and condiments make up this group.   Each year millions of 
pounds of anise, caraway, mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils 
extracted from them are imported.   Single-seeded dry fruits used 
for flavoring include several of the carrot family, such as cumin, 
dill, fennel, and angelica. Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages 
include fenugreek (artificial maple flavor) and cardamom. White 
pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit.   Sesame 
seed, which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt, 
Brazil, and Central America, has a toasted-nut flavor and can be 
used in almost any dish calling for almonds. It is a main flavoring for 
halvah, the candy of the Middle East. Sesame sticks, a snack dip, 
originated in the Southwest.   Beverages are made from seeds 
the world over.   Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds 
of the coffee tree. World production of coffee broke all previous 
records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons. Per capita consumption 
remains around 16 pounds in the United States.   Cocoa, 
chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao 
tree. World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between 
Africa (63 percent) and South America (27 percent).   Several 
soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts, the seed of the kola 
tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America.   Cereal 
grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages. 
The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain. Arrack is 
distilled from fermented rice in India.   Beer, generally fermented 
from barley, is an old alcoholic beverage. Beer was brewed by the 
Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago. Brewers 
today use corn, rice, and malted barley.   Distillers use corn, 
malt, wheat, grain sorghum, and rye in making beverage alcohol. ## 
SEED CROPS hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy 
of the United States.   The farm value of seeds produced in this 
country for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly 10 billion 
dollars a year. Cereal grains, oilseeds, and dry beans and peas account 
for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised.
The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater, because 
additional returns are obtained from most of the corn, oats, barley, 
and sorghum- as well as the cake and meal from the processing 
of flaxseed, cottonseed, and soybeans- through conversion to poultry, 
meat, and dairy products.   Seeds furnish about 40 percent of 
the total nutrients consumed by all livestock. Hay and pasture are the 
other chief sources of livestock feed.   Seeds are the essential 
raw materials for milling grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining 
edible oil, brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.   More than 11 
thousand business establishments in the United States were based on 
cereals and oilseeds in 1954. The value of products from these industries 
was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third was created 
by manufacturing processes. Not included was the value of seed oil in 
paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries 
that are based on imported seed or seed products.   Cereal grains 
furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American 
diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock 
and poultry.
To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home 
was called "locatin'" 'em. To keep 'em scattered somewhat 
and yet herd 'em was called "loose herdin'". To hold 'em in 
a compact mass was "close herdin'". Cattle were inclined to remain 
in a territory with which they were acquainted. That became their 
"home range". Yet there were always some that moved farther and 
farther out, seekin' grass and water. These became "strays", 
the term bein' restricted to cattle, however, as hosses, under like 
circumstances, were spoken of as "stray hosses", not merely "strays".
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it 
was over. You couldn't stop 'em; you had to go with 'em or wait 
till the storm was over, and follow. Such marchin' in wholesale 
numbers was called a "drift", or "winter drift", and if the storm 
was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the 
range. The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number 
of them animals. The single animal or a small bunch were referred 
to as "strays"; but when a large number were "bunched up" 
or "banded up", and marched away from their home range, as long as 
they stayed together the group was said to be a "drift". Drifts 
usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds, 
but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or 
grass because of a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede. Drifts 
usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 
'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.   The wholesale 
death of cattle as a result of blizzards, and sometimes droughts, over 
a wide range of territory was called a "die-up". Followin' such 
an event there was usually a harvest of "fallen hides", and the 
ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons. Cattle 
were said to be "potted" when "blizzard choked", that is, caught 
in a corner or a draw, or against a "drift fence" durin' a 
storm. Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as 
the "winter kill". When cattle in winter stopped and humped their 
backs up they were said to "bow up". This term was also used by 
the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight, as one cowhand was 
heard to say, "He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm". Cattle 
drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 
'em into prime beef were said to be "double wintered".   Cattle 
brought into a range from a distance were called "immigrants". 
Them new to the country were referred to as "pilgrims". This 
word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle, but later 
was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot. Hereford cattle 
were often called "white faces", or "open-face cattle", 
and the old-time cowman gave the name of "hothouse stock" to them 
newly introduced cattle. Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed, 
they were rarely seen on a ranch, though one might be found now and 
then for the milk supply. The cowboy called this breed of cattle "magpies". 
A "cattaloe" was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and 
cattle. 
"Dry stock" denoted, regardless of age or sex, such bovines 
as were givin' no milk. A "wet herd" was a herd of cattle made 
up entirely of cows, while "wet stuff" referred to cows givin' 
milk. The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a "milk 
pitcher". Cows givin' no milk were knowed as "strippers". 
The terminology of the range, in speakin' of "dry stock" and 
"wet stock", was confusin' to the tenderfoot. The most common reference 
to "wet stock" was with the meanin' that such animals had 
been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their 
rightful owners. The term soon became used and applied to all stolen 
animals. "Mixed herd" meant a herd of mixed sexes, while a "straight 
steer herd" was one composed entirely of steers, and when the 
cowman spoke of "mixed cattle", he meant cattle of various grades, 
ages, and sexes.   In the spring when penned cattle were turned 
out to grass, this was spoken of as "turn-out time", or "put 
to grass". "Shootin' 'em out" was gettin' cattle out of 
a corral onto the range. When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' 
run she was said to "come out a-stoopin'". To stir cattle 
up and get 'em heated and excited was to "mustard the cattle", and 
the act was called "ginnin' 'em 'round", or "chousin' 
'em". After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands 
toward their home range was called "throwin' over". 
A cow rose from the ground rear end first. By the time her hindquarters 
were in a standin' position, her knees were on the ground in a prayin' 
attitude. It was when she was in this position that the name 
"prayin' cow" was suggested to the cowboy. They were said to be 
"on their heads" when grazin'. "On the hoof" was a reference 
to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' 
by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail. Shippin' 
cattle by train was called a "stock run". A general classification 
given grass-fed cattle was "grassers".   When a cowboy 
spoke of "dustin'" a cow, he meant that he throwed dust into her 
eyes. The cow, unlike a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her 
mind on her business when chargin', and a cow "on the prod" or "on 
the peck" was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other 
charges.   The Injun's name for beef was "wohaw", and many 
of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun 
on the trails. The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white 
man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters. Listenin' 
with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted 
"Whoa", "Haw", and "Gee", they thought them words the 
names of the animals, and began callin' cattle "wohaws". Rarely 
did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north 
that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for "wohaw".   "Tailin'" 
was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a 
rope. Any animal could when travelin' fast, be sent heels over head 
by the simple process of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail, 
and givin' the latter a pull to one side. This throwed the animal 
off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders. Though 
the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results, many 
men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle 
horn, supplemented sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave 
of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail. Such tactics were 
resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns, and a thorough 
"tailin'" usually knocked the breath out of a steer, and so dazed 
'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day. It required both 
a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider. When cattle became more 
valuable, ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued, 
at least when the boss was 'round. When the cowboy used the word 
"tailin's", he meant stragglers.   "Bull tailin'" 
was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas. From 
a pen of wild bulls one would be released, and with much yellin' a 
cowhand'd take after 'im. Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed 
his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin' the bull off 
balance, and "bustin'" 'im with terrific force. Rammin' one 
horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called 
"peggin'".   Colors of cattle came in for their special names. 
An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was 
called a "brindle" or "brockle". A "lineback" was an animal 
with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' 
down its back, while a "lobo stripe" was the white, yeller, or 
brown stripe runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic 
of many Spanish cattle. A "mealynose" was a cow or steer of 
the longhorn type, with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest 
of its body 'round the eyes, face, and nose. Such an animal was 
said to be "mealynosed". "Sabinas" was a Spanish word used to 
describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'. 
The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up 
the trail "Sonora reds", while they called all cattle drove up from 
Mexico "yaks", because they came from the Yaqui Injun country, 
or gave 'em the name of "Mexican buckskins". Near the southern 
border, cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black 
with a lineback, with white speckles frequently appearin' on the 
sides and belly, were called "zorrillas". This word was from the 
Spanish, meanin' "polecat". "Yeller bellies" were cattle 
of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color. An 
animal with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished 
and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes used as a 
"marker". Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the 
rustler.   Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was 
found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with 
the uncounted cattle was called a "range count". The countin' 
of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose 
was called a "pasture count". The counters rode through the 
pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted it back 
so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead. This 
method of countin' was usually done at the request, and in the presence, 
of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the 
herd. Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as "cattle paper".
A "book count" was the sellin' of cattle by the books, 
commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes much to the profit of 
the seller. This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the 
"books won't freeze". This became a common byword durin' the 
boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle 
interests. The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper 
by the name of Luke Murrin. His saloon was a meetin' place for 
influential Wyoming cattlemen, and one year durin' a severe blizzard, 
when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces, he said, 
"Cheer up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze". In 
this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' 
custom of buyin' by book count, and created a sayin' which has survived 
through the years. "Range delivery" meant that the buyer, after 
examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation 
for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed to own, 
then rode out and tried to find it.   When a cowhand said that a 
man had "good cow sense", he meant to pay 'im a high compliment. 
No matter by what name cattle were called, there was no denyin' that 
they not only saved Texas from financial ruin, but went far toward 
redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest. #@ 
21 @ SWINGIN' A WIDE LOOP#
THE first use of the word 
"rustler" was as a synonym for "hustler", becomin' an established 
term for any person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in 
any enterprise. Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler, 
and when the order was given to go out and "rustle the hosses", 
it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in. Eventually herdin' 
the hosses was spoken of as "hoss rustlin'", and the wrangler was 
called the "hoss rustler". Later, the word became almost exclusively 
applied to a cow thief, startin' from the days of the maverick 
when cowhands were paid by their employers to "get out and rustle 
a few mavericks". 
IT WAS JOHN who found the lion tracks. He found them near the carcass 
of a zebra that had been killed the night before, and he circled 
once, nose to the ground, hair shooting up along his back, as it did 
when he was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head and bayed, 
and the pack joined in, all heads high, and Jones knew it was a hot 
trail.   He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him 
straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain. This mountain was 
known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about 
two hundred feet, honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub 
and creepers and tall grass. On the south it ended sharply as though 
the lava had been cut off there suddenly.   Kearton and Ulyate 
had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs, and Means 
and Loveless had taken another route, and now, with the discovery 
of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined in, in the 
shadow of the Reef and pointed. Kearton focussed his field glasses.
"That's the Colonel", he said, "But I can't see the 
dogs".   As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef. 
Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front 
of him. The dogs were working a trail- lion? hyena? The pack 
had made a bend to the north, swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton 
and Ulyate could hear them faintly.   Kearton got off and 
tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled 
it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless 
and Means and the rest of the party.   "Not yet", cautioned 
Ulyate.   Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern 
toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly, Old John 
with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others. There 
was Sounder, too, also a veteran of the North Rim, and Rastus and 
the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London 
pound, and Simba, a terrier **h. A motley pack, chosen for effectiveness, 
not beauty. Jones was galloping close behind them leaning 
down, cheering them on.   "Light it"! Ulyate said, and Kearton 
touched a match to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked 
out. He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column of smoke rose.
"That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we 
are".   Two quick shots sounded. Then there was a chorus of 
wild barking and baying. Then the heavy roar of a lion.   Kearton 
and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound. 
It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away. At the 
base of the rocky hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot. 
The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers and bushes, so 
thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called, 
Ulyate answered from ten feet away. Nice country to meet a lion in 
face to face. Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the 
barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion, till they 
came, out of breath, to the crest, and peering through the branches of 
a bush, this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently (and actually 
had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside, sitting calmly on 
his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness, who was crouched 
on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the 
dogs whirled around her.   Ulyate drew back with a start, and put 
finger to lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her 
off, "The dogs have got her bayed **h. She's just the other side 
of that bush"! And when they had drawn back a step he added: 
"Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her. Why she doesn't 
charge him, I don't know. And he hasn't even got a knife on 
him. He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground **h. Careful, 
don't disturb her". ##
Jones had been about a hundred 
and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the 
Reef. She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when 
she saw him she rose to full height and roared, opening her mouth wide, 
lashing her tail, and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in 
irritation, as much as to say: "How dare you disturb me in my sacred 
precinct"?   Intuition told him, however, that she was tired 
and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge, yet. He 
moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her, being careful, because 
he knew the female is less predictable than the male. (In the graveyard 
at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game 
hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso. 
Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed by lions, and eleven out 
of the seventeen by lionesses.) She snarled terribly but intuition 
told 
him, again, that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her 
attention was distracted by the dogs. He threw the lasso. It was falling 
over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front 
of her on the rock. Even then, if she took one step forward he could 
catch her. But John nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end 
was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona no matter- and she 
changed ends and took a swipe at John, but he ducked back.   Jones 
then recoiled his rope and threw again, this time hitting her on 
the back but failing to encircle her. She whirled and faced him, roaring 
terribly, and Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand 
why she did not charge and obliterate him, because he wouldn't 
have much of a chance of getting away, in that thick growth, but she 
seemed just a trace uncertain; while Jones, on the other hand, appeared 
perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.
From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature 
on the back of another creature, lashing out with its long thin paw, 
very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with. But 
now she sank lower to the rock. Her roar changed to a growl. Her 
tail 
no longer lashed. Although she appeared more subdued and defeated, 
Jones knew she was growing more dangerous. She was rested and could 
mount a charge. Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched, 
and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet. 
At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing through the undergrowth 
with their horses, and distracted her, and she ran off a short 
distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks. The dogs followed 
her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.   "We've 
got to get her out of there"! Jones yelled, "or she'll 
kill 'em all. Bring me the firecrackers".   For such an 
emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of 
their equipment. Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice, and the 
lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.   "Ain't she 
a beauty, though"? called out Means as she ran.   "Don't 
you go a step nearer her than I do", Jones warned, "and if 
you do, go at a run so you'll have momentum"!   For two hours 
they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of 
the Reef, trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get 
a good throw. But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore 
away. It was hot. The dogs were tired. The men were tired too. It 
was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again. And the sun was 
beginning to go down. If dark came they would lose her.   "I'll 
get a pole", Jones said finally, "and I'll poke a noose 
over her 
head"!   At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like 
aperture halfway down the Reef. Ulyate made no comment but his face 
showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles, 
and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago, not the gentler 
ones of today, and this one was angry, with good reason. Loveless, 
too, objected. "It won't work, Colonel".   "Just the 
same we'll try it".   But without waiting for them to try it, 
she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain.
John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out 
behind, many of them trailing blood. John himself was bruised and 
clawed from head to tail, but he was in this fight to the finish, running 
almost as strongly now as in the morning.   She took refuge 
on a tongue of land extending into a gully, crouched at the base of a 
thorn tree, and waited for them to come up. She had chosen the spot well. 
With the gully on three sides, she could be approached only along 
the tongue of land. "Careful, now", Jones warned.   Means 
tried her first. Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding, 
edging closer, watching for a chance to throw, but ready to spin and 
run, rope whining about his head, horse edging tensely under him, but 
the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close 
proximity of the lion. They tell you horses go crazy at the sight 
or smell of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.   Means edged 
closer. She snarled warningly. Means spit and edged on. Again she 
snarled, and again he edged. The pony was sidewise to her. With a whirling 
jump, it could get into gear **h. However nothing on four legs 
was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance, unless 
it was a cheetah.   She charged. Means spun and spurred. For thirty 
yards she gained rapidly. She was closing and within one more bound 
would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay, but- and 
here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they 
were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound. Means held 
steady one jump ahead of her. Then gradually he began to pull away. 
A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion, from a standing start. 
Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means **h. 
Of course the factor of head start made all the difference. How much 
head start? No one knew exactly. That was the whole question. 
Enough, was the answer.   The lioness quickly changed front, when 
she saw she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones. As she had 
done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but then Baldy began 
to draw away. Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the 
determining point.   When Jones too drew away, she returned to 
a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched low 
and waited as before. This new position, however, gave the ropers a 
better chance. There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and 
throw as you went. So: Means edged around on the north side of her, 
Jones moved in from the south. Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted 
her attention. He succeeded almost too well, because once she 
rose as if to charge, and he half wheeled his horse- he was within 
fifty feet- but she sank back.   From behind her Means shot 
forward at a run. Kearton began shouting, "Wait, wait- the camera's 
jammed"! But Means kept on. He raced by within twenty feet 
of her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck is short and 
thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off. 
The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was 
once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies. But the time 
came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was 
looked upon as deficient in its essential life. The Christian education 
of children, too, was once hardly more than a sideshow, but the day 
came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church 
school was thought of as failing in its duty.   The most serious 
weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally 
regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination 
and a few interdenominational executives. Most pastors and laymen, 
even though they believe it to be important, assume that the ecumenical 
movement lies outside the province of their parishes. They may 
even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the 
"ecclesiastical Rover Boys", as someone has dubbed them, who like 
to go to national and international assemblies, and have expense accounts 
that permit them to do so.   As long as this point of view 
prevails, the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt. The next 
stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community. 
Progress will take place far less through what is done in any 
"summit conference" of the National Council or the World Council, 
or even in offices of the denominational boards, than through what 
happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors. 
The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping 
congregations of different traditions exist side by side. Until they 
see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their 
own attitudes, programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable 
aspect of unreality. As things now stand, there is a grievous disparity 
between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings 
and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main 
Street in the nation. 
#THE ECUMENICAL CONGREGATION#
The crux 
of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation 
between congregations in the same community. The decisive question 
is what happens <within> each congregation and, finally, in the 
minds and hearts of the individual members. It is here that the local 
and ecumenical must meet. It is here that the ecumenical must become 
local and the local become ecumenical.   It has become almost 
trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be "carried down to the 
grass roots". This way of describing the matter is unfortunate. 
It implies two misconceptions. One is that whatever is ecumenical has 
to do with some over-all organization at "the top" and needs only 
to be understood at the so-called "lower levels". The truth, however, 
is that the ecumenical church <is> just the local church in its 
own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God 
throughout the world. The other misconception is that our ecumenical 
problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide 
extension and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended 
by many national leaders, can be communicated to all congregations. 
However needed this may be, the fundamental problem is not information 
but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ 
in the world.   The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational 
polity, is always the congregation. It is hardly possible 
to emphasize this too much. Most people do not realize that the congregation, 
as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face, personally 
sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience 
in daily relationships with one another, is unique. The idea that it 
is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken. The Jewish synagogue 
affords a parallel to the Christian congregation, but Hinduism, 
Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, although they 
have sacred scriptures, priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of 
prayer, do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and 
love. Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an 
altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with 
a distinctive kind of fellowship.   How far the fellowship in most 
local churches falls below what the New Testament means by <koinonia!> 
What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more 
than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind 
of people one likes. The <koinonia> of Acts and of the Epistles 
means sharing in a common relation to Christ. It is an experience of 
a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate 
indwelling of Christ in His people. As Dietrich Bonho^ffer puts 
it, "Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ 
has done to both of us". This may mean having fellowship in the church 
with people with whom, on the level of merely human agreeableness, 
we might prefer not to have any association at all. There is a vast 
difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament 
describes and the community of congeniality found in the average 
church building.   Whenever a congregation really sees itself 
as a unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with the whole 
Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world, a necessary 
foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid. The 
antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists. The 
local and the ecumenical are one.   Of course, the perspective 
of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the 
People of God will always be different from the perspective of those 
who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a 
particular place. Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related 
to the other. Neither is adequate if it stands alone. Our difficulty 
arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other. And this is what 
all too often happens. 
#DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES#
A little parable 
illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor 
Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War. With great 
difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew 
his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World 
Council of Churches. When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles, 
his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new 
ones. They were bifocals. He often spoke of them as his "ecumenical" 
glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is 
required in the church. It is, he said, a bifocal vision, which can 
see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right 
relation to both.   As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical 
tend to compete with each other. On the one hand, there are 
ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter 
with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church 
is doing in their own town. They do not escape the pitfall into which 
Charles Dickens pictured Mrs& Jellyby as falling. Her concern 
for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite 
forgot and neglected her son Peepy! Likewise, the ecumenist may become 
so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian 
state in East Germany, the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary 
China, and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South 
Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its 
unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service 
and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.
On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering 
to the intimate, personal needs of individuals in his congregation 
that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social 
responsibility and world mission. As a result, they go on thinking 
of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction, only 
in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families. 
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of 
the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual 
concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the 
members. The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or 
the world.   The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the 
parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable 
suburbs. It is eminently successful according to all conventional 
standards. It is growing in numbers. Its people are agreeable 
friends. It has a beautiful edifice. Its preaching and its music give 
refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain. It 
provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled. It helps children 
grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible. It draws 
young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the 
church from generation to generation. And it is easy for the ecumenical 
enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.   But what 
is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians 
in the world? All too often its conception of parish ministry 
and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation 
to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind. 
It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with 
the mind of Christ. It is not helping them face the moral crisis 
involved in the use of nuclear energy. It is not making them sensitive 
to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial 
life. It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship 
means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world 
to economically underdeveloped peoples. It is not developing an awareness 
of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young 
churches emerge in Asia and Africa.   To put it bluntly, many 
a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want. 
It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility 
in relation to the world. We shall not make a decisive advance 
in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not 
merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness 
and mission to the world.   There is a humorous but revealing 
story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted 
to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant 
community. He built a school and a library, then a recreation center 
and an inn. Desiring to fill the only remaining lack, he selected 
the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting 
it. A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired, "Do 
you belong to this church, Mr& Rancher"? "Why, no, ma'am", 
he replied, "this church belongs to me"! The story reflects 
the way too many people feel. As long as the congregation regards 
the church as "our" church, or the minister thinks of it as "my" 
church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant 
advance. There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs 
not to us but to Christ, and that it is His purpose, not our own interests 
and preferences, that determines what it is to be and do. 
#LOCAL 
EMBODIMENT OF THE WHOLE#
A local church which conceives its function 
to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and 
concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an 
extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church. It would 
doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical 
it is really failing to be the Church of Christ.   Yet the 
truth, according to the New Testament, is that every local church 
has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in 
that particular place. 
Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match 
the boys from the neighboring farms; and buggies and wagons and chugging 
Fords kept gathering all morning, until the edges of the field 
were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field 
to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was a formidable looking 
young man with the only baseball cap.   This was a bitterly 
fought game, carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight, with no 
friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness 
that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls 
that went into the crowd. Every pitch in the game brought forth 
a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors 
dropped (and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from 
drink, they dropped many) called forth yelps of derision.   At 
one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting 
as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in 
the kidneys, he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled 
over whether the ball was "dead" or the base runners were 
free to score.   This was typical of such games, which were earnestly 
played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of 
good fellowship. When the visitors, after losing this game, rode along 
the village streets toward home, the youngsters who could keep abreast 
of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, "You bunch of 
hay-shakers! G'ahn back home! You hay-shakers"!   Baseball 
was surely the national game in those days, even though professional 
baseball may have been merely a business. Radio broadcasts had 
not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home, 
in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or three trips to the 
city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or 
the Red Sox.   Young men in school could look forward to playing 
ball for money in a dozen different places, even if they failed to 
make the major leagues. Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might 
find a payday awaiting him in the Three ~I League, or the Pony 
League, or the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League, 
if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere. 
Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams, 
sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores, 
that played two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually in 
the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan audience who 
did not begrudge a quarter each, or even more, to be dropped into a hat 
when the game was half over.   Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's 
hero, and everyone knew him, even though relatively few ever 
saw him play ball. His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes 
in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life. As the twenties grew 
older, and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more 
and more people daily in the doings of the professionals, the great 
hitters (always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the game so that pitchers 
were nearly of no account. Boys no longer bothered learning to 
bunt and even school kids scorned to "choke up" on a bat as Willie 
Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.   Other 
hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared 
to dream of matching Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his 
friends, or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him (Leo 
was the name of the ball player he liked the least) and who called most 
of the world "Kid". Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster, 
and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs. But the nickname never 
stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in "color"- which is sometimes 
a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field. Ruth 
was a delinquent boy still, but he was in every way a great ball 
player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone 
to do it.   A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities, 
with the encouragement of the press, so that they might 
see their names in big black print, along with Daddy Browning's, 
Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince of Wales'. One 
who, for a time, succeeded 
best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles 
Arthur Shires, who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the 
Great, or The Great Shires. It was his brag that he could beat 
everybody at anything, but especially at fighting, and he once took on 
the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists. 
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond; 
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles 
in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First 
Baseman for some forgotten reason. (This made a sportswriter named 
Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated 
his manager.) The sorry fact about this young man, who was barely 
of age when he broke into major-league baseball, was that he really 
was a better ball player than he was given credit for being- never so 
good as he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates, but a 
good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate 
on his skills or cut up in public.   In his minor way Charles 
Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was, for 
he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these 
Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers. 
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down; 
or who ingested strange objects, like live fish; or who undertook 
to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with or without 
a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without 
pausing for breath. One young man, exhilarated to the point of insanity 
by liquor and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect 
swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army 
football game, landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below, 
and died at once.   But the twenties were not all insanity and 
a striving after recognition. The business of baseball began to prosper 
along with other entertainments, and performers- thanks partly to 
George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his 
salary higher and higher- prospered too. While fifty years before, 
Albert Goodwill Spalding, secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of 
the National League, could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo 
club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball 
game in August, in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium 
might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate. And 
while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox- all of them 
top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy Charles 
Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five 
hundred dollars a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars, 
twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars a season.
The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New 
York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club 
by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins. Boston fans sometimes 
liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the 
great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox- sold to millionaires 
Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most 
trifling desire. Ruth himself, still owning his farm in Massachusetts 
and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed 
his round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade down from Fenway 
Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays, Leslie "Joe" Bush, 
Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam Jones, catcher Wally Schang, 
third baseman Joe Dugan (who completed the "playboy trio" of 
Ruth, Dugan, and Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott. By 1926, when 
the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of these were 
left but they still shone brightest, even beside able and agile rookies 
like Tony Lazzeri (who managed never to have one of his epileptic 
fits on the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras, and 
gray-thatched Earl Combs. The deeds of this team, through two seasons 
and in the two World's Series that followed, have been written 
and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said. But there 
is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in 
the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to 
recall. Babe Ruth, as he always did in the Stadium, played right field 
to avoid having the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather 
mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St& Louis Cardinals, 
knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the 
permanent stands and the wooden bleachers, where Ruth could not reach 
it. The ball lay there, shining white on the grass in view of nearly 
every fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration, charged 
about the small patch of ground screaming, "Where's the -ing 
ball"? But, as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over, 
"not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me", so little Tommy 
ran all the way home.   The ordinary man and woman, however, saw 
little of the great professional games of those Golden Days, or of 
any other sporting event for that matter. Promoters always hastened 
to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators, 
and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in 
with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest 
of any importance. Radio broadcasts, however- now that even plain 
people could afford "loud speakers" on their sets- held old 
fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones, chiefly women, 
who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition, 
became first inured, then attracted, then addicted to the long 
afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on 
weekends the announcer was silenced, and fans must needs drive to the 
city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring. 
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well 
as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies, some of which began 
to offer special excursion rates, including seats at the park, just 
as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new. 
While women had always attended ball games in small numbers (it was the 
part of a "dead game sport" in the early years of the twentieth 
century to be taken out to the ball park and to root, root, root for 
the home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom, unable even to 
read the scoreboard, which sometimes seemed to indicate that one 
team 
led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and 
fifty-one. The questions women asked at baseball games were standard 
grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women automobile drivers; 
for every grown man (except a few who were always suspected of 
being shy on virility) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just 
as every male American in this era liked to imagine (or pretend) that 
he could fight with his fists. And women were not expected to know 
that the pitcher was trying <not> to let the batter hit the ball.
Radio, however, so increased the interest of women in the game 
that it was hardly necessary even to have "Ladies' Days" any longer 
to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home. 
Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where 
they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice 
stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.
The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative, 
despite the baseball jargon, that girls and women could begin to 
store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics 
that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their 
lessons in school. 
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores 
will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the "ideal", 
and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for 
preserving the ideal.   Our discussion of this involves using 
Erik Erikson's schema of "identity <vs&> identity diffusion" 
as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto 
the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers 
from whose case histories we quoted earlier. Our discussion does not 
utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended 
to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying 
unwed mothers. We hope thereby to emphasize that, from a psychological 
standpoint, the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous 
long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy 
through adolescence.   Hypothesizing a series of developmental 
stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old 
age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series 
of identity crises. The successful and positive resolution of these 
crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during 
adolescence, the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity 
crisis depend, to a considerable degree, on his already having 
resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy, 
childhood, and early adolescence. Within Erikson's schema, the 
adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case, her unwed motherhood- 
reflects her "identity diffusion", or her inability to resolve 
these various identity crises positively.   <The adolescent 
experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs& time diffusion>. 
Time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and 
to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range 
objectives- is more easily developed if, from infancy on, the individual 
has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which 
she lives. Erikson has noted that, unless this trust developed early, 
the time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and temporarily, 
by all adolescents (as a result of their remembering the more immediate 
gratification of wants during childhood, while not yet having fully 
accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood) may develop 
into a more permanent sense of time diffusion. Experience of this time 
diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate 
urgency to act immediately.   These polar extremes in time 
diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported 
in earlier chapters. Some of these mothers, apparently feeling a 
desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the moment, commitments, in love 
and sex, that would have life-long consequences. Others displayed 
utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future. 
For many of these unwed mothers, the data on their family life 
and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources 
of their 
basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in 
general.   However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's 
failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood 
need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of 
identity diffusion in his (or her) adolescence. And, as shown in Chapter 
/6,, some ~SNP females originally developed such trust only 
during their adolescence, through the aid of, and their identification 
with, alter-parents. In the specific case of time diffusion, we 
must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust 
<when it is combined with> the inevitable time crisis experienced by 
most (if not all) adolescents in our society, and with the failure of 
the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.
<The adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty 
vs& an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation 
vs& negative identity>. A sense of self-certainty and the freedom 
to experiment with different roles, or confidence in one's own unique 
behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity, is more easily 
developed during adolescence if, during early childhood, the individual 
was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some 
autonomy.   However, if the child has been constantly surrounded, 
during nursery and early school age, by peer groups; inculcated 
with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed 
little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence 
her normal degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with 
whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable, will be compounded. 
Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions 
and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence 
are the manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been indoctrinated 
in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt, for failing to behave 
in a manner acceptable to, and judged by, the performance of her nursery- 
and elementary-school peer friends. To be different is to invite 
shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's 
parents, who already consider one different and difficult to understand, 
than by one's peers, who are also experiencing a similar groping 
for and denial of adult status.   The attitudes of some unwed 
mothers quoted in Chapter /2,, revealed both considerable preoccupation 
with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty. 
Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable 
means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but 
very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need 
to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and 
with one's self.   <Another identity crisis confronting the 
adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs& work-paralysis>. 
The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise 
the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends 
on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy, initiative, and 
self-discipline during childhood. The developmental process involves 
the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement 
resulting from having completed tasks, having kept commitments, 
and having created something (however small or simple- even a doll 
dress of one's own design rather than in the design "it ought 
to be"). These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty 
that the adolescent needs, for experimenting with many roles, and 
for the <freedom to fail sometimes> in the process of exploring and 
discovering her skills and abilities.   If she has not had such 
experiences, the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will 
be compounded. She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted 
with present and future alternatives- e&g&, whether to prepare 
primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker; whether 
to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself 
while attending school; whether to pursue a college education or a 
job after high school; and whether to attend this or that college and 
to follow this or that course of study. Erikson has noted that, as 
this indecision mounts, it may result in a "paralysis of workmanship". 
This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and 
never completing- many jobs, tasks, and courses of study; and in 
the fact that she bases her decisions about work, college, carreer, and 
studies on what others are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity 
with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes. The absence, 
during her childhood and early adolescence, of experiences in developing 
the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences 
that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement- 
and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy 
and initiative in play and expression, both tend in her adolescence 
to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally 
in experimenting.   The comments made by some unwed mothers 
(quoted in Chapter /2,) reflect this paralysis of workmanship. They 
attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions 
others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available, 
convenient, and paid reasonably. These things both express and, 
at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity diffusion 
in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and 
self-certainty. As their identity diffusion increased, they became more 
susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs. These 
affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities 
containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship, 
no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.   Childhood 
experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context 
of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance 
for the prevention of illegitimacy. The excerpts from case histories 
presented above confirm this significance, though through different 
facets of experience. For example, some unwed mothers had had no work 
experiences, household chores, and responsibilities during childhood 
and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours 
in searching for something exciting and diverting. Sex was both. On 
the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility 
imposed on them at an early age, and had thus had so little freedom 
or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work 
and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped 
and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden 
sexual behavior.   <The adolescent also faces the identity 
crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs& diffusion 
of ideals>. In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations 
for the prevention of illegitimacy, we shall again superimpose 
Erikson's concept on our data.   Adolescents have a much-discussed 
tendency to polarize ideas and values, to perceive things as 
"either-or", black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively 
unimportant. This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in the 
literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents. Erikson 
has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily 
resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly 
changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood. 
It provides identification- with an idea, a value, a cause that 
cuts through, or even transcends, the multiple and ambivalent identities 
of their passage from child to adult, and permits their forceful 
and overt expression of emotion.   The positive development, during 
adolescence, of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with 
increasing independence, and to identify overtly either with or against 
given ideas, values, and practices, depends to a considerable degree 
on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy, 
initiative, and self-certainty. Most adolescents have some ideological 
diffusion at various developmental stages, as they experience a proliferation 
of ideas and values. The diffusion is most pronounced and 
most likely to become fixed, however, in those who have had no or very 
minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could 
have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources 
of developing self-certainty.   A pronounced ideological 
diffusion- i&e&, inability to <identify independently> with given 
ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways. For example, 
it is evinced by the adolescent (or adult) whose beliefs and actions 
represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior 
patterns of others, rather than his inner conviction and choice. 
It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and 
behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide 
with those of the individual or group present and most important 
at the moment. In another sense, it is represented in the arguments 
of the "true believers" who seek to disprove the validity of all 
other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.
The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological 
diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's inability to <identify 
independently> with a given value system or behavior pattern, and 
her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility 
for her sexual behavior. For example, the unwed mothers expressed 
their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly "what 
it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly". 
They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital 
sexual intercourse. They condemned the movie script writers for implying 
that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating. They criticized parents 
for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong; 
and they censured parents who "never disciplined and were too permissive" 
or who "never explained how easy it was to get pregnant".
In the adult world, there are a number of rather general and 
diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the 
adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis. 
For example, some contemporary writing tends to fuse the "good 
guys" and the "bad guys", to portray the weak people as heroes and 
weakness as a virtue, and to explain (or even justify) asocial behavior 
by attributing it to deterministic psychological, familial, and social 
experiences. 
In the final accounting, these would have augmented the bill for both 
sides. An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.
Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation, 
which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly contributed to constructive 
changes in legal procedure. The duration and other circumstances 
of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of 
patent infringement actions. The suit, as we have seen, came before 
the courts when patent attorneys, inventors, and laymen were making mounting 
demands for reforms in the American patent system. Chief among 
the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures 
in equity.   In a long and angry footnote to his opinion, 
Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism. 
"It is a duty", said Hough, "not to let pass this opportunity 
of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony 
in Equity, current in this circuit (and probably others), excused 
if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court, especially to 
be found in patent causes, and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation. 
As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition, 
rather than <viva voce> before an authoritative judicial officer, 
I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged, and expensive 
prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity". Observing 
that "reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible 
examples", Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing 
procedures. He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case 
record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous 
squabbles over minor matters; the "objections stated at outrageous 
length"; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts, "uncalled 
for and 
unjustifiable, from the retort discourteous to the lie direct".
The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was 
"a striking (though not singular) example", concluded Hough, "will 
remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial 
officer present, and responsible for the maintenance of discipline, 
and the reception or exclusion of testimony".   Not least 
among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment 
were those who had participated in the Selden suit. William A& 
Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under 
rules of evidence, the testimony would have been completed in sixty 
days instead of five years. Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for 
reform, inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a "horrible 
example". Its costive deliberations were likened to those of 
the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in 
<Bleak House>.   Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism, 
did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects. But 
he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried. In a detailed 
letter published in the <Scientific American> in 1912, he 
remarked that "loose statements" about the case showed scant understanding 
of the facts. The suit, although commonly designated as a single 
action, actually embraced five cases. Parker insisted that the size 
of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable 
duplication of testimony.   In a private communication written 
in 1911, Parker had been more to the point. Noting the complaints 
of inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted that some 
of the strictures "were fairly well founded", but he added that under 
existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group 
of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent. The 
vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit, as well as the 
complex character of the automotive art, encouraged both sides to exploit 
"every possible chance" for or against the patent, said Parker. 
"This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases, and 
of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the 
record beyond what ordinarily would occur".   Parker listed the 
remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony. 
The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's 
plea for reform. Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate 
or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court 
who had no authority to limit testimony. The taking of depositions, 
he suggested, should be placed under a special court examiner empowered 
to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial 
testimony. "I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power 
existed and this course [been] pursued, it would have shortened 
the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of 
the other witnesses thereto more than that".   In the end Hough's 
acidulous protest, which Parker called the "now somewhat famous 
note on this 'Selden' case", did not go unheeded. In 1912 
the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity 
which became effective on February 1, 1913. The revised procedure 
was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform. Under the new rules, testimony 
is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary 
character. Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent 
prolixity, limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement suits. 
One of the A&L&A&M& lawyers observed that if the Selden 
case had been tried under this simplified procedure, the testimony 
which filled more than a score of volumes, "at a minimum cost of $1 
a page for publication alone, could have been contained in one volume". 
While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive 
forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums 
of money. There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme 
Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit.

Even 
before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the A&L&A&M& 
was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade, the direct lineal 
ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association. 
The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A&L&A&M& 
were more representative, for they never adopted a policy of exclusion. 
Nevertheless, it is from the Selden organization that the industry 
inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests 
of the trade. One of the chief features of this community of interest 
is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone 
in the development of American industrial cooperation. Its origin 
lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath.   From 
the earliest days of the motor car industry, before the A&L&A&M& 
was established, patent infringement loomed as a serious and 
vexing problem. Many patent contests were waged over automobile components 
and accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball bearings, 
license brackets, and electric horns. The fluidity and momentum of 
the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims. As 
early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with 
the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers. 
This scheme failed, and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement 
suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest 
in 1912.   In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing 
scheme adopted by the A&L&A&M& at its founding proved 
to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant 
litigation. The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty 
eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A&L&A&M& 
patent pool (although it did not protect them against outside 
actions) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive 
technology. One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition 
upon the withholding of patent rights among A&L&A&M& members. 
Within its limits, this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics 
of a cross-licensing agreement. Its positive features 
outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly. 
Since the A&L&A&M& holdings embraced only about twenty-five 
per cent of motor vehicle patents, the denial of rights to independent 
companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors 
of the industry. The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding 
gear transmission were held by the A&L&A&M& pool. But Henry 
Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model ~T and earlier 
cars and, in 1905, as a precautionary measure, took out a license 
from the man who claimed to be its inventor.   For those affiliated 
with it, the A&L&A&M& pool was a haven from the infringement 
actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting 
intensity after 1900. By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases, 
many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions. 
It was commonplace for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers 
to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their 
daily mail. "Purely from the business man's standpoint and without 
regard to the lawyer's view", commented a trade journal, "the 
matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing 
some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents 
are to become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple beneficient 
protection devices for encouraging inventive creation".
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain 
prospect of legal complications. One manufacturer who held an allegedly 
basic patent said: "I would readily put over $50,000 into the 
manufacture of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would enter 
immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would 
eat up all our profits". The prevailing view in the industry was 
summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee: 
"The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions, 
including delays surrounding legal disputes, particularly in patent 
litigation, are items of industrial burden which must be written 
large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste".
By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping 
constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical 
information. At this point Charles C& Hanch, long an advocate 
of patent peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents committee 
of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, successor 
to the Automobile Board of Trade. Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke 
+ Marmon Company, an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling 
machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904. He had 
first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety 
per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's. 
Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry, 
Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading 
A&L&A&M& members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan. 
The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but Hanch 
did not abandon his scheme.   After the demise of the A&L&A&M&, 
the time was propitious for establishing such a pool. 
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal 
interchange of patents. "It is a much easier course to agree to 
let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned", said 
a trade authority, "than to continue the costly effort of straightening 
the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system, 
which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day".
With the other members of the patents committee- Wilfred C& Leland, 
Howard E& Coffin, Windsor T& White, and W& H& 
Vandervoort- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential 
feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution. The 
plan was supported by Frederick P& Fish, counsel for the National 
Automobile Chamber of Commerce. It will be recalled that in his 
summation for the A&L&A&M& before Judge Hough, Fish had 
condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial 
community. He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used 
their patents solely for nuisance value. "My personal view is that 
not one patented invention in ten is worth making", he later told 
a Congressional committee. The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed 
the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.
Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement became 
effective in 1915. It remained in force for ten years and has been 
renewed at five-year intervals since 1925. 
A little farther along the road you come to the {Church of Santa 
Sabina,} called the "Pearl of the Aventine". Continue another 
hundred yards to the {Piazza of the Knights of Malta.} On the 
wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments. 
The massive {gate} of the Maltese villa affords one of 
the most extraordinary views in Rome. If you look through the keyhole, 
you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome 
of St& Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via di Santa Sabina and 
turn right on the {Via di S& Alessio,} a street lined with 
stately homes. Oleanders, cypress, and palms in the spacious gardens 
add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section. Turn 
left a block or so before the street ends, and then turn right down 
the Via di Santa Prisca to the {Viale Aventino.} Here you can 
pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city. 
#THE RENAISSANCE CITY#
_TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_ 
These two walks take you through the {heart of Rome.} You will 
walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed in by massive <palazzi>. 
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed, 
a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish 
Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied places, 
both interesting and beautiful, you will become aware of the many 
different civilizations Rome has lived through, and in particular, get 
a feel of Renaissance Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed 
the Eternal City.   Start on the Via d& Teatro di Marcello 
at the foot of the {Capitoline Hill.} The majestic circular 
tiers of stone of the {Theatre of Marcellus} give you some idea 
of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B&C&. 
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days. 
Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled 
his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.   Wander past 
the three superb {Columns of Apollo} by the arches of the theatre. 
The remains of the {Portico of Octavia} are now in front of 
you. Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di 
Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo. 
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli, 
then proceed along the Via dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei. Here 
is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome, the {Fontana delle 
Tartarughe} or {"Fountain of the Tortoises".} It's typical 
of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find 
such an artistic work in the center of a little square. Stand here 
for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths, 
each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head 
of a dolphin. The figures have been executed so skillfully that one 
senses a great feeling of life and movement.   Opposite is the 
{Palazzo Mattei,} one of Rome's oldest palaces, now the headquarters 
of the {Italo-American Association.} Go inside for a closer 
look at a Renaissance palace. In the first courtyard there are 
some fine bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series of delightful 
terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall. The {Palazzo 
Caetani,} still inhabited by the Caetani family, adjoins the Palazzo 
Mattei.   Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross 
the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the {Piazza B& 
Cairoli,} where you should look in at the {Church of San Carlo 
ai Catinari} to see the frescoes on the ceiling. Follow the colorful 
and busy Via d& Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so. Now turn 
left at the Via dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini. 
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro will 
bring you to the {Palazzo Spada,} built in 1540 and now occupied 
by the {Council of State.} Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, 
and Rubens are on display (open 9:30-4:00).   Before you enter 
the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's facade. The great architect 
also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which 
connects the two courts. The large statue on the first floor is believed 
to be the {statue of Pompey} at the base of which Julius Caesar 
was stabbed to death (if so, the statue once stood in the senate 
house). (This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)
By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard Borromini's 
unusual and fascinating trick in perspective. When you stand before 
the barrel-vaulted {colonnade} you have the impression that the statue 
at 
the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few 
feet away. The sense of perspective has been created by designing the 
length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade 
are much shorter than those in front. The gardens of the <palazzo,> 
shaded by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard 
is magnificently decorated.   From the Palazzo Spada you continue 
another block along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti 
to the imposing {Palazzo Farnese,} begun in 1514 and considered 
by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo was the most distinguished 
of several noted architects who helped design it. Today it 
is occupied by the {French Embassy.} Its lovely seventeenth-century 
ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously 
high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays 
(11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris 
and Rome designed by Lurcat.   Directly in front of the palace 
along the Via d& Baullari you will come to the {Campo di Fiori,} 
the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance 
Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit, 
vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the Via d& Baullari to 
the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred 
yards to the {Church of Sant' Andrea della Valle.} As you 
approach the church on the Via d& Baullari you are passing within 
yards of the remains of the {Roman Theatre of Pompey,} near which 
is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated. 
The dome of the church is, outside of {St& Peter's,} 
one of the largest in Rome. Opera lovers will be interested to learn 
that this church was the scene for the first act of <Tosca>.
At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele /2,, 
walk along the Corso del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards, 
then turn left on the Via dei Canestrani to enter the splendid {Piazza 
Navona,} one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.   Your 
first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains, 
its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored 
buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly 
welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have 
followed since starting this walk.   The site of the oblong 
piazza is {Domitian's ancient stadium,} which was probably used 
for horse and chariot races. For centuries it was the location of historic 
festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth to 
the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in 
the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated 
square in their carriages.   Giovanni Bernini's {"Fountain 
of the Rivers",} in the center of the piazza, is built around 
a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes 
and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner, denoting four 
great rivers from different continents- the Danube, the Ganges, the 
Nile, and the Plate. The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, 
perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure 
from her sight the baroque facade of the {Church of Sant' Agnese 
in Agone}, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini. 
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can 
sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch the fountains in the square. The 
scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about 
Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.
Take the Via di S& Agnese in Agone, next to the church 
and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about 
two hundred yards to reach the beautiful {Church of Santa Maria della 
Pace.} Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael 
and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's cloisters 
are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations.   Now 
return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the 
Corsia Agonale; in a moment cross the Corso del Rinascimento. 
In front of you is the {Palazzo Madama,} once belonging to the 
Medici and now the {Italian Senate.} Walk by the side of the 
palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come 
to the {Piazza della Rotonda.} You are now facing the {Pantheon,} 
the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the 
days of ancient Rome.   This circular edifice, constructed by 
Agrippa in B&C& 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor 
Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century. 
As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the 
Temple of Isis, you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian 
columns.   The Pantheon's interior, still in its original 
form, is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its {rotunda} 
forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from 
the floor to the ceiling. The only means of interior light is the 
twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous {dome.} Standing 
before the tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance, when 
shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple, you are 
once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of 
Rome.   As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to 
the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to {Sant' Ignazio,} 
one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city. (Along the way 
there, about one hundred yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant, 
{La Sacrestia,} where you can have the best pizza in Rome.) 
The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church 
seems like a stage set. This is one of the most charming little 
squares in this part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in 
front of the church) will bring you to the {Stock Exchange} in 
the old {Temple of Neptune.} A few yards farther, on the Via 
dei Bergamaschi, is the {Piazza Colonna.} The great column from 
which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius.   You are now at the {Corso,} though narrow, one 
of Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here in the Middle 
Ages.   If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have 
the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso 
for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings- 
mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the 
{Palazzo Doria} (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00-1:00). 
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where 
the family still lives.   Otherwise, cross over the Corso and 
walk a block or so to the left. You will come to {Alemagna,} a 
delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly 
noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries. 
Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the 
place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome. _TO THE SPANISH 
STEPS_ The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken 
after lunch, so that you will reach the {Pincian Hill} when 
the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best. 
Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church 
member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale 
to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality. I myself 
have witnessed and endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers 
also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And this is not, 
perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward 
black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they 
are nearly all downtown.)   It is hard, on the other hand, to blame 
the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably 
innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves. 
He, too, believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended 
when they are not taken for the deed. He has never, himself, done 
anything for which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is 
facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly see him dead, and he 
knows it. There is no way for him not to know it: there are few things 
under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt 
and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore, like 
an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely 
what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes. 
And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company: 
the people who are watching him know why, too. Any street meeting, 
sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as 
its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white 
domination. And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and 
jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination. The white policeman 
standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center 
of the revolution now occurring in the world. He is not prepared 
for it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much more to the 
point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the 
black people around him. Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard 
grain of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid observing 
that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of 
children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children. He 
knows that he certainly does not want <his> children living this 
way. He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into 
a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature. He becomes more 
callous, the population becomes more hostile, the situation grows 
more tense, and the police force is increased. One day, to everyone's 
astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything 
blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials, 
speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding 
to know what happened. What happened is that Negroes want to 
be treated like men.   <Negroes want to be treated like men:> 
a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words. 
People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud, 
and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems 
to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic 
paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on 
the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe to a very well-known 
American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South. 
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me 
in perfect innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South 
move North"? I tried to explain what <has> happened, unfailingly, 
whenever a significant body of Negroes move North. They do not 
escape Jim Crow: they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly 
variety. They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side; 
they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure 
within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion 
is always violent. White people hold the line as long as they can, 
and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical 
violence. But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from 
the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto. The white 
people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make 
a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but 
dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood 
turns into a "turf". This is precisely what happened when the Puerto 
Ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused 
is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.
Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury. They seem 
to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil 
War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going 
on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it; and 
that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what 
is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse. Well, in the 
first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both 
to know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the South and 
white Southerners, because "At least there, you haven't got to 
play any guessing games"! The guessing games referred to have driven 
more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the 
river. I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with 
conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South is the spirit 
of America". He was born in the North and did his military training 
in the South. He did not, as far as I can gather, find the South 
"worse"; he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the 
second place, though, even if Birmingham <is> worse, no doubt 
Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald 
was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history 
of the world. The world has never lacked for horrifying examples; 
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification 
for our own crimes. This perpetual justification empties 
the heart of all human feeling. The emptier our hearts become, the greater 
will be our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly 
backward region, but a part of this country, and what happens 
there concerns every one of us.   As far as the color problem 
is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern 
white and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically and 
in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and 
they loved him. Historically, the flaming sword laid across this Eden 
is the Civil War. Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual 
coming of age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos are set 
up between himself and his past. Everything, thereafter, is permitted 
him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need. The resulting, 
indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the 
basis of the Southern hysteria.   None of this is true for the 
Northerner. Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps, 
the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners 
see them all the time. Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners 
are never really thinking of anything else. Negroes are, 
therefore, ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South, 
and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner nor 
the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man. It seems 
to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be 
considered either as a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many 
Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few, 
comparatively, 
were lynched), or as a victim (in which case we are promised 
that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our 
kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change- 
<cannot> change- until the North changes. The country will 
not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really 
means by freedom. In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness 
is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks 
around us.   It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one 
cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own: 
in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the 
streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become. 
#4. EAST 
RIVER, DOWNTOWN: POSTSCRIPT TO A LETTER FROM HARLEM#
 THE 
FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U&N& while Adlai 
Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white 
Americans. Stevenson's speech, and the spectacular disturbance 
in the gallery, were both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the 
day before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the course of 
his address, that the United States was "against" colonialism. God 
knows what the African nations, who hold 25 per cent of the voting 
stock in the U&N& were thinking- they may, for example, have 
been thinking of the U&S& abstention when the vote on Algerian 
freedom was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly accurate 
notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking. I had 
intended to be there myself. It was my first reaction upon hearing 
of Lumumba's death. I was curious about the impact of this political 
assassination on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured 
the popular imagination there. I was curious to know if Lumumba's 
death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events, 
would elicit from "our" side anything more than the usual, well-meaning 
rhetoric. And I was curious about the African reaction.
However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U&N& 
gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the eyes of most Americans, 
would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists. The 
climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of 
the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding 
self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were "Communist" 
inspired. Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent 
Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U&N& rioters 
do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community. 
According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters 
were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted <provocateurs>.
I find this view amazing. It is a view which even 
a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict. One 
has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions. 
The first question is: Would <I> like to live here? 
And the second question is: Why don't those who now live here move 
out? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless 
one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that Negroes 
are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can 
escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is 
not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.   Now, 
I do not doubt that, among the people at the U&N& that day, there 
were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the 
most cynical motives. Wherever there is great social discontent, these 
people are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is not as 
frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity. What 
I find appalling- and really dangerous- is the American assumption 
that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical 
agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest. It is a notion 
which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes 
can make no move unless they are manipulated. 
Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until the early fifties.
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction 
of the primitive movies of the nineties. Each film consisted of fifty 
feet, which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen. 
As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason 
to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores 
in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can 
still be found in such urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of 
actual events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes. The sensational 
and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at 
the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats. An 
early Edison production was <The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots>. 
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung 
his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An early film by 
a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss 
performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.   In the field 
of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective 
as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over 
before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded, 
one-minute shows. In response, the industry allowed the discovery 
of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies 
the essential form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer 
beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films, and travelogues, 
despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development 
as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the 
play, the novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically 
successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative 
form from the fiction feature. Thus such great American documentaries 
as <The River> and <The Plow That Broke the Plains> 
were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures. 
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early 
years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French 
magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin 
S& Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for 
he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the 
first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion 
picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained 
since, even in the most inept hands. 
#NARRATIVE TIME AND FILM TIME# 
Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician, 
discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain 
part of the vocabulary of film. One of these is the "dissolve", 
which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene. 
As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins 
to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously, 
one growing weaker, one growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales 
and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped 
to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications, 
resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions. Immediately, the 
film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content 
based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time. 
Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected 
one at a time at such a speed that the eye "remembers" the one 
that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing. Linking 
the smoothly changing images together, the eye itself endows them 
with the illusion of movement. The "projection" time of painting 
and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and 
even varying for a given person on different occasions. So is the time 
of the novel. The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall 
both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the 
players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore, 
to much variation, as record collectors well know. The time of the motion 
picture is fixed absolutely. The film consists of a series of still, 
transparent photographs, or "frames", 35-mm&-wide. Each frame 
comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected 
on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second, 
and, for sound films, 24 frames per second. This is the rate of projection; 
it is also the rate of photographing. Time is built into 
the motion picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time is also 
the concern of the fictional narrative, which is, at its simplest, 
the story of an action with, usually, a beginning, a middle, and an end- 
elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence. 
The "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at the 
audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same 
subject, but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic 
element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which 
would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo. In narrative, 
time is essential, as it is in film. Almost everything about the 
movies that is peculiarly <of> the movies derives from a tension created 
and maintained between narrative time and film time. This discovery 
of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling, 
magician's tricks produced on film.   It was Porter, however, 
who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the 
half century of film history that has since ensued. The movie was <The 
Great Train Robbery> and its effects on the young industry and 
art were all but incalculable. Overnight, for one thing, Porter's 
film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten. <The 
Great Train Robbery> is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to 
twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of <Robbery>, 
1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with <Birth of 
a Nation> in 1915. The reel itself became and still is the standard 
of measure for the movies.   The material of the Porter film 
is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the 
years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old West- 
pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's. A 
band of robbers enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the 
telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed 
and pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape, are whooping 
it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers 
run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot 
dead by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the 
band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.
All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did 
two important things that had not been done before. Each scene is shot 
straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed 
in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the 
capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position 
breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which 
had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at 
a play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the 
plane of the film in the camera or on the screen. If the change, at 
first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters 
about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian 
painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of 
geniuses any art has seen. In that apparently simple shift Porter 
opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of 
art as well as a mechanical recording device.   He did more than 
that. He revealed the potential value of the "cut" as the basic 
technique in the art of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically 
in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word is quite 
physical, to begin with. The physical film is cut with a knife at the 
end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically, 
by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence. If, 
as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable footage of your child 
taking its first steps, you have merely recorded an historical event. 
If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends, 
you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's 
grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in 
film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.
This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the looted 
train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's 
little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only 
to find him bound on the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two 
events are taking place at the same time. Time and space have both become 
cinematic. We leap from event to event- including the formation 
of the posse- even though the events, in "reality" are taking 
place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but 
at a considerable distance.   The "chase" as a standard film 
device probably dates from <The Great Train Robbery>, and there 
is a reason for the continued popularity of the device. The chase in 
itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands 
cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage 
of the journey of both. The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another 
is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other 
form of fiction. The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and 
the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not 
only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; 
these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively 
or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative. 
#THE CREATOR OF THE ART OF THE FILM: D&W&GRIFFITH#
There 
still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full 
potential of the new form and to make it an art. The man was D&W& 
Griffith. When he came to the movies- more or less by accident- 
they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking 
for an idle few minutes. In about seven years Griffith either 
invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource 
at the disposal of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith 
had created the art of the film.   Not that there had not been 
attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that. But in general the European 
efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly 
emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly condensed versions 
of famous novels and famous plays were presented. Great actors 
and actresses- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired 
to repeat their stage performances before the camera. In all of this 
extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status 
of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor 
or by the author. The phonograph today, for all its high fidelity 
and stereophonic sound, is precisely what the early art purveyors in 
the movies wished to make of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach 
did not work. The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques 
in the early years of the century and some interesting records 
of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names. But no art 
at all was born of the art effort in the early movies. 
In general, religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis; 
congregational membership, however, is another thing. A congregation 
survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership; 
that is, when it can preserve economic integration. Religious 
faith can be considered a <necessary> condition of membership in 
a congregation, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires 
some motive force, but faith is not a <sufficient> condition for joining; 
the presence of other members of similar social and economic 
level is the <sufficient> condition.   The breakdown of social 
homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account 
for the decline of central city churches. Central cities reveal 
two adverse features for the major denominations: (1) central cities 
tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; (2) central 
cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition. The central 
city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics which 
violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations: 
they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people 
with lower-class residents. Central city areas have become progressively 
poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus 
of middle-class people from most central cities. With few exceptions, 
the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central 
city.   The key to Protestant development, therefore, is economic 
integration of the nucleus of the congregation. Members of higher 
and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus, so that Protestant 
figures on social class give the impression of spread over all 
social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core of membership 
is 
concentrated in a single social and economic stratum. The congregation 
perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the 
neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so high in metropolitan 
areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum 
in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members 
from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits 
for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration. The 
congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is 
secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily 
a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social 
and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism 
(with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do. 
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.
The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences 
has often been attributed to the "folksy spirit" of Protestant 
religious life; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard 
with the "impersonal" Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that 
the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently, the 
vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress 
on personal community in Protestant congregations; actually, there 
is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations, 
as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability of 
Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of 
the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is 
a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore, 
to the principle of economic integration. This fact is evident 
in the recruitment of new members. 
#MISSION AS CO-OPTATION#
The 
rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the 
missionary outreach of the major denominations. There is much talk 
in theological circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's 
Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact that 
the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in 
the world for the healing of the world. A crucial question, therefore, 
is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism. 
If economic integration really shapes congregational life, then 
evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration. 
The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, 
as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar 
social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation. 
(Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to 
fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power 
from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.) In a 
mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of 
recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of 
economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, 
the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation 
rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been 
carefully studied in the churches; one study in Pittsburgh, however, 
has illuminated the situation. In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh 
churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts 
with friendly members". If we add to these contacts with friendly 
members the "contacts with an organization of the church" (11.2 
per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment 
is through friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound 
approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation show by 
their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people 
respond in kind by joining the church.   Missionary outreach 
by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what 
is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority 
of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic 
position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle 
of informal relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation 
are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths 
of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation; 
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal 
co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people 
who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation. 
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long 
as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people 
who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits 
diminishes, the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no 
longer keep it going.   The transmutation of mission to co-optation 
is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, 
worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members. The 
proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts 
by the clergy (17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts 
by members (over two thirds if organizational activities are included). 
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with 
new members. In general, friendly contact with a member followed by 
contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment 
by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic 
integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission 
in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are 
the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from 
the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will prosper so long 
as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize 
together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability 
of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as 
the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the 
membership. Economic integration ceases when the social and economic 
statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of 
the congregation. In a rapidly changing society congregations will run 
into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration 
are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single 
generation. The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations 
have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred 
years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle 
to maintain economic balance. The expense of this type of organization 
in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which 
deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental 
questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile 
society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations 
illumines the nature of the Protestant development. 
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had 
split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal 
basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends 
seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. Residential 
associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions. 
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential 
communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb, 
Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as 
symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis. 
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved 
with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize 
the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings. 
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the 
drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. This 
conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable 
environment. More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the 
churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan 
life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of 
peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world 
of heterogeneous peoples.   Since American life is committed 
above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the 
countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have 
fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence 
of the metropolis. Consumer communities have suffered at the hands 
of the productive interests. Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural 
newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. Soon they will 
fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches 
will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized 
their history for a century. The identification of the basic unit 
of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a 
residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply 
means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian 
fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. Mission 
to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential 
community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan 
interdependence with residential exclusion.   This interpretation 
of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could 
lead to various projections for the churches. It could be argued 
that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed 
to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the 
middle classes. It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain 
religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities. 
Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational 
and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the 
social identity of middle-class people.   Attention will be given 
in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational 
churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the 
communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes of this style are 
activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. These 
values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating 
the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community 
participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of 
middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major 
denominations. "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly 
contact" form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its contents 
are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued 
by the congregation. What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention 
under the rubric of the organization church. An understanding 
of the new role of residential association in an industrial society 
serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of 
conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.
The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes 
turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs 
and charities should fill the same need. 
With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course 
to pursue.   The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who 
had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company. 
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt 
with the Indians through <engages>, who might be <habitants, voyageurs>, 
or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of 
one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to 
company stores and shipped to France in company ships. The company 
disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.
In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish 
presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians. The lavish 
use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade 
of New France and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change 
in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men. Traders 
from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty 
turned to them. Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded, 
and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian 
insurrections that brought ruin to the company.   In 1721 
the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do 
all that was necessary to protect the colony. They ordered the raising 
of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They 
adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts. 
In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading 
depot to supply the smaller trading houses. For southeastern 
Louisiana, 
Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies 
for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British 
traders. Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending 
northward to the sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse, 
on the Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas 
and Choctaws, but money was available for only one other new 
post, near the present Nashville, Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.
West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi 
district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent upon it 
were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers 
of New Spain.   On the middle Mississippi a principal 
post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped 
that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west, 
principally down the Arkansas River. On the Ohio or Wabash was to 
be built another post "at the fork of two great rivers". Other 
posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication 
with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was 
to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built 
on the Missouri, "where there are mines in abundance". 
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible 
to a director-general at New Orleans. An elaborate system of accounting 
and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the 
most scientific way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision 
of the directors. <Engages> must be loyal to the concessionaires, 
and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended. 
The <habitants> were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose 
of their pelts to the concessionaires.   Only two principal storehouses 
were actually established- one at Mobile, the other at New 
Orleans. New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi, 
and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash. Mobile 
was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district.
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration 
cannot be determined. Regulations for the Indian trade were 
made by the <Conseil superieure de la Louisiane>, and Bienville 
apparently did not have control of that body. The <Conseil> even 
treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and, 
on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise "suitable 
for the peltry trade". It decided, also, that the purely secular 
efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to 
win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.   During the first 
administration of Bienville, the peltry trade of the Mobile district 
was a lucrative source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually 
15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought 
the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins were the raw material 
for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the 
tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods. 
During his first administration, Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina 
traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country. The 
director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French 
goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian 
needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which 
goods could be moved quickly and cheaply. De la Laude, commander 
of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able 
to make them look upon the British as poor competitors. Diron d'Artaguette, 
the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and 
resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors. 
He became, after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama 
River, but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district, 
and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade.   The 
Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district. 
Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama, 
the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was 
easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees. In 1720 some 
Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them, and did not 
make peace for four years. Venturesome traders, however, continued to 
come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts 
for the French markets. British traders from South Carolina incited 
the Indians against the French, and there developed French and 
British Factions in the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion 
for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana. 
To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they 
controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile. 
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region, 
from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French 
settlements near the Gulf.   Bienville realized that if the French 
were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British 
goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant 
as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices. His urgings brought 
some results. The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply 
of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms 
of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians 
must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation 
into and out of the Indian country.   The insistence of Bienville 
upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive 
back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall 
in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained 
as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance. 
Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, 
and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.
The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina, 
and when Perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special 
instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the 
Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements 
to furnish better goods at attractive prices. To the directors 
the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier 
attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among 
the Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference between 
English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians. They 
were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to 
incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were 
to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant 
supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering. 
Perier's intrigues gained some successes. The savages divided 
into two factions; one was British and the other, French. So hostile 
did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke 
out.   Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective 
in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided 
to send troops into the troubled country. He asked the government 
for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest 
English traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's 
restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory. He asked 
also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' 
pelts.   No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation, 
gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette. 
D'Artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many 
hunters. But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon 
French trade in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one 
last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent 
above the cost in France. The Indians were not impressed and held 
to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the 
Mississippi.   With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended 
all profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted. They destroyed 
a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed French shipping 
on the Mississippi. The war to subdue them taxed the resources 
of the colony and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the company 
asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony. 
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently 
blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered 
to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity. 
The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the 
company at 1,450,000 livres. Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana 
was free to all Frenchmen.   Company rule in Louisiana left the 
colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties 
of trade had ruined many <voyageurs>, and numbers of them 
had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families. Others 
left the country, and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade. 
If this trade should be resumed, the <habitants> who had come 
to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must 
be hardened to the severe life of <coureurs de bois>. This was a 
slow and difficult course, and French trade suffered from the many mistakes 
of the new group of traders. These men were without capital or 
experience.   Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either 
to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown 
furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts 
with pelts. Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected 
that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing 
a trade in which they could see no hope of profits. He reported, too, 
that among the <habitants> there were none of probity and ability 
sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did 
find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers 
to trade. With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all 
the traders.   In order to compete with English traders, Bienville 
radically changed the price schedule. The King should expect 
no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France, 
which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all 
he charged the traders. 
They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned 
a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense. 
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if 
it were the source of such reports. Few things are more perilous for 
the State Department than a displeased congressman.   The reason 
for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends 
so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are 
so available. First, the State Department is unique among government 
agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers may be aroused 
if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget. Businessmen 
will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department. 
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department; the 
Chamber of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope of 
pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly 
toward the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The congressman's 
patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense 
Department. Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every 
voter who can write.   With all these agencies, the congressman 
must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly. 
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon 
the State Department in anger.   In many sections he may even 
reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson. After 
all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer, 
or the businessman, but to <foreigners>. Not only do these foreigners 
not vote for American congressmen; they are also probably 
ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department 
men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders 
who have never met a payroll? Will not the righteous congressman 
be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America 
and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes? 
The chances are excellent that he will.   The result is 
that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is 
the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever 
the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People in this 
position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the 
newspapers. State keeps the junketeering list a secret.   The 
Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion. 
Congress is a harsh master. State is expected to arrange the 
touring Cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected 
to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers 
are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with 
their savings for the children's college tuition.   But come 
the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer 
guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money 
for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for 
its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his 
wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will 
systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance 
for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.
In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during 
the Eisenhower years was Representative John J& Rooney, of 
Brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses. 
Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful 
coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing 
worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of 
techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around- friendly persuasion, 
groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful 
congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic 
corps. Rooney remained untouched.   "The trouble" explained 
Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration, 
"is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing, 
it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we 
do".   One year the Department collected a file of case histories 
to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's 
entertainment bills out of personal income. News of the 
project reached the press. Next day, reports went through the Department 
that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt 
to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances 
and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not 
rise a dollar. They didn't.   The Department's constant 
fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic 
bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional 
power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries 
a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's 
back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.   With 
its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by 
keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it 
did with Dean Acheson. John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his 
personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then 
operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition. During 
Dulles's first two years in office, while Republicans ran the 
Senate, the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for 
its 
blood since 1945.   An internal police operation managed by Scott 
McLeod, a former F&B&I& man installed as security officer 
upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance. So was 
the attack upon Charles E& Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him 
Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler, however, was Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle 
for the Department, Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates. 
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats, 
Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men 
had their way.   In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede 
that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention 
by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him 
and the country's foreign policy. In any event, the example of Acheson's 
trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke 
it. He elected to "get along".   During this dark chapter 
in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas 
later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol 
Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious 
logic of the time, with present treasonous intent. Their successors, 
absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.   This, 
in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats 
took control. In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually 
barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit 
the Russians. For three or four years in the mid-1950's, this 
complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there 
was a dull legislative afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault 
was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by 
anyone but himself.   An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth 
of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying 
anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation. #@ 
GETTING ALONG WITH FOREIGNERS#
THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign 
embassies and legations in Washington. They range from the Soviet 
Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a 
funeral-accessories 
display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called 
"that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street", the modern cement-and-glass 
chancery of the Belgians.   Here is the world of the 
chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers 
and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher, 
and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired 
Lothario.   Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries 
around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions 
on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies. 
Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty, 
the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner. 
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting 
to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington. 
Some, like the British and the French, maintain an elaborate 
system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special 
areas of the American scene. Other embassies cable home <The 
New York Times> without changing a comma.   Each has its peculiar 
style. The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage 
headquarters. When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over 
in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change 
this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a ~TV announcer's 
grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's astonishment he seemed 
no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt 
was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.   Where his predecessors 
had glowered, Menshikov smiled. Where they had affected the 
bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, Menshikov went abroad 
gorgeous in white tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available 
man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the 
vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club 
alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase, it was the most 
unheard-of thing ever heard of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception 
swore that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"? 
And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike". 
"Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave him. His English 
was usable and he used it fearlessly. Toasting in champagne one 
night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and 
gaily cried: "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that 
coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation 
of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts 
complained that the Capitol was out of its wits. Newspaper punditry 
was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to 
smile.   The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians 
usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable 
because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin' 
Mike" dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional 
story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.
The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and the most 
inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians. When King Saud 
visited Washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press 
was the size of his family. Rumor had it that his children numbered 
in the hundreds. The State Department was little help on this, or 
on much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted a Middle 
East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until 
the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a 
brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This 
is where I get my information from", he confided. "But bring it 
right back. It's the only copy I've got".   The size of 
Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his 
first meeting with Eisenhower. When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert 
robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview. 
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American 
friendship to bore in on the central question. How many 
children did the King have?   "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.
And how many of these were sons?   "Twenty-five", 
the sheik replied.   "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter 
asked, "that the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom 
are sons"?   The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is 
precisely correct".   The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness 
of language. When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East 
peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon found himself 
speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo, a language as anarchic 
as Casey Stengel's. The reports of President Nasser's pledges 
which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became 
increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli 
Foreign Minister, Mrs& Golda Meir. Finally he reported that 
Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli 
concessions. 
The deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the 
washing is done outside. I know now why our Japanese friends were 
surprised when they walked into our bathroom.   Of course, most 
toilets are Eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are 
raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets- inside. 
A few newer homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running 
water, they are usually Eastern style.   The next day I visited 
International Christian College which has developed since the war 
under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan 
well. They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching 
and learning. The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical 
stockroom. Spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need 
to be Christian. They have an enviable record of being able to place 
in employment 100% of their graduates.   In the afternoon Miss 
Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs& 
Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs& 
Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful, 
artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household- 
(four boys and four girls), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle Japanese 
woman. She was a real experience! The dances were as beautiful 
as anything I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes 
for scenery and precision as well as imagination.   Because 
Don was leaving the next day, I spent the evening with him at Asia 
Center. The following morning Mr& Morikawa called for me, and 
we went to visit schools- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary 
school, and high school- Mr& Yoshimoto's school. There 
is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some think 
too much.   There is a great deal of thought being given to 
the question of moral education in the schools. With the loss of the 
Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God 
or moral teachings that have strength. The older parents continued 
to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people, 
who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents. There seems 
to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles 
to give stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and freely, 
with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere, especially among 
students. Parents indulge their children.   The government 
has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education 
for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction 
and are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese 
soldiers would not fight again- for why should they? It will be 
painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will 
create or what strong convictions they will develop.   In the evening 
the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the 
New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good. 
They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good, 
except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six of the 
science teachers were present, and we had great fun. 
#KYOTO#
After 
a day at Nikko, Mrs& Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto. 
My instructions were that Mr& Nishimo would meet me at the hotel, 
but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm 
welcome. My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan 
Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen, 
but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did explain to the students, 
however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very 
small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well. They 
understood and teased me a bit about it.   I think I would have 
been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara, 
and Hiroshima. Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its 
cultural center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war- 
and 
is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan. Here 
I was accompanied by Mrs& Okamoto (Fumio's mother), her son, 
Mr& Washizu (a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding 
for more than a year), and Mr& Nishima, one of the science 
teachers. I arrived at 7:00 a&m& and by 9:00 a&m& I had 
finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned. 
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens. We visited the 
Okamoto home- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony. 
At 6:00 p&m& we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place 
where these beautiful dances originated. They were even better than 
those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.   After 
a supper of <unagi> (rice with eel- eel which is raised in an 
ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt& Fuji), I returned to my beautiful 
room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day. 
We started at 9 a&m& to visit the Kyoto University where Mr& 
Washizu is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities 
accompanying the medical school. They apologized for the condition, 
including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what 
to say. There seemed to be no excuse? I don't have the answer 
yet.   We had tea at Mr& Washizu's home where I learned 
that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His grandfather is 
a Buddhist priest; and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest, 
but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become 
the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for only a few 
years ago he would have had no choice. In his big home live four families 
and thirty people, so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed 
here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old- 
paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc&. He had displayed more of them 
than usual so that I could enjoy them. About 100 of the most important 
items he had already given to the museum. The house itself is 400 
years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried times. 
#NARA, 
OSAKA, AND HIROSHIMA#
Mr& Nishima went with me on the train 
to Nara. We passed his house and school on the way. In Nara I 
stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their 
honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid for their coming, but I 
walked on it, too. Here Mr& Yoneda met us after a three-hour train 
trip from the town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles 
in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.
In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles 
to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima. Again the plan was 
for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr& Yoneda 
had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr& Nishima 
and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night. 
It is the second largest city in Japan, with about four million people. 
One spot in Osaka I shall always remember- the bridge where 
we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the 
still waters of the river. In the midst of a great busy city, people 
take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.
My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 
a&m&. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little, 
after which Mr& Uno would arrive and pilot me around. But there 
he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.
I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even 
when I told them I didn't want to. They knew that I was still grieving 
over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the 
recovery 
and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also 
regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better 
a new Japan. There were no words to say this but there was no need.
The teachers of Mr& Uno's school gave me a small gift 
to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better city than it was before- 
in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace 
and understanding. I was grateful for their insight into my need 
for this experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima. 
#TOKYO#
On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took 
us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University. 
This day was "Open House for Parents" day, and the girls were 
busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables. Everything was in 
an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.   It was 
thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese 
students in a class in Home Planning. Our Masu is one of the very 
few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family 
functions and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come when 
women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now 
it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants. Many 
of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American 
homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese 
artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the 
Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.   At this Women's 
University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed 
that Japanese women also should be educated. Even today there are 
some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this 
University continues to grow and to send its students out into the 
community. Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus 
where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they 
can have their social gatherings and professional meetings. As far 
as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the 
creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found 
by educated women unafraid to break traditions.   Masu is also 
teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo. 
Here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled 
in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They learn how 
to take care of children and sick members of the family. They have model 
kitchens, a sick room with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with 
a life-like doll. Although the training is only for one month, it 
is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's school are much 
in demand and can always find work immediately. Occasionally they return 
for additional training. Masu's home economics training comes 
into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for 
the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also uses the training she got 
in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, 
and work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education in 
the United States, not just in a classroom, but also in an American 
house with an American housekeeper, stands her in good stead. 
#UNIVERSITY 
OF TOKYO#
After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen 
of which Masu had planned, Mr& Washizu and I left to meet representatives 
of the ~USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo. 
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could 
not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous 
in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant. 
The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only 
by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following 
consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads 
of certain national chain stores should, of course, be applauded. But 
for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of 
a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts 
contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions 
in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing 
a connection between general company practice and local practice 
in the South, and by establishing such direct connection between the 
practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York 
and general company policy. Then the boycott would not be secondary, 
but a primary one. It would be directed against the actual location of 
the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice, 
must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury 
of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy. Perhaps 
this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire 
national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire 
economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores 
in the matter of segregation. Such a general boycott might still be a 
blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable 
justification. 
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove 
most decisive and is most clearly legitimate. Moreover, prudence alone 
would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to 
fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon 
national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage 
to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to 
greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even 
(as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure 
to correct injustice) to its going out of business in certain sections 
of the country (as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many 
meetings in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business 
in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover 
a large number of southern adherents).   In any case, anyone who 
fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary 
applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified 
that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years 
ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils 
in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer 
in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a 
national ~TV network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed, 
a "high yellow gal" smooching with a white man. It is true, 
of course, that the end or objective of this action was different. But 
since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals 
and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where 
direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the 
matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not 
effectively present, there has to be a <morality of means> applied in 
every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures 
or other forms of force.   the need that we not give unqualified 
approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed 
against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the 
fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation 
mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical 
violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically 
opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow 
humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously 
brutal means. The end or aim of the action, of course, is also 
important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community 
customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person 
from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e&g&, against 
Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the 
present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance 
to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies. This, however, 
is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and 
economic conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war of all 
against all no less than if other means are used. It is also sufficient 
to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs 
to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his <conduct> 
is just, i&e&, that, if economic pressure has to be resorted 
to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the 
way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while, 
if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily 
(however inevitably) and not by deliberate intent and direct 
action against them.   It is clear that non-violent resistance is 
a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian 
morality, like any other form of resistance. The <language> used 
itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle 
for victory (perhaps to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in 
leaders has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom 
of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in the world today 
might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom 
is going to march over them". The present writer certainly agrees 
with that statement, and would also affirm this- in the order of justice. 
However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity 
interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches 
forward. And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice 
and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental 
good will. It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained 
above, and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent 
means. 
R& B& Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will of 
the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical 
jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance. He 
suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent 
resistance of most victims would render him"; and again, that 
"the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object 
of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will, 
to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope. In another respect 
it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent 
only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is 
based on sounder values".   A trial of strength, however, is made 
quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent 
resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder 
values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means, 
men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause. This makes necessary 
a morality of means, and principles governing the <conduct> of 
resistance whenever this is thought to be justified. The question, 
then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent 
means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes 
and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing 
him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some 
causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem 
insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently. 
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into 
the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem 
the more unlimited aggression.   Among Christian groups, the 
Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that 
the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the 
Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the will and word of God 
are for them concentrated in Christlike love, it seems clear to them 
that non-violent resistance is quite another thing. "The primary 
objective of non-violence", writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, 
"is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain 
desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage". 
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must 
certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any 
form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and 
affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine 
the moral principles limiting resistance. These principles we 
have now set forth. <Economy> in the use of power needs not only to 
be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is done it will 
be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across 
the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to 
both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action. 
Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a 
<barely 
intolerable> pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed. 
That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly 
in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals. There 
must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use 
of means of resistance, violent or non-violent. The justification 
in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays 
down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against 
whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted 
also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the 
sake even of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic 
withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading 
in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these 
distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be 
singled out.   We may now take up for consideration a hard case 
which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure 
or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above. 
There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken 
at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination 
against a whole people. An excellent article was published recently in 
the journal of the Church Peace Union by a South African journalist 
on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa, 
amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic <complicity> of both 
the government and the people of the United States in these conditions. 
"**h Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors 
but also from the pockets of U& S& taxpayers", this author 
states, "are being poured into South Africa to support a system 
dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical 
exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens 
not to be white". Both the conditions and the complicity are documented 
in considerable detail. This leads to the conclusion that "the 
fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not 
<apartheid> shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic 
boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with 
the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as 
a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our 
own country, but also in accord with our law, U&S& Code Title 
19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced 
or convict labor. Not only should this provision be enforced but 
other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author 
believes, "must surely be supported by every American who values the 
freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated 
by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly 
contribute to the enslavement of another nation".
NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights 
and of integration. They have also led the nation in the direction 
of a welfare state. And both in their objectives of non-discrimination 
and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners 
who are called Bourbons. The name presumably derives from the 
French royal house which never learned and never forgot; since Bourbon 
whiskey, though of Kentucky origin, is at least as much favored 
by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South.   The 
nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little 
understood in the North. The race problem has tended to obscure other, 
less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive. 
It is these other differences between North and South- other, 
that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare- 
which I chiefly discuss herein.   I write about Northern liberals 
from considerable personal experience. A Southerner married to 
a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting 
town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men, 
and business executives of egghead tastes. Most of them are Democrats 
and nearly all consider themselves, and are viewed as, liberals. This 
is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of 
liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center 
are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that 
the best government was the least government. Yet paradoxically my 
liberal 
friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints. 
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and 
democracy, I find that they fall into two categories: the simpler 
ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without 
analysis; and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that 
these things don't count any more in the world of to-day. I am naive, 
they say, to make use of such words.   I take this to mean 
that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical?- liberal 
considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will 
assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual 
and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield 
before it. This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian 
bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try 
to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court. As for states' 
rights, they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends 
except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist 
now only as anachronisms.   The American liberal may, in the world 
of to-day, have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed 
in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one. Why, in the first place, 
call himself a liberal if he is against <laissez-faire> and favors 
an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over 
everybody? If he attaches little importance to personal liberty, 
why not make this known to the world? And if he is so scornful of 
the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution 
that he could more sincerely support?   I am concerned here, 
however, with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South. It 
appears to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort 
to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends. His assumption 
seems to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more 
liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy 
with his views. <Time's> editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, 
<The Waist-High Culture>, wrote: "**h most of what was 
different about it (the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to 
**h". This, for the liberals I know, would be an understatement. 
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate 
hatred that was directed against Fascism.   I do not think 
that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the 
North. In business circles, usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere 
would hardly be found. But in our case- and neither my wife nor 
I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional 
outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and 
come close to wrecking several more. In fact it has caused us to give 
serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy 
for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host 
is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners 
who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards 
down.   Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in 
the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state-supported 
universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority 
view. But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected 
to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in 
social gatherings. From my wife's experience and other sources, this 
seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles. The strong feeling 
is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among 
college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who 
studied in the North. And social relations arising out of business 
ties impose courtesy, if not sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners. 
Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the 
prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.   There 
are of course many Souths; but for this discussion the most important 
division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who 
haven't. My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed 
rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War. Nobody 
knows how many Southerners there are in this category. I suspect 
that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to 
believe. I never heard of a poll being taken on the question. No doubt 
such a thing would be considered unpatriotic. Prior to 1954 I imagine 
that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy. 
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is 
more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following 
the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would 
have been for the Old South.   Belief in the traditional way of 
life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones. Probably 
a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain 
unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia, North Carolina, and 
Alabama following along after them. Old attitudes are held more tenaciously 
in the Tidewater than the Piedmont; so that a line running 
down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater 
would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course, 
important minority enclaves.   The long-settled areas of states 
like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture 
to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and 
the consciousness of loss the greater. Also, we should not even to-day 
discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering 
on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies 
than with the North even after independence. The social and psychological 
consequences of this continue to affect the area. In certain 
respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South. 
Poor where they had once been rich, humbled where they had been 
arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the 
nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from 
the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country. And 
no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia, which 
were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century, bitterly 
regretted the revolt against the Crown.   Among Bourbons 
the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed 
than other factors. All Southerners agree that slavery had to 
go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling 
it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did. Southern 
resentment has been over the method of its ending, the invasion, 
and Reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro 
political control in many counties. But apart from racial problems, 
the old unreconstructed South- to use the moderate words favored by 
Mr& Thomas Griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what 
is different about the civilization of the North. And this, in effect, 
means most of modern America.   It is hard to see how the 
situation could be otherwise. And therein, I feel, many Northerners 
delude themselves about the South. For one thing, this is not a subject 
often discussed or analyzed. There seems to be almost a conspiracy 
of silence veiling it. I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful 
thinking: don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and 
they will take care of themselves. Or else the North really believes 
that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come 
around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers 
of the American Dream, like everybody else.   If the circumstances 
are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be 
true. The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western 
world. Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area 
appropriate to a pre-World-War-/1, great power have been, following 
conquest, 
ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had 
imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike. And the 
great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent. 
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic 
origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign 
domination. The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot 
and cold. In every war of the United States since the Civil War 
the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country. So instead 
of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the 
two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances 
and cement reunion. And there is no section of the nation more 
ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism. Had the 
situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 
1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is 
little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put 
on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain. It 
is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners 
should have been as docile as they have. The North should thank its 
stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not 
draw false inferences therefrom.   The two main charges levelled 
against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social 
reactionaries. There is much truth in both these charges, and not 
many Bourbons deny them. Whatever their faults, they are not hypocrites. 
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best 
race in the world and that it should remain pure. Many Northeners 
believe this, too, but few of them will say so publicly. The Bourbon 
economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern 
conservatives. But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed 
go much further than this. They believe that if the South 
had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that 
of modern America. As it is, they consider that the North is now 
reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high 
standard of living the "American way" has been proved inferior 
to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the 
socialistic features of the latter.   The South's antipathy 
to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh 
accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy 
and the use of leisure. Their own easier, slower tempo is especially 
dear to Southerners; and I have heard many say that they are content 
to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because 
they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.
In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry Maine noted 
long ago, were only two in number: internal order and external security. 
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men, 
the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order 
within its territorial borders. Outside those limits it asserted, as 
against other states, a position of sovereign equality, and, as against 
the "inferior" peoples of the non-Western world, a position of 
dominance. It became the sole "subject" of "international law" 
(a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham), 
a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western 
nations could do in the world arena. (That corpus of law was a 
reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. Speaking generally, it furthered- and still 
tends to further- the interests of the Western powers. The enormous 
changes in world politics have, however, thrown it into confusion, so 
much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in 
need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions 
of the present era.)   Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned 
above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state 
responsibility, either internally or externally. This was particularly 
true in the world arena, which was an anarchical battleground characterized 
by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires. 
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have 
astonished a nineteenth-century statesman. His duty was to his sovereign 
and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial 
boundaries was not to be contemplated. Thus, to cite but one 
example, the <Pax Britannica> of the nineteenth century, whether with 
the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling 
world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other 
nations (e&g&, the United States) may have incidentally benefited. 
At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal 
responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial 
state was strongly resisted. Social Darwinism was able to stave 
off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.
However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are multiple 
reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has 
occurred in both facets of national activity. A concept of responsibility 
is in process of articulation and establishment. Already firmly 
implanted internally, it is a growing factor in external matters. 
##
A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned 
an important corner. In what has aptly been called a "constitutional 
revolution", the basic nature of government was transformed from 
one essentially negative in nature (the "night-watchman state") to 
one with affirmative duties to perform. The "positive state" came 
into existence. For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences, 
there has been a special fascination since then in the role 
played by the Supreme Court in that transformation- the manner in 
which its decisions altered in "the switch in time that saved nine", 
President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious "Court-packing 
plan", the imprimatur of judicial approval that was 
finally placed upon social legislation. Of greater importance, however, 
is the content of those programs, which have had and are having enormous 
consequences for the American people. Labor relations have been 
transformed, income security has become a standardized feature of political 
platforms, and all the many facets of the American version of 
the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom. A national 
consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts 
are desirable as well as necessary. Ratified in the Republican Party 
victory in 1952, the Positive State is now evidenced by political 
campaigns being waged not on <whether> but on <how much> social 
legislation there should be.   The general acceptance of the idea 
of governmental (i&e&, societal) responsibility for the economic 
well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant 
watersheds in American constitutional history. The other, of 
course, was the Civil War, the conflict which a century ago insured 
national unity over fragmentation. A third, one of at least equal and 
perhaps even greater importance, is now being traversed: American 
immersion and involvement in world affairs.   Internal national 
responsibility, now a truism, need not be documented. Nevertheless, 
it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for, as 
will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept. Thirty 
years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression, 
the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow 
"natural forces" to operate and cure the distress. That guiding 
principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the 
New Deal; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the 
Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the 
responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment. 
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through 
planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution. In 
1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration 
came when the principle of <national> responsibility for <local> 
economic distress won out over a "state's-responsibility" 
proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief 
by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted 
with manpower surplus. The American people have indeed come 
a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.   Internal 
national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the 
Industrial Revolution. Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption 
of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals 
to cope with the rigors of the era. National responsibility for 
individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or 
even to the Western nations. A measure of its widespread acceptance 
may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists 
in 1959. Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International 
Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world, 
the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law 
to include affirmative governmental duties. It is noteworthy that 
the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed, 
former colonial nations. The Rule of Law, historically a principle 
according everyone his "day in court" before an impartial tribunal, 
was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of 
government to promote individual welfare. Recognizing that the Rule 
of Law is "a dynamic concept **h which should be employed not only 
to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free 
society", the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility 
"to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions 
under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized". 
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common 
feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world. For better or for worse, 
we all now live in welfare states, the organizing principle of which 
is collective responsibility for individual well-being.   Whether 
a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility 
operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more 
difficult to establish. The hypothesis ventured here is that it does, 
and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition. The content 
is not the same, however: rather than individual security, it 
is the security and continuing existence of an "ideological group"- 
those in the "free world"- that is basic. External national 
responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of 
the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability 
of other friendly nations. If internal responsibility suggests acceptance 
of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility 
implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.
Reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty- 
may help to reveal the contours of the new principle. In its beginnings 
the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally, 
against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence 
of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church. The breakup of 
the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more 
than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism. (Since the time-span 
of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence 
of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural 
for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest 
form of order, something permanent and unchanging.) The concept of 
nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies 
the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure. But 
it is more than that. For it includes the emotional ties that bind 
men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large 
group of people together as a unit. Today, as new nations rise from 
the former colonial empires, nationalism is one of the hurricane forces 
loose in the world. Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has 
become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that 
nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm. Historically, however, 
the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the 
Western civilizational group. By subduing disparate lesser groups 
the nation has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual 
liberty. Within their confines, moreover, technological and 
industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing 
the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied. While the 
pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism 
has in fact served the Western peoples well. (Whether historical nationalism 
helped the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether 
today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial 
aspects, are other questions.)   It is one of the ironic quirks 
of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the 
territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that 
the nation-state attained its highest number (approximately 100). But 
it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is 
no longer a tenable concept is <because> it has spread throughout the 
planet. In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had 
limited application, both as to geography and as to population; it 
becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal 
principle of sovereignty. The former receives its legitimacy from the 
latter. Operating side by side, together they helped shore up the nation-state. 
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present 
usage it is essentially modern. Jean Bodin, writing in the sixteenth 
century, may have been the seminal thinker, but it was the vastly influential 
John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now 
understood. Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty 
still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking. To 
him, law is the command of the sovereign (the English monarch) who 
personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to 
make law- i&e&, to prevail over internal groups and to be free 
from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations. These fundamental 
ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual (internal-external) 
aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate 
political power.   The nation-state, then, exemplifies the principle 
of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over 
domestic affairs and independence from outside control. In fact, however, 
both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined. High-level 
abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision. 
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic 
societies, in which "popular" sovereignty is said to exist, 
and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split. Nevertheless, 
nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted 
wisdom, to describe the modern world. Is there a different reality behind 
the facade? Does the surface hide a quite different picture?
The short answer to those questions is "yes". Both concepts 
are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted 
by a concept of national responsibility. As evidence to support 
that view, consider the following illustrative instances. 
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident? What steps have been 
taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the 
destruction of continents? Are we as safe as we should be from such 
a disaster? Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety? 
Will the danger increase or decrease?   I have just asked 
these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of 
key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl 
for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain 
Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as "Sherwood 
Forest". I asked the same questions inside the launch-control 
rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear 
sidearms are manning the "commit buttons" that could start a war- 
accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other 
pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.   To 
the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments 
and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of 
tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched. 
There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate. 
"Readiness exercises" are almost continuous. Each could be the real 
thing.   In the command centers there are special clocks ready 
to tick off the minutes elapsed since "~E hour". "~E" 
stands for "execution"- the moment a "go order" would unleash 
an American nuclear strike. There is little time for the men in the 
command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks. 
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing 
colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business 
machines. They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical 
details. Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people 
who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so 
they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.   Among 
the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others 
charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their 
"hardware", the answers to my questions varied partly according to 
a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call "scenarios". 
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it: "You can't have 
dry runs on this one". The experts are thus forced to hypothesize 
sequences of events that have never occurred, probably never will- 
but possibly might. Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with 
these men: The more highly placed they are- that is, the more they 
know- the more concerned they have become.   Already accidental 
war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration 
about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions 
of national security. Only recently new "holes" were 
discovered in our safety measures, and a search is now on for more. Work 
is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed 
on all nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, the experts speak of 
wars triggered by "false pre-emption", "escalation", "unauthorized 
behavior" and other terms that will be discussed in this report. 
They inhabit a secret world centered on "go codes" and "gold 
phones". Their conversations were, almost invariably, accompanied 
by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward 
each other in arclike semicircular motions. One arm represented our bombers 
and missiles, the other arm "theirs". Yet implicit in each 
movement was the death of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, perhaps 
you and me- and the experts.   These men are not callous. 
It is their job to think about the unthinkable. Unanimously they believe 
that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more 
Russians and Communist Chinese, too- thought about accidental 
war.   The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box 
within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle, a 
frail, meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist. He was, and is, with the 
~RAND Corporation, a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the 
U& S& Air Force. His investigations made him the Paul Revere 
of accidental war, and safety procedures were enormously increased.
In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal 
by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy 
has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war 
danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.   The 
chain starts at ~BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning 
System) in Thule, Greenland. Its radar screens would register Soviet 
missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States. 
~BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to ~NORAD 
(North American Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado, for interpretation; to the ~SAC command and control 
post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near 
Omaha, Nebraska; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.   Telephones, 
Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems and, in some cases, television, 
link all vital points. Alternate locations exist for all key command 
centers. For last-ditch emergencies ~SAC has alternate command 
posts on ~KC-135 jet tankers. Multiple circuits, routings and 
frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.   The 
same principle of "redundancy" applies to all communications on these 
special networks. And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits 
until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special 
codes, 
that the messages actually come from their purported sources. Additional 
codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.
Only the President is permitted to authorize the 
use of nuclear weapons. That's the law. But what if somebody decides 
to break it? The President cannot personally remove the safety 
devices from every nuclear trigger. He makes the momentous decision. 
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers 
and to push the buttons. What if one or more of them turn irrational 
or suddenly, coolly, decide to clobber the Russians? What if the President 
himself, in the language of the military, "goes ape"? 
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets 
without provocation?   Nobody can be absolutely certain of 
the answers. However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully, 
so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.   Even 
the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a "go" order. 
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the 
"go code". In an emergency he would receive available intelligence 
on the "gold-phone circuit". A system of "gold"- actually 
yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of 
the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the ~SAC 
commander and other key men. All can be connected with the gold circuit 
from their homes. All could help the President make his decision. 
The talk would not be in code, but neither would it ramble. Vital 
questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda. 
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured 
me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the 
gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from ~BMEWS.
If communications work, his decision would be instantly known 
in all command posts that would originate the actual go order. For 
these centers, too, are on the gold circuit. They include the Navy's 
Atlantic Command at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with 
the Polaris subs; ~NATO headquarters in Europe; Air Force 
forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific, which control 
tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and ~SAC, which controls 
long-range bombers and Atlas missiles.   Let us look in on 
one of these nerve centers- ~SAC at Omaha- and see what must 
still happen before a wing of ~B-52 bombers could drop their ~H-bombs.
In a word, plenty. The key man almost certainly would 
be Col& William W& Wisman, ~SAC's senior controller. He 
or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, all full colonels, 
mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day. It is a quiet 
but impressive room- 140 feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, twenty-one 
feet high. Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts 
are crammed with intelligence information. And Bill Wisman, forty-three, 
a farmer's son from Beallsville, Ohio, is a quiet but impressive 
man. His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown. His movements 
and speech are precise, clear and quick. No question ruffles him 
or causes him to hesitate.   Wisman, who has had the chief controller's 
job for four years, calls the signals for a team operating 
three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights, switches and buttons. 
At least a dozen men, some armed, are never far away from him. 
In front of him is a gold phone. In emergencies the ~SAC commander, 
Gen& Thomas Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy 
a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman 
and his staff. At General Power's seat in the balcony there is 
also a gold phone. General Power would participate in the decision 
making. Wisman, below, would listen in and act. His consoles can give 
him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and 
with every ~SAC aircraft.   He need only pick up one of 
the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the 
big red button marked ALERT. (There are two receivers in case 
one should be dropped and damaged.)   But Wisman, too, does not 
know the go code. He must take it from "the red box". In point 
of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half 
feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to 
Wisman's right. The box is internally wired so the door can never 
be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ("It's real obnoxious").
Now we must become vague, for we are approaching 
one of the nation's most guarded secrets. The codes in the red box- 
there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained 
in a sealed ~X-ray-proof "unique device". They are supplied, 
a batch at a time, by a secret source and are continually changed 
by Wisman or his staff, at random intervals.   But even the contents 
of Wisman's box cannot start a war. They are mere fragments, 
just one portion of preprepared messages. What these fragments are 
and how they activate the go order may not be revealed. The pieces must 
be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff. 
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures 
which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special 
codes, each message also contains an "internal authenticator", 
another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting 
the real thing.   I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke 
out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one. "I'd wind 
up full of .38 bullet holes", he said, and there was no question that 
he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.   Now let 
us imagine a wing of ~B-52's, on alert near their "positive control 
(or fail-safe) points", the spots on the map, many miles from 
Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific 
orders to proceed to their targets. They, too, have fragments of 
the go code with them. As Wisman put it, "They have separate pieces 
of the pie, and we have the whole pie. Once we send out the whole 
pie, they can put their pieces into it. Unless we send out the whole 
pie, their pieces mean nothing". Why does Wisman's ever-changing 
code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers? 
The answer is a cryptographic secret. At any rate, three 
men out of a six-man ~B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's 
go-to-war message. Each must match Wisman's "pie" with the 
fragment that he carries with him. All three must compare notes and agree 
to "go". ##
After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated 
work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum 
of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each 
with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released. 
Unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals 
from the handles removed first- no damage can be done.
Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the game ended. They 
went as rigid as black statuary **h six figures, lean and tall and 
angular, went still. Their heads were in the air sniffing. They all 
swung at the same instant in the same direction. They saw it before 
I did, even with my binoculars. It was nothing more than a tiny distant 
rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds 
to the earth. In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree, 
no more. A white man would not have seen it. The aborigines fastened 
upon it with a concentration beyond pathos. Watching, they waited 
until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant 
across the dry burning land. At once the whole band set off at a lope. 
They were chasing a rain cloud.   They went after the squall 
as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow. I followed them 
in the jeep and now they did not care. The games were over, this 
was life. Occasionally, for no reason that I could see, they would suddenly 
alter the angle of their trot. Sometimes I guessed it was because 
the rain squall had changed direction. Sometimes it was to skirt 
a gulley. Their gait is impossible to convey in words. It has nothing 
of the proud stride of the trained runner about it, it is not a lope, 
it is not done with style or verve. It is the gait of the human who 
must run to live: arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground, 
head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target, 
a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully 
graceful. It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.
They ran for three hours. Finally, avoiding hummocks and seeking low 
ground, they intercepted the rain squall. For ten minutes they ran 
beneath the squall, raising their arms and, for the first time, shouting 
and capering. Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady. 
They were studying the ground. Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a 
few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground. He had found 
a depression with rain water in it. He bent down, a black cranelike figure, 
and put his mouth to the ground.   With a lordly and generous 
gesture, 
the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows. The 
other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle. In an instant 
he had sucked it dry.   The aborigine lives on the cruelest land 
I have ever seen. Which does not mean that it is ugly. Part of it 
is, of course. There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which 
are hideous. They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so 
many centuries that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges 
fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty 
feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand. 
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality. But much of the land 
which the aborigine wanders <looks> as if it should be hospitable. 
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has a peaceful quality, 
the hills roll softly.   The malignancy of such a landscape 
has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean. He 
tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock, 
a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer. They went well-equipped 
with everything except knowledge of the "outback" country. "
The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle 
slopes and soft gray tree-clumps. Nothing appalling or horrible rushed 
upon these men. Only there happened- nothing. There might have 
been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only- 
there was not. It might have rained, any time; only- it did not. 
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise; 
only- there was not. They lay, with the birds hopping from branch 
to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them. No one 
came".   The white men died. And countless others like them have 
died. Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of 
men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly 
lost direction, were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant 
and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally died.
The aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard 
and pitiless. He knows that the economy of life in the "outback" 
is awful. There is no room for error or waste. Any organism that falters 
or misperceives the signals or weakens is done. I do not know 
if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge, but 
I suspect that it can. Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his 
odd air of dignity. 
#THE FAMILY AT THE BOULDER#
SEEING an aborigine 
today is a difficult thing. Many of them have drifted into the 
cities and towns and seaports. Others are confined to vast reservations, 
and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish 
them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they 
are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for <corroborees> 
at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch- 
which is very low indeed.   I persuaded an Australian friend 
who had lived "outback" for years to take me to see some aborigines 
living in the bush. It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation, 
even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge 
of the aborigines and their language. Finally, however, the arrangements 
were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover. We 
followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a 
smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth. 
The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big 
red boulder, swung off the road. At once he started to glance toward 
the instrument panel. It took me a moment to realize what was odd 
about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked 
gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about. The rancher 
was navigating his way across the flatland.   "Do you always 
navigate like this"? I asked.   "Damned right", he 
said. "Once I get out on the flat I do. Some chaps that know an 
area well can make their way by landmarks **h a tree here, a wash here, 
a boulder there. But if you don't know the place like the palm of 
your hand, you'd better use a compass and the speedometer. Two miles 
northeast, then five miles southwest **h that sort of thing. Very 
simple".   He was right. The landscape kept repeating itself. 
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was 
hopeless. Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines. They 
were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man, his lubra, 
and two children. The sun was not yet high and all of them were in 
the small area 
of shade cast by the boulder.   There was also a dog, 
a dingo dog. Its ribs showed, it was a yellow nondescript color, 
it suffered from a variety of sores, hair had scabbed off its body in 
patches. It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving, 
watching us carefully. It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished 
dog. No one patted the dog. It was not a pet. It was a worker.
"The buggers love shade", the rancher said. "I suppose 
because it saves them some loss of body water. They'll move around 
that rock all day, following the shade. During the hottest part of 
the day, of course, the sun comes straight down and there isn't any 
shade".   We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land Rover, 
and walked over toward the family.   The man was leaning against 
the rock. He gazed away from us as we approached. He was over 
six feet tall and very thin. His legs were narrow and very long. Every 
bone and muscle in his body showed, but he did not give the appearance 
of starving. He had long black hair and a wispy beard. The ridges 
over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut. There was something 
about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds 
to realize what. It was not merely that flies were crawling over his 
face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into 
his eye sockets. A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into 
the socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and across the wet 
surface of the eyeball, and the eye did not blink. The Australian 
and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered 
by insects, but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.
I turned to look at the lubra. She remained squatting on her heels 
all the time we were there; like the man, she was entirely naked. 
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family 
possessions which were placed in front of her. There were two rubbing 
sticks for making fire, two stones shaped roughly like knives, a woven-root 
container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead 
body of some rodent. There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera, 
a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity 
and high accuracy. There was also a boomerang, elaborately carved. Everything 
was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects 
seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.
The two children, both boys, wandered around the Australian 
and me for a few moments and then returned to their work. They squatted 
on their heels with their heads bent far forward, their eyes only 
a few inches from the ground. They had located the runway of a colony 
of ants and as the ants came out of the ground, the boys picked them 
up, one at a time, and pinched them dead. The tiny bodies, dropped onto 
a dry leaf, made a pile as big as a small apple.   The odor 
here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines. 
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant. It was also 
subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied 
innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed. 
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant. 
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one. The smell is sexual, but 
so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.   Their 
skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost 
the consistency of a second skin. They roll at night in ashes to keep 
warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it. In spots 
such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized 
the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating 
of sweat, dirt, and ashes were a cosmetic. The boys had beautiful 
dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies 
and blinked their eyes.   "That smell is something, eh, mate"? 
the Australian asked. "They swear that every person smells 
different and every family smells different from every other. At the 
<corroborees,> when they get to dancing and sweating, you'll see 
them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good 
smell. Idje, here", and he nodded at the man, "is said to have 
great odor. The stink is all the same to me, but I really think they 
can make one another out blindfolded".   "Here, Idje, you 
fella like tabac"? he said sharply. Idje still stared over our shoulders 
at the horizon. The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin 
I could understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.
It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the seventeenth 
century was a great period in Persian art. The architects, the tile 
and carpet makers, the potters, painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths 
worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich 
the city. Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by 
what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales 
and roses, cut by canals and terraced promenades, studded with 
water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening 
blue curves of a hundred domes. At the heart of all of this was the square, 
which one such traveler declared to be "as spacious, as pleasant 
and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe". In time Isfahan 
came to be known as "half the world", Isfahan <nisf-i-jahan>.
In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city, then the 
size of London, started to decline. The Afghans invaded; the Safavids 
fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached. 
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place, and now it is 
for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of 
old Persia and sometimes of the East. They think of it as a kind of 
spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.
Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky 
at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight. But even for them it 
remains a museum, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb, 
a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead. Everyone 
is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost no one is 
willing to acknowledge their present. It seems that for Persia, and 
especially for this city, there are only two times: the glorious past 
and the corrupt, depressing, sterile present. The one apparent connection 
between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other 
have survived and which naturally enough are called "historical monuments".
However, just as all the buildings have not fallen and 
flowed back to their original mud, so the values which wanted them 
and saw that they were built have not all disappeared. The values and 
talents which made the tile and the dome, the rug, the poem and the miniature, 
continue in certain social institutions which rise above the 
ordinary life of this city, as the great buildings rise above blank walls 
and dirty lanes. Often, too, the social institutions are housed 
in these pavilions and palaces and bridges, for these great structures 
are not simply "historical monuments"; they are the places where 
Persians live.   The promenade, for example, continues to take 
place on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees 
that now serves as the city's principal street. ?t takes place 
as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge, 
and also in the gardens of the square. On Fridays, the day when 
many Persians relax with poetry, talk, and a samovar, people do not, 
it is true, stream into Chehel Sotun- a pavilion and garden built 
by Shah Abbas /2, in the seventeenth century- but they do retire 
into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley, 
which are smaller, more humble copies of the former. And of course 
religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques, and commercial 
life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar. Those 
three other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the teahouse, 
and the <zur khaneh> (the latter a kind of club in which a leader 
and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics, 
dance, chanted poetry, and music), do not take place in buildings 
to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them occupy splendid 
examples of Persian domestic architecture: long, domed, chalk-white 
rooms with daises of turquoise tile, their end walls cut through 
to the orchards and the sky by open arches.   But more important, 
and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often 
do not see, is that these places and activities are often the settings 
in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities. 
Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the human form- these things 
are important to Persians, and they experience them with an intense 
and discriminating awareness.   I should like, by the way, to make 
it clear that I am not using the word "Persians" carelessly. 
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations, like 
a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool. These things 
are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to 
the most ordinary. The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's 
night are as often as not the <lutihaw,> mustachioed toughs 
who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons, brothels, 
and teahouses. A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord 
who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring 
famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor. Not long 
ago an acquaintance, a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw 
of the city, stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks. 
The air, he said, was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly 
good. I really didn't know what he meant. It was a nice day, 
granted. But <he> knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his 
lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.   The natural world 
then, plus poetry and some kinds of art, receives from the most ordinary 
of Persians a great deal of attention. The line of an eyebrow, 
the color of the skin, a ghazal from Hafiz, the purity of spring water, 
the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of 
a pavilion- these things are noticed, judged, and valued.   Nowhere 
in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so 
well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge. There has probably 
always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the 
city. For one thing, there is a natural belt of rock across the river 
bed; for another, it was here that one of the old caravan routes came 
in. It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans, 
and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah Abbas /2, 
in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick, tile, and stone, the present 
bridge. It is a splendid structure. From upstream it looks like a 
long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream, where the 
water level is much lower, it is a high, elaborately facaded pavilion.
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from 
each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile. At either end and 
in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed 
and capacious as church apses. Here, in the old days- when they 
had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and 
his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged 
in the smaller alcoves between.   Below, twenty vaults tunnel 
through the understructure of the bridge. These are traversed by 
another line of vaults, and thus rooms, arched on all four sides, are 
formed. Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing 
vista like a visual echo of piers and arches, while the vaults fronting 
upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and 
river pools. Here, on the hottest day, it is cool beneath the stone 
and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the 
vaults.   On the downstream, or "pavilion", side these vaults 
give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself. From the 
terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the 
water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river. 
Out of water, brick, and tile they have made far more than just a 
bridge.   On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops 
and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge. It 
is a great spectacle. The bridge itself rises up from the river, light-flared 
and enormous, like the outdoor set for an epic opera. Crowds 
press along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the arcades, 
massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege. All kinds 
come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering 
over a deal; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes 
who stand with the stillness of the blind, their eyes filmed with 
rheum and visions; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient 
limousines; students, civil servants, beggars, musicians, hawkers, 
and clowns. Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on 
carpets around a samovar. Below, people line the steps, as though on 
bleachers, to watch the sky and river. Above, in the tiled prosceniums 
of the alcoves, boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi, while at 
the very bottom, in the vaults, the toughs and blades of the city hoot 
and bang their drums, drink arak, play dice, and dance.   Here 
in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important 
to them: poetry, water, the moon, a beautiful face. To a stranger 
their delight in these things may seem paradoxical, for Persians chase 
the golden calf as much as any people. Many of them, moreover, are 
beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to 
ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant, the mullah, and the peasant. 
Nonetheless, they take time out- much time- from the game of 
grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks. 
Above all, they will stop in the middle of anything, anywhere, 
to hear or quote some poetry.   Poetry in Persian life is far 
more than a common ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by 
antagonisms- all may stand. It contains, in fact, their whole outlook 
on life. And it is expressed, at least to their taste, in a perfect 
form. Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty. 
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the 
libraries and museums. In Persia, where practically speaking there 
are no museums or libraries or, for that matter, hardly any books, the 
twins run free.   It is perhaps difficult to conceive, but imagine 
that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End 
will gather to sing Marlowe, Herrick, Shakespeare, and perhaps some 
lyrics of their own. That, at any rate, is what happens at the Khaju 
bridge. Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the 
top arcade. Here in these little rooms- or stages arched open to 
the sky and river- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they 
may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian 
music is divided. Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute- 
one inducing pleasure, another generosity, another love, and so 
on, to include all of the emotions. The singer simply matches the poem 
to a mode; for example, the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk 
poem: "<They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And 
Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains; Go, tell his aged mother 
that her son Fought with a thousand foes, and he was one>". 
Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet: "<Know 
ye, fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth, That 
here, with dust upon his eyes, Iraj, the sweet-tongued singer, lies. 
In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred> 
**h".   These songs (practically all Persian music, for 
that matter) are limited to a range of two octaves. Yet within this 
limitation there is an astonishing variety: design as intricate as 
that in the carpet or miniature, with the melodic line like the painted 
or woven line often flowing into an arabesque. 
<Die Frist ist um, und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr,> the 
Maestro quoted <The Flying Dutchman,> as he told of his career 
and wanderings, explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred 
in his life several times.   The music director of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra, William Steinberg, has molded his group 
into a prominent musical organization, which is his life. When he 
added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London 
Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958, he conducted one hundred fifty concerts 
within nine months, "commuting" between the two cities. This 
schedule became too strenuous, even for the energetic and conscientious 
Mr& Steinberg. His London contract was rescinded, and now, he 
explains cheerfully, as a bright smile lightens his intense, mobile face, 
"I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts"!   Our 
meeting took place in May, 1961, during one of the Maestro's stop-overs 
in New York, before he left for Europe. As we began to converse 
in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel, his restlessness and 
sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent. Seeking 
an obscure, dark, relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise 
suffused with afternoon sunshine, he asked if the soft background music 
could be turned off. Unfortunately, it was Muzak, which automatically 
is piped into the public rooms, and which <nolens volens> had to 
be endured. As he talked about himself, time and again stuffing and 
dragging on his pipe, Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried 
feeling grew faint and was dispelled.   Did he come from a musical 
family? Yes: though not professional musicians, they were a 
music-loving family. In his native Cologne, where his mother taught 
him to play the piano, he was able to read notes before he learned the 
alphabet. She even devised a system of colors, whereby the boy could 
easily distinguish the different note values. When he started school 
at the age of five-and-a-half, he could not understand why the alphabet 
begins with the letter ~A, instead of ~C, as in the scale. Because, 
like many other children, he intensely disliked practicing Czerny 
<Etudes,> he composed his own studies. When he was eight he began 
violin lessons. Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra, 
and during World War /1,, when musicians were scarce, he 
joined the opera orchestra as well. Steinberg claims that these early 
years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career. 
"By observing the conductor", he says with a twinkle in his 
eyes, "I learned how not to conduct".   The musician ran away 
from school when he was fifteen, but this escapade did not save him 
from the Gymnasium. Simultaneously, he pursued his musical studies 
at the conservatory, receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony, 
as well in the violin and piano. His professional career began when 
he was twenty; he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant 
at the Cologne Opera, and a year later was promoted to the position 
of regular conductor.   Wasn't this an unusually young age to 
fill such a responsible post? Yes, the Maestro assented.   Had 
he always wished to be a conductor? No, originally he had hoped 
to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such. However, 
when he assumed the duties of a conductor, he relinquished his career 
as a pianist.   Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera, 
after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky, teacher 
of Arnold Scho^nberg and Erich Korngold. In 1927 he succeeded 
Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague. 
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin 
State Opera. Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera, 
where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the 
rise of the Hitler regime. During these years the youthful conductor 
had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany. 
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's 
<Manon Lescaut> and de Falla's 
<La Vida Breve>. The Frankfurt 
years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's 
<Wozzek> soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber, 
and the world premiere of Scho^nberg's <Von heute auf morgen>. 
At the outset of his career, Steinberg had dedicated himself to the 
advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Scho^nberg work 
every year. In Frankfurt, too, he directed the Museum and Opera 
House concerts which, in addition to the standard repertoire, featured 
novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth 
Symphony.   Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 
1930's, 
Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish 
community. Through the Frankfurt Jewish <Kulturbund> he began 
to give sonata recitals in synagogues, with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann. 
As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional 
organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt <Kulturbund> 
Orchestra, which also gave guest performances in other German 
cities. In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin <Kulturbund>. 
In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin 
and Frankfurt <Kulturbund> orchestras joined under the combined efforts 
of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine 
Orchestra- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra- with 
Steinberg as founder-conductor.   In 1938, at the insistence 
of Arturo Toscanini, Steinberg left Germany for the United States, 
by way of Switzerland. After he had spent the first three years 
in New York as associate conductor, at Toscanini's invitation, of 
the ~NBC Orchestra, he made numerous guest appearances throughout 
the United States and Latin America. In 1945 he became conductor 
of the Buffalo Philharmonic. Seven years later he was asked to become 
director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. Since 1944 he has also conducted 
regularly at the San Francisco Opera, where he made his debut 
with a memorable performance of Verdi's <Falstaff>. In recent 
years he has traveled widely in Europe, conducting in Italy, France, 
Austria, and Switzerland. He returned to Germany for the first 
time in 1953, where he has since conducted in Cologne, Frankfurt, 
and Berlin.   Where in Europe was he going now?   First 
of all, to Italy for a short vacation- Forte dei Marmi, a place 
he loves. Since it is not far from Viareggio, he will visit Puccini's 
house, as he never fails to do, to pay his respects to the memory 
of the composer of <La Boheme,> which he considers one of Puccini's 
masterpieces. Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about 
Italy: "Rome is my second home. I consider it the center of the 
world and make it a point to be there once a year". He will conduct 
two concerts at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, as well as concerts 
in Munich and Cologne. "Then I return to the United States 
for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia", he 
added.   The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to 
be of unusual interest. There will be premieres of new works, made possible 
through Ford Foundation commissions: Carlisle Floyd's <Mystery,> 
with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist. Other world premieres 
will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's 
<Samba Concertante>.   "And next year we will do- also 
a Ford commission- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter, with Jacob 
Lateiner as soloist. Of course, I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner 
works in the coming season, as usual. We'll play Bruckner's 
Fifth Symphony in the original version, and Mahler's Seventh- 
the least accessible, known, and played of Mahler's works. My Pittsburghers 
have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner".
He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters 
on tour, especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies, and 
<Das Lied von der Erde,> and Bruckner's Sixth- which is rarely 
played- and Seventh. Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as "my 
travel symphony". He recalled that in California after a critic 
had attacked him for "still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans", 
the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.
"Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and 
my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us, I am probably 
the only one- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein- 
who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner 
and Mahler".   Since he introduces so much modern music, 
I could not resist asking how he felt about it.   "There was 
always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era 
in which it was created. But I usually stick to the old phrase: 
<'Ich habe ein Amt, aber keine Meinung> (I hold an office, but 
I do not feel entitled to have an opinion). I consider it to be my 
job to expose the public to what is being written today".   With 
all his musical activities, did he have the time and inclination to 
do anything else? He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection 
to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals. 
He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain, 
but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able 
to see in Paris a year ago.   And how did he feel about modern 
art? Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he 
was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments. "As my wife puts 
it", he said, again with a twinkle in his eyes, "all you know is 
your music. But after all, you never learned anything else"!
What did he do for relaxation? Like his late colleague, Mitropoulos, 
he reads mystery stories, in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature.
But his prime interest, apart from music, he insisted seriously, was 
his family- his wife, daughter and son. At the moment he was excited 
about his son's having received the Prix de Rome in archaeology 
and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation 
of an Etruscan tomb. "Both children are musical and my wife is 
a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment". 
"IS the attitude of German youth comparable to that of "the 
angry 
young men' of England"? was the topic for a round-table discussion 
at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich.   I was chairman, 
the only not youthful participant. Since attack serves to stimulate 
interest in broadcasts, I added to my opening statement a sentence in 
which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which 
is a necessary ingredient of anger, and might be classified as uninterested 
and bored rather than angry. I was far from convinced of the 
truth of my statement, but could not think of anything that might evoke 
responses more quickly.   "It is easy for you to talk"; 
countered a twenty year old law student, "you travel around the world. 
We would like to do that too".   "But you want a job guaranteed 
when you return", I continued my attack. "You must have 
some security", said a young clerk.   When I mentioned that 
for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return 
fare, but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount, 
the young people looked at me doubtingly. One girl expressed what was 
obviously in their minds.   "Would you advise us to act the 
same way? You might have failed. I think it is rather foolhardy to 
trust to luck".   Others mentioned that I might have had to 
ask 
friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign 
country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international 
understanding.   The debate needed no additional controversy 
and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life, what 
his hopes were and what his fears.   Though the four boys and 
two girls, the youngest nineteen years of age, the oldest twenty-four, 
came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal 
interests, there was surprising agreement among them. What they 
wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political 
instability in their own country.   The ideal home, they 
agreed, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to 
five rooms, just enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and 
two children. No one wanted a larger family or no children, and none 
hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would 
be satisfactory.   All expressed interest in world affairs 
but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest. 
##
ONCE again, as in the days of the Founding Fathers, America 
faces a stern test. That test, as President Kennedy forthrightly 
depicted it in his State of the Union message, will determine "whether 
a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure".
It is well then that in this hour both of "national peril" 
and of "national opportunity" we can take counsel with the men who 
made the nation. Incapable of self-delusion, the Founding Fathers 
found the crisis of their time to be equally grave, and yet they had 
confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free 
peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.
Seven Founders- George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, 
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James 
Madison and John Jay- determined the destinies of the new nation. 
In certain respects, their task was incomparably greater than ours today, 
for there was nobody before them to show them the way. As Madison 
commented to Jefferson in 1789, "We are in a wilderness without 
a single footstep to guide us. Our successors will have an easier task".
They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words, 
as "the Argonauts" who had lived in "the Heroic Age". Accordingly, 
they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential 
sources for posterity. Their writings assume more than dramatic or 
patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in 
which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but, rather, 
as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen, 
that "with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved".
Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point 
of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven were essentially 
congenial minds, and their agreements with each other were more consequential 
than their differences. Even though in most cases the completion 
of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off, 
enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing 
a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual 
feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember 
that their separate careers were extraordinary. Certainly no other 
seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in 
so concentrated a span of years.   Eldest of the seven, Benjamin 
Franklin, a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the 
most dazzling success story in our history. The young printer's apprentice 
achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields, as editor 
and publisher, scientist, inventor, philanthropist and statesman. 
Author of the Albany Plan of Union, which, had it been adopted, might 
have avoided the Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line 
battles in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and 
the peace that ended the war, headed the state government of Pennsylvania, 
and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal 
Convention. ##
ON a military mission for his native Virginia 
the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian 
War, then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia. 
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution, 
he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory. Retiring 
to his beloved Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal 
Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected 
President. During his two terms the Constitution was tested and 
found workable, strong national policies were inaugurated, and the 
traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed. 
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology, wrote 
the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts, negotiated, 
with Franklin and Jay, the peace with Britain and served as our first 
Vice President and our second President. ##
HIS political 
opponent and lifetime friend, Thomas Jefferson, achieved immortality 
through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, but 
equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted 
in his native Virginia, his role as father of our territorial system, 
and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first 
term as President.   During the greater part of Jefferson's 
career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian, James 
Madison, eight years his junior. The active sponsor of Jefferson's 
measure for religious liberty in Virginia, Madison played the most 
influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in 
securing its ratification in Virginia, founded the first political 
party in American history, and, as Jefferson's Secretary of State 
and his successor in the Presidency, guided the nation through the 
troubled years of our second war with Britain.   If Franklin was 
an authentic genius, then Alexander Hamilton, with his exceptional 
precocity, consuming energy, and high ambition, was a political prodigy. 
His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was only 19, quickly 
brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders. Principal author 
of "The Federalist", he swung New York over from opposition 
to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly. His 
collaboration with Washington, begun when he was the general's aide 
during the Revolution, was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet 
as Secretary of the Treasury. His bold fiscal program and his broad 
interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions. 
##
LESS dazzling than Hamilton, less eloquent than Jefferson, 
John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers. 
He served as president of the Continental Congress. He played 
the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that 
ended the Revolution, and directed America's foreign affairs throughout 
the Confederation period. As first Chief Justice, his strong 
nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall. He ended his public 
career as a two-term governor of New York.   These Seven Founders 
constituted an intellectual and social elite, the most respectable 
and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed. Their 
social status was achieved in some cases by birth, as with Washington, 
Jefferson and Jay; in others by business and professional acumen, 
as with Franklin and Adams, or, in Hamilton's case, by an influential 
marriage. Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals 
in underdeveloped nations of our own day, they commanded both prestige 
and influence before the Revolution started.   As different 
physically as the tall, angular Jefferson was from the chubby, rotund 
Adams, the seven were striking individualists. Ardent, opinionated, 
even obstinate, they were amazingly articulate, wrote their own copy, 
and were masters of phrasemaking. ##
CAPABLE of enduring friendships, 
they were also stout controversialists, who could write with 
a drop of vitriol on their pens. John Adams dismissed John Dickinson, 
who voted against the Declaration of Independence, as "a certain 
great fortune and piddling genius". Washington castigated his 
critic, General Conway, as being capable of "all the meanness of intrigue 
to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity". And 
Hamilton, who felt it "a religious duty" to oppose Aaron Burr's 
political ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk had 
he shown more literary restraint.   The Seven Founders were 
completely dedicated to the public service. Madison once remarked: 
"My life has been so much a public one", a comment which fits the 
careers of the other six. Franklin retired from editing and publishing 
at the age of 42, and for the next forty-two years devoted himself 
to public, scientific, and philanthropic interests. Washington never 
had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved 
best, plantation management. He served as Commander in Chief during 
the Revolution without compensation. ##
JOHN ADAMS took 
to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley, 
to "pursue the study of the law, rather than the gain of it". In 
taking account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded 
that "no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did" 
and "for so little profit". When the Revolution broke out, he, along 
with Jefferson and Jay, abandoned his career at the bar, with considerable 
financial sacrifice.   Hamilton, poorest of the seven, 
gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet. 
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of 
the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends. 
"If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars", he wrote 
one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury.   To 
support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell 
of public service. Talleyrand passed his New York law office one 
night on the way to a party. Hamilton was bent over his desk, drafting 
a legal paper by the light of a candle. The Frenchman was astonished. 
"I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune 
of his country, but now is working all night in order to support his 
family", he reflected. ##
ALL seven combined ardent devotion 
to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality. John 
Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of 
Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their 
charters, the British Constitution and the common law, and Jefferson 
appealed in the Declaration of Independence "to the tribunal of 
the world" for support of a revolution justified by "the laws of 
nature and of nature's God".   They fought hard, but they were 
forgiving to former foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures 
from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 
1783.   This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified 
in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee, 
Peter Van Schaack. Jay had participated in the decision that exiled 
his old friend Van Schaack. Yet when, at war's end, the ex-Tory 
made the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote him from 
Paris, where he was negotiating the peace settlement: 
"As 
an independent American I considered all who were not for us, and you 
amongst the rest, as against us, yet be assured that John Jay never 
ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack".   The latter 
in turn assured him that "were I arraigned at the bar, and you my 
judge, I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause".
All seven recognized that independence was but the first 
step toward building a nation. "We have now a national character 
to establish", Washington wrote in 1783. "Think continentally", 
Hamilton counseled the young nation. This new force, love of country, 
super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's 
own state, was epitomized by Washington. His first inaugural 
address speaks of "my country whose voice I can never hear but with 
veneration and love".   All sought the fruition of that nationalism 
in a Federal Government with substantial powers. Save Jefferson, 
all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal 
Constitution. They supported it, not as a perfect instrument, but as 
the best obtainable. Historians have traditionally regarded the great 
debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized 
vs& limited government, with Hamilton and the nationalists 
supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter 
position. ##
THE state's rights position was formulated by 
Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves, but 
in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better 
Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians. In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson 
had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution, 
and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's 
bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception, and in 
adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff. Indeed, the old Jeffersonians 
were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they 
were to the Jacksonian Democrats. ##
WHEN, in 1832, the South 
Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition 
which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited 
no encouragement from that senior statesman. In his political testament, 
"Advice to My Country", penned just before his death, Madison 
expressed the wish "that the Union of the States be cherished 
and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora 
with her box opened; and the disguised one, as the serpent creeping 
with his deadly wiles into Paradise". 
#TOBACCO ROAD IS DEAD. LONG LIVE TOBACCO ROAD.#
Nostalgic Yankee 
readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians 
that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway, over 
which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the 
Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop. Thus we are compelled 
to face the urbanization of the South- an urbanization which, despite 
its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture, 
has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers. Indeed, it 
seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road, 
with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint 
juleps, continue to live- but only as a weary, overexploited phantom.
Those writers known collectively as the "Southern school" 
have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize; 
according to many critics, in fact, the South has led the North 
in literature since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren 
have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum 
renaissance. It is interesting, however, that despite this 
strong upsurge in Southern writing, almost none of the writers has 
forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel 
sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the 
season's cotton and tobacco crops; of the stereotyped Negro servants 
chanting hymns as they plow the fields; of these and a host of 
other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps 
of the past century. This is not to say that the South is no longer 
agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification. 
But the South is, and has been for the past century, engaged 
in a wide-sweeping urbanization which, oddly enough, is not reflected 
in its literature.   In 1900 the South was only 15% urban; 
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban. In a mere half-century the South 
has more than tripled its urban status. There is a New South emerging, 
a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with 
the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades. As 
the New South snowballs toward further urbanization, it becomes more 
and more homogeneous with the North- a tendency which Willard 
Thorp terms "Yankeefication", as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte, 
Birmingham, and Houston. It is said that, even at the present 
stage of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly 
unlike Columbus or Trenton. Undoubtedly even the old Southern 
stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind: William Styron mentions 
in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder, a Civil 
War general, now renamed, in typical California fashion, "Buena 
Vista Terrace". The effects of television and other mass media 
are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force. 
As for progress, the "backward South" can boast of Baton Rouge, 
which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred 
and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second largest growth of the period 
for all cities over 25,000.   The field, then, is ripe for 
new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century 
phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication: the new urban economy, 
the city-dweller, the pains of transition, the labor problems; the 
list is, obviously, endless. But these sources have not been tapped. 
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism, exaggerating 
the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque, but 
as unreal as- or even <more> unreal than- yesterday. William 
Styron, while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance, 
insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and 
yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes. 
Even the great god Faulkner, the South's one probable contender 
for literary immortality, has little concerned himself with these matters; 
such are simply not within his bounded province.   Where 
are the writers to treat these changes? Has the agrarian tradition 
become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded 
or unwanted? Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the 
older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated 
testings over the decades. Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to 
write of a <new> economy, these writers seem to be contenting themselves 
with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.
An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region 
may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in 
the white-dominated society, a problem that has been reflected in regional 
fiction especially since 1865. Today the Negro must discover his 
role in an <industrialized> South, which indicates that the racial 
aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically, but rather 
has gradually come to be reflected in this new context, this new coat 
of paint. The Negro faces as much, if not more, difficulty in fitting 
himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one. This 
represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem. But there 
have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins, the picket lines, 
the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago. 
Today's evidence, such as the fact that only three Southern states 
(South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi) still openly defy integration, 
would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness.
Other examples of <gradual> changes that have 
affected the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the busses; 
his requesting, and often getting, higher wages, better working conditions, 
better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before 
the Supreme Court decision of 1954. Then came this decision, which 
sped the process of gaining equality (or perhaps hindered it; only 
historical evolution will determine which): an <abrupt> change.
Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led 
to an ironically anarchical rebellion. He has frequently refused to move 
from white lunch counters, refused to obey <local> laws which he 
considers unjust, while in other cases he has appealed to <federal> 
laws. This bold self-assertion, after decades of humble subservience, 
is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon, an abrupt change in the Southern 
way of existence. A new order is thrusting itself into being. 
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation, 
uncertainty, and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role 
in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white 
man.   The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern 
fiction. It is clear that, while most writers enjoy picturing 
the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble old agrarian who mutters "yassuhs" 
and "sho' nufs" with blissful deference to his white employer 
(or, in Old South terms, "massuh"), this stereotype is doomed 
to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester. While 
there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through 
the rural South, such men appear to be a vanishing breed. Writers 
openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man; 
but they obviously mean by this, not a Negro personality, but a Negro 
<type>. Presenting an individualized Negro character, it would 
seem, is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could 
tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is, as suggested above, 
glaringly rare.   Just as the Negro situation points up the 
gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life, it also points up 
the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature. The book 
concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed; 
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel, <Peaceable Lane>, has 
openly faced the problem.   All but the most rabid of Confederate 
flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in 
actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance 
of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid 
ante-bellum way of life. Many earlier writers, mourning the demise 
of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate this "gracious 
Old South" imagery, creating such lasting impressions as Margaret 
Mitchell's 
"Tara" plantation. Modern writers, who are supposed 
to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist 
upon drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when it well deserves 
a rest after the overexploitation of the past century. Perhaps 
these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but 
they can hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama is dead. 
As John T& Westbrook says in his article, "Twilight of Southern 
Regionalism" (<Southwest Review>, Winter 1957): "**h 
The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South, already too minutely 
autopsied in prose and poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever 
dead and (let us fervently hope) forever done with".   Westbrook 
further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image 
of their homeland, which is too readily assimilated by both foreign 
readers and visiting Yankees: "Our northerner is suspicious of 
all this crass evidence [of urbanization] presented to his senses. 
It bewilders and befuddles him. He is too deeply steeped in William 
Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren. The fumes of progress are in his 
nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes, but his 
heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night 
riders. On this trip to the South he wants, above all else, to sniff 
the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at 
least one barn burn at midnight". Obviously, such a Northern tourist's 
purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland: 
he <wants> to see a world of make-believe.   In the 
meantime, while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization 
that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee, Southern writers 
have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's 
progress. Willard Thorp, in his new book <American Writing in 
the Twentieth Century>, observes, quite validly it seems: "**h 
Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched. 
No southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what 
Herrick, Dreiser, and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did 
for New York **h There are almost no fictional treatments of the 
industrialized south". Not a single Southern author, major or minor, 
has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material.
Faulkner, for one, appears to be safe from the accusing 
fingers of all assailants in this regard. Faulkner culminates the 
Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been, or could 
ever be, done. He has made it his, and his it remains, irrevocably. 
He treats it with a mythological, universal application.   As 
his disciples boast, even though his emphasis is elsewhere, Faulkner 
does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly, 
as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes 
families. Even two decades ago in <Go Down, Moses> Faulkner 
was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through 
its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the 
curse of slavery erased from its soil. Yet his concern even here is 
with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general, and he never 
deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial 
impact.   Faulkner traces, in his vast and overpowering saga 
of Yoknapatawpha County, the gradual changes which seep into the 
South, building layer upon layer of minute, subtle innovation which eventually 
tend largely to hide the Old Way. Thus Faulkner reminds 
us, and wisely, that the "new" South has gradually evolved out of 
the Old South, and consequently its agrarian roots persist. Yet he 
presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers 
if not himself: the problems with which a New South must grapple 
in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization. 
With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of 
six men: a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil. The 
thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with 
even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually 
surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.
Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual 
devices of the theatre. Most avant-garde creators, true to their 
interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement, have tended to dress 
their dancers in simple lines and solid colors (often black) and to 
give them a bare cyclorama for a setting. But Robert Rauschenberg, 
the neo-dadaist artist, has collaborated with several of them. He has 
designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white 
for Mr& Cunningham's <Summerspace>, so that dancers and background 
merge into a shimmering unity. For Mr& Taylor's <Images 
and Reflections> he made some diaphanous tents that alternately 
hide and reveal the performer, and a girl's cape lined with grass. Mr& 
Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume 
and decor. In fact, he calls his productions dance-theatre works 
of motion, shape, light, and sound. To raise the dancer out of his personal, 
pedestrian self, Mr& Nikolais has experimented with relating 
him to a larger, environmental orbit. He began with masks to make 
the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be. He 
went on to use objects- hoops, poles, capes- which he employed as 
extensions of the body of the dancer, who moved with them. The depersonalization 
continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play 
of lights upon his figure. In each case, the object, the color, even 
the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become 
part of the theatrical being of the performer. The dancer who never 
loosens her hold on a parasol, begins to feel that it is part of herself. 
Or, clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of 
hoops, the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a "finial". 
As the dancer is depersonalized, his accouterments are animized, 
and the combined elements give birth to a new being. From this being 
come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single 
unit.   Thus, the avant-garde choreographers have extended the 
scope of materials available for dance composition. But, since they 
have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity, how are they 
to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal? Some 
look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply 
corresponding methods to their own work. Others, less consciously 
but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times, experiment 
with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet, painter, 
and musician.   An approach that has appealed to some choreographers 
is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process 
of projective verse: "one perception must immediately and directly 
lead to a further perception". The creator trusts his intuition to 
lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors 
the reality of his experience. He disdains external restrictions- conventional 
syntax, traditional metre. The unit of form is determined 
subjectively: "the Heart, by the way of the Breath, to the Line". 
The test of form is fidelity to the experience, a gauge also accepted 
by the abstract expressionist painters.   An earlier but 
still influential school of painting, surrealism, had suggested the way 
of dealing with the dream experience, that event in which seemingly 
incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations 
of the subconscious. The resulting picture might appear a maze of 
restless confusions and contradictions, but it is more true to life than 
a portrait of an artificially contrived order. The contemporary painter 
tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but 
their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines, colors, masses, 
and energies. He is still concerned, however, with a personal event. 
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence 
of the vitality of the experience of creation. The work must 
be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.
Some painters have less interest in the experience of the 
moment, with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities, than in looking 
beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher, more serene level 
of truth. Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations 
they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design, which symbolize 
an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world. The 
concept remains subjective. But in this approach it is the artist's 
ultimate insight, rather than his immediate impressions, that gives 
form to the work.   Others look to more objective devices of 
order. The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes 
a mathematical system of rotations that, once set in motion, 
determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities. 
The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of 
intervals (or rhythms or dynamic changes). He may even alter the pattern 
by applying a scheme of random numbers. But he cannot order his 
elements by will, either rational or inspired. The system works as an 
impersonal mechanism. Musicians who use the chance method also exclude 
subjective control of formal development. Again, the composer must 
select his own materials. But a tossing of coins, with perhaps the added 
safeguard of reference to the oracles of the <I Ching>, the Chinese 
Book of Changes, dictates the handling of the chosen materials.
Avant-garde choreographers, seeking new forms of continuity 
for their new vocabulary of movements, have turned to similar approaches. 
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation. 
According to Katherine Litz, "the becoming, the process of realization, 
is the dance". The process stipulates that the choreographer 
sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that 
he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it. The sequence 
may involve a sharp contrast: for example, a quiet meditative sway 
of the body succeeded by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle 
distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged, 
its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified, or it may be transferred 
to become a movement of only the arms or the head. Even the least 
alteration will change the quality. An exploration of these possible 
relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form 
to the dance.   The approach to the depiction of the experience 
of creation may be analytic, as it is for Miss Litz, or spontaneous, 
as it is for Merle Marsicano. She, too, is concerned with "the 
becoming, the process of realization", but she does not think in 
terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns. The design 
is determined emotionally: "I must reach into myself for the spring 
that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event 
with which the dance confronts me". Looking back, Miss Marsicano 
feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock. 
At one time she felt impelled to make dances that "moved all 
over the stage", much as Pollock's paintings move violently over 
the full extent of the canvas. But her conscious need was to break away 
from constricting patterns of form, a need to let the experience shape 
itself.   Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity 
that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement. It 
may be a free front-back swing of the leg, leading to a sideways swing 
of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off 
from the ground. This became a dance called <Prelude to Flight>. 
A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close 
to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal 
emotion. He seeks to make his dancers more "godlike" by relating 
them to the impersonal elements of shape, light color, and sound. If 
his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures 
from Mars, this is consistent with his intention of placing them in 
the orbit of another world, a world in which they are freed of their 
pedestrian identities. It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the 
germ of form is discovered. In his recognition of his impersonal self 
the dancer moves, and this self, in the "first revealed stroke of 
its existence", states the theme from which all else must follow. The 
theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve. 
It may be a reaction to a percussive sound, the following movements 
constituting further reactions. It may establish the relation of the 
figure of the dancer to light and color, in which case changes in the 
light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs. Unconcerned 
with the practical function of his actions, the dancer is engrossed 
exclusively in their "motional content". Movements unfold freely 
because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive. 
But the metamorphosis must come first.   Though he is also concerned 
with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity, Merce 
Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim. 
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity, any line of action 
related to the concept of cause and effect. He bases his approach 
on the belief that anything can follow anything. An order can be chanced 
rather than chosen, and this approach produces an experience that 
is "free and discovered rather than bound and remembered". Thus, 
there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance 
but in the shape of their continuity as well. Chance, he finds, enables 
him to create "a world beyond imagination". He cites with pleasure 
the comment of a lady, who exclaimed after a concert: "Why, 
it's extremely interesting. But I would never have thought of it myself".
The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is 
unlike any sequence to be seen in life. At one side of the stage a dancer 
jumps excitedly; nearby, another sits motionless, while still another 
is twirling an umbrella. A man and a girl happen to meet; they 
look straight at the audience, not at each other. He lifts her, puts 
her down, and walks off, neither pleased nor disturbed, as if nothing 
had happened. If one dancer slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette, 
sit down, or offer his assailant a fork and spoon. Events occur 
without apparent reason. Their consequences are irrelevant- or there 
are no consequences at all.   The sequence is determined by 
chance, and Mr& Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance 
devices. He may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab 
bag. The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal 
organization of the dance but also its spatial design, special 
slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be 
performed. The other variables include the dancer who is to perform 
the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance. 
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the 
movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and the approximate 
total duration of the dance. The "approximate" is important, because 
even after the order of the work has been established by the chance 
method, the result is not inviolable. Each performance may be different. 
If a work is divided into several large segments, a last-minute 
drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for 
any particular performance. And any sequence can not only change its 
positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.
Mr& Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he 
adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can. However, there is always 
the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible 
to execute. Then the choreographer must arbitrate. He must 
rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other. 
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone 
one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation 
for the leap.
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH were in greater agreement on sovereignty, 
through all their dispute about it, than were the Founding Fathers. 
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen 
of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun, and defended in the end 
by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee. The people everywhere 
had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles, in 
understanding of and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their 
Union. Repeated efforts- beginning with the Missouri Compromise 
of 1821- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas 
to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise, rather than clear 
thought and timely action. Even so, confusion in this period gained 
such strength (from compromise and other factors) that it led to the 
bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century. Nothing can show more than 
this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in 
even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.
The present issue in Atlantica- whether to transform an 
alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens- 
resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that 
was resolved by Civil War. And so I would only touch upon it now 
(much as I have long wanted to write a book about it). I think it is 
essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts 
of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better 
how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse 
confusion on this subject.   The difference came down to this: 
The Southern States insisted that the United States was, in last 
analysis, what its name implied- a Union of States. To their leaders 
the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign 
states, who therefore retained the right to secede from it. This right 
of the State, its upholders contended, was essential to maintain 
the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger 
of centralizing power in the Union government. The champions of 
the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, 
the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign 
citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right 
to secede, though the citizens could. Writing to Speed on August 
24, 1855, Lincoln made the latter point clear. In homely terms whose 
timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to secede. 
"  We began by declaring that <all men are created equal>. 
We now practically read it, <all men are created equal except negroes>. 
When the Know-nothings get control, it will read, <All 
men 
are created equal except negroes> and foreigners and Catholics. When 
it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where 
they make no pretence of loving liberty- to Russia, for instance, where 
despotism can be taken pure, without the base alloy of hypocrisy". 
[His emphasis]   When the Southern States exercised 
their "right to secede", they formed what they officially styled "The 
Confederate States of America". Dictionaries, as we have 
seen, still cite this government, along with the Articles of Confederation 
of 1781, as an example of a confederacy. The fact is that the 
Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as 
the Federal Constitution did. The Confederate Constitution copied 
much of the Federal Constitution verbatim, and most of the rest in 
substance. It operated on, by and for the people individually just as 
did the Federal Constitution. It made substantially the same division 
of power between the central and state governments, and among the 
executive, legislative and judicial branches. 
#THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
CONFEDERACY AND FEDERAL UNION IN 1861#
Many believe- and understandably- 
that the great difference between the Constitution of 
the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the 
former recognized the right of each state to secede. But though each 
of its members had asserted this right against the Union, the final 
Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11- nearly a month 
before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing 
a state to secede. Its drafters discussed this vital point but 
left it out of their Constitution. Their President, Jefferson Davis, 
interpreted their Constitution to mean that it "admits of no coerced 
association", but this reremained so doubtful that "there were 
frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution".
The Constitution of the Southern "Confederation" 
differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects: 
It openly, defiantly, recognized slavery- an institution 
which the Southerners of 1787, even though they continued it, found so 
impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning 
the word in the Federal Constitution. They recognized that 
slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest, and that 
to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive 
contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in 
the Declaration of 1776 that "all men are created equal, that they 
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among 
them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness **h". The 
other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the 
President of the Confederacy held office for six (instead of four) 
years, and was limited to one term.   These are not, however, differences 
in federal structure. The only important differences from that 
standpoint, between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles. 
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people 
were acting through their states, whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 
expressed, as clearly as language can, the opposite concept, that they 
were acting directly as citizens. Here are the two Preambles: _FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTION, 1789_ "we the People of the United States, 
in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure 
domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence, promote the general 
Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and 
our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America". _CONFEDERATE CONSTITUTION, 1861_ "We 
the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its 
sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal 
government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure 
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking 
the favor and the guidance of Almighty God- do ordain and establish 
this Constitution for the Confederate States of America".
One is tempted to say that, on the difference between the concepts 
of sovereignty in these two preambles, the worst war of the Nineteenth 
century was fought. But though the Southern States, when drafting 
a constitution to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this 
fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede, the fact remained 
that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept 
that it was composed primarily of sovereign states. If the Union 
conceded this to them, the same right must be conceded to each remaining 
state whenever it saw fit to secede: This would destroy the federal 
balance between it and the states, and in the end sacrifice to 
the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained 
by their Union.   Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the 
issue for the Union a vital one: Whether it was a Union of sovereign 
citizens that should continue to live, or an association of sovereign 
states that must fall prey either to "anarchy or despotism".
Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always willing to 
concede to each "slave state" the right to decide independently whether 
to continue or end it. Though his election was interpreted by 
many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal 
balance in favor of the Union, Lincoln himself proposed no such change 
in the rights the Constitution gave the states. After the war began, 
he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action 
even in the Border States that stayed with the Union. He issued 
his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left 
him no other way to save the Union. In his Message of December 
2, 1862, he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which I 
would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union: <"In giving 
freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free">.   What 
Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people 
were sovereign in the Union. He fought to the end to preserve it 
as a "government of the people, by the people, for the people". 
#THE 
TRUTH ON EACH SIDE WON IN THE CIVIL WAR#
The fact that the Americans 
who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to 
keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis 
of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer, and the greater. 
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged, in the South as in the North, 
as America's true sovereign, in "a new birth of freedom", as 
Lincoln promised. But before this came about, 214,938 Americans had 
given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights 
of men and of states.   On their decisive battlefield Lincoln 
did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the "brave 
men, living and dead, who fought here". He understood that both 
sides were at fault, and he reached the height of saying so explicitly 
in his Second Inaugural.   To my knowledge, Lincoln remains 
the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who, while fighting 
a fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough to say this 
publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human 
truth there is some error, and in all our error, some truth. So great 
a man could not but understand, too, that the thing that moves men to 
sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought, which their 
opponents see and attack, but the truth which the latter do not see- 
any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves 
defend.   It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day 
to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives 
in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had 
delegated to the States and to their Union. They differed in the 
balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen- 
but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental 
truth: That individual life, liberty and happiness depend 
on a right balance between the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty, 
in all its aspects, which this involves. The 140,414 Americans 
who gave "the last full measure of devotion" to prevent disunion, 
preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers 
of anarchy, inherent in confederations, which throughout history have 
proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign 
states, and to the liberties of their people. But the fact that 
70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing 
concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways.
Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing 
the Southerners their right to have slaves- a right that was even 
less compatible with the sovereignty of man. The very fact that they 
came so near to winning by the wrong method, war, led directly to their 
losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for, since it forced 
Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure. There was 
a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another. There was also a 
lesson, one that has served ever since to keep Americans, in their conflicts 
with one another, from turning from the ballot to the bullet. 
Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case, 
they did not lose the truth they fought for. The lives so many of them 
gave, to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment 
by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued 
ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe. 
As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new "unnatural" and 
internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with 
the entropy-increasing properties of the external world. The useful 
suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a 
third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with 
our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique 
for building protective artificial environments. One wonders 
about its applicability to people. Will advances in human sciences help 
us build social structures and governments which will enable us to 
cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein 
and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to 
adapt to a sea of molecular interaction? The answer is of course yes. 
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit, composed 
of people, which gives us both some immunity from, and a way of dealing 
with, other people. Social invention did not have to await social 
theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier 
or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes. 
But it has been during the last two centuries, during the scientific 
revolution, that our independence from the physical environment has 
made the most rapid strides. We have ample light when the sun sets; 
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly 
through the air, although gravity pulls us down; the range of our 
voice ignores distance. At what stage are social sciences then? Is 
the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time 
of Newton? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion 
of cause in Copernicus and in Freud. And it is certainly no slight 
to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.
Political theoretical understanding, although almost at a standstill 
during this century, did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries, and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased 
the possibility for man to coexist with man. Consitutional government, 
popular vote, trial by jury, public education, labor unions, cooperatives, 
communes, socialized ownership, world courts, and the veto 
power in world councils are but a few examples. Most of these, with 
horrible exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an attempt to 
quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny its force, but as a means to 
survive and enjoy it. The most effective political inventions seem to 
make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters 
can play only a minor part in the whole scheme. Just as present 
technology had to await the explanations of physics, so one might 
expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding. 
We are desperately in the need of such invention, for man is 
still very much at the mercy of man. In fact the accumulation of the 
hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other. 
#/3,#
I want, therefore, to discuss a second and quite different 
fruit of science, the connection between scientific understanding 
and fear. There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human 
sciences which in themselves and even without political invention 
can help to dispel our present fears. Lucretius has remarked: "The 
reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all 
sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause, 
and these they attribute to the will of God". Perhaps things 
were even worse then. It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears 
of man. We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and 
from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people 
now than man ever was. We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in 
the same way that people once feared comets. The bombs are as harmless 
as an automobile in a garage. We are worried about what people may 
do with them- that some crazy fool may "push the button". 
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human 
fears, but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific 
explanations that stand out quite clearly. They are in general 
those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual. 
They include both individual fears and collective ones. They arise 
in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not 
only on the external world, but also on the precise pattern of behavior 
of the individual or group. Often it is recognized that all the details 
of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but, because 
the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical 
understanding, one is never quite certain which behavior elements 
are effective, and the whole pattern becomes ritualized. Yet often 
fear persists because, even with the most rigid ritual, one is never 
quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or 
that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive 
act. To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates 
the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much 
of magic and superstition. But a somewhat more detailed analysis 
of this process may be illuminating.   The frequently postulated 
antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness 
apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize. 
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly 
cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people 
to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice. This and other 
fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually, first, with the 
Ptolemaic 
system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then, more 
firmly, with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could 
account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions. 
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one 
can eliminate fear without instituting any controls. In fact, although 
we have dispelled the fear, we have not necessarily assured ourselves 
that there are no dangers. There is still the remote possibility 
of planetoid collision. A meteor could fall on San Francisco. Solar 
activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought. 
Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our 
former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which, in this case, 
amounts to doing nothing. Yet we no longer feel uneasy. This almost 
trivial example is nevertheless suggestive, for there are some elements 
in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter 
and shorter and our present fear of war. We, in our country, think 
of war as an external threat which, if it occurs, will not be primarily 
of our own doing. And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance 
of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way 
on the details of how we behave. What elements of our behavior are decisive? 
Our weapons production, our world prestige, our ideas of democracy, 
our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage? 
We have staved off a war and, since our behavior has involved all 
these elements, we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring 
to abandon any part of it, since we have not the slightest notion which 
parts are effective.   I think that we are here also talking of 
the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching 
at night along the streets of a large city. If an automobile 
were approaching him, he would know what was required of him, even though 
he might not be able to act quickly enough. With the group of boys 
it is different. He does not know whether to look up or look aside, 
to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side, to cross 
the street, or to continue on the same side. When confronted with 
a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them 
might do to me or to himself or to others. I believe that what I do 
has some effect on his actions and I have learned, in a way, to commune 
with drunks, but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly 
the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment 
in physics. I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some 
unwitting slip all hell may break loose. Our inability to explain 
why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of 
ritual and malaise. We are forced, in our behavior towards others, to 
adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a 
minimal understanding of their essential elements.   Our collective 
policies, group and national, are similarly based on voodoo, but 
here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still 
engaged in determing them. We use terms from our personal experience 
with individuals such as "trust", "cheat", and "get tough". 
We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus 
talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles. We 
perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually 
no understanding of social cause and effect. Small wonder, then, 
that we fear.   The achievements which dispelled our fears of 
the cosmos took place three centuries ago. What additional roles has 
the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played? 
In the physical sciences, these achievements concern electricity, chemistry, 
and atomic physics. In the life sciences, there has been an 
enormous increase in our understanding of disease, in the mechanisms of 
heredity, and in bio- and physiological chemistry. The major effect 
of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the 
industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding 
has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment. In 
addition, our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also 
changed. Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding 
is still lacking, but where some explanations are possible, as with 
lightning and weather and earthquakes, the appropriate kind of human action 
has been more adequately indicated.   Apparently the population 
as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations 
of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears. How and 
why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject 
for study. In some areas, the progress is slower than in others. In 
agriculture, for example, despite the advances in biology, elaborate 
rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence 
of some natural disaster. In child care, the opposite extreme prevails; 
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds 
anything warranted by established psychological theory. There are 
many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite 
appropriate reduction in ritual and fear. Much of the former extreme 
uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death 
has disappeared. The persistent horror of having a malformed child 
has, I believe, been reduced, not because we have gained any control 
over this misfortune, but precisely because we have learned that we 
have so little control over it. In fact, the recent warnings about the 
use of ~X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which 
now require more detailed understanding, and thus in this instance, 
science has momentarily aggravated our fears. In fact, insofar as 
science generates any fear, it stems not so much from scientific prowess 
and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise, 
which, until they are understood, create uncertainty.   Perhaps 
the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding 
is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease. 
The situation with regard to our attitude and "control" of disease 
contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect 
to people. The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear 
I have tried to describe.

Nothing like Godot, he arrived before the hour. His letter had 
suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday, and I came into 
the lobby as the clock struck twelve. He was waiting.   My wish 
to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest 
in his work. American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays 
nihilistic. They find deep pessimism in them. Even so astute a commentator 
as Harold Clurman of <The Nation> has said that "Waiting 
for Godot" is "the concentrate **h of the contemporary European 
**h mood of despair". But to me Beckett's writing had seemed 
permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that 
I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism. Could it 
be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me? Is his a literature of 
defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face? Or is it relevant 
because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?
I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such 
questions, because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last 
analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself. Nevertheless 
I was curious.   My curiosity was sharpened a day or two 
before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher 
of literature, a Jesuit father, at a conference on religious 
drama near Paris. When Beckett's name came into the discussion, 
the priest 
grew loud and told me that Beckett "hates life". That, 
I thought, is at least one thing I can find out when we meet. ## 
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish. The features of his face 
are distinct, but not fine. They look as if they had been sculptured 
with an unsharpened chisel. Unruly hair goes straight up from his 
forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show 
that it really is hair and not bristle. One might say it combines 
the man; own pride and humility. For he has the pride that comes of 
self-acceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to 
impose himself upon another. His light blue eyes, set deep within the 
face, are actively and continually looking. He seems, by some unconscious 
division of labor, to have given them that one function and no 
other, leaving communication to the rest of the face. The mouth frequently 
breaks into a disarming smile. The voice is light in timbre, with 
a rough edge that corresponds to his visage. The Irish accent is, 
as one would expect, combined with slight inflections from the French. 
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green. He wore a brown knit 
sports shirt with no tie.   We walked down the Rue de L'Arcade, 
thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe 
opposite that church. The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing 
but it could hardly be called world-shattering. For one thing, 
the world that Beckett sees is already shattered. His talk turns to 
what he calls "the mess", or sometimes "this buzzing confusion". 
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our 
conversation. What appears here is shorter than what he actually said 
but very close to his own words.   "The confusion is not my 
invention. We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without 
being acutely aware of the confusion. It is all around us and our 
only chance now is to let it in. The only chance of renovation is to 
open our eyes and see the mess. It is not a mess you can make sense of".
I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth, 
but Beckett did not take to the word truth.   "What is more 
true than anything else? To swim is true, and to sink is true. 
One is not more true than the other. One cannot speak anymore of being, 
one must speak only of the mess. When Heidegger and Sartre speak 
of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't 
know, but their language is too philosophical for me. I am not a 
philosopher. One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that 
now is simply the mess".   Then he began to speak about the tension 
in art between the mess and form. Until recently, art has withstood 
the pressure of chaotic things. It has held them at bay. It realized 
that to admit them was to jeopardize form. "How could the mess 
be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and 
therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be"? 
But now we can keep it out no longer, because we have come into a 
time when "it invades our experience at every moment. It is there 
and it must be allowed in".   I granted this might be so, but 
found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously. 
And why not? How, I asked, could chaos be admitted to 
chaos? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art? 
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form. Beckett's 
own work is an example. Plays more highly formalized than "Waiting 
for Godot", "Endgame", and "Krapp's Last Tape" would 
be hard to find.   "What I am saying does not mean that there 
will henceforth be no form in art. It only means that there will 
be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits 
the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something 
else. The form and the chaos remain separate. The latter is not reduced 
to the former. That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation, 
because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates. 
To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of 
the artist now".   Yet, I responded, could not similar things 
be said about the art of the past? Is it not characteristic of the 
greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify, 
demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable 
way? What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting 
to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow 
themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic 
theory? Isn't all art ambiguous?   "Not this", he said, 
and gestured toward the Madeleine. The classical lines of the church 
which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory, dominated all 
the scene where we sat. The Boulevard de la Madeleine, the Boulevard 
Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery, 
bearing tidings of the Age of Reason. "Not this. This is clear. 
This does not allow the mystery to invade us. With classical art, 
all is settled. But it is different at Chartres. There is the unexplainable, 
and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to 
answer".   I asked about the battle between life and death in 
his plays. Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide; Hamm's 
world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living 
child outside. Is this life-death question a part of the chaos?
"Yes. If life and death did not both present themselves to 
us, there would be no inscrutability. If there were only darkness, all 
would be clear. It is because there is not only darkness but also 
light that our situation becomes inexplicable. Take Augustine's doctrine 
of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic 
qualities in this theology? Two thieves are crucified with Christ, 
one saved and the other damned. How can we make sense of this 
division? In classical drama, such problems do not arise. The destiny 
of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed 
into the dark. As she goes, she herself will be illuminated. At 
the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end 
she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that 
she moves toward the dark. That is the play. Within this notion clarity 
is possible, but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there 
is not such clarity. The question would also be removed if we believed 
in the contrary- total salvation. But where we have both dark 
and light we have also the inexplicable. The key word in my plays is 
'perhaps'". ##
Given a theological lead, I asked what he 
thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.
"Well, really there is none at all. I have no religious feeling. 
Once I had a religious emotion. It was at my first Communion. 
No more. My mother was deeply religious. So was my brother. He knelt 
down at his bed as long as he could kneel. My father had none. The 
family was Protestant, but for me it was only irksome and I let it 
go. My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they 
died. At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school 
tie. Irish Catholicism is not attractive, but it is deeper. When 
you pass a church on an Irish bus, all the hands flurry in the sign of 
the cross. One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps 
also the pigs".   But do the plays deal with the same facets 
of experience religion must also deal with?   "Yes, for they 
deal with distress. Some people object to this in my writing. At a 
party an English intellectual- so-called- asked me why I write 
always about distress. As if it were perverse to do so! He wanted 
to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home 
to give me an unhappy childhood. I told him no, that I had had a very 
happy childhood. Then he thought me more perverse than ever. I left 
the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi. On the glass partition 
between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help 
for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for 
the war refugees. One does not have to look for distress. It is screaming 
at you even in the taxis of London".   Lunch was over, 
and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming 
at us. ##
The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar 
to qualities I had found in the plays. He says nothing that compresses 
experience within a closed pattern. "Perhaps" stands in 
place of commitment. At the same time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly 
friendly. If there were only the mess, all would be clear; but 
there is also compassion.   As a Christian, I know I do not 
stand where Beckett stands, but I do see much of what he sees. As a 
writer on the theater, I have paid close attention to the plays. Harold 
Clurman is right to say that "Waiting for Godot" is a reflection 
(he calls it a distorted reflection) "of the impasse and disarray 
of Europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life". 
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to. "Waiting for Godot" 
sells even better in America than in France. The consciousness 
it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America, but it 
is the consciousness that most "mature" societies arrive at when 
their successes in technological and economic systematization propel 
them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture. 
America is now joining Europe in this "mature" phase of development. 
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens 
as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going 
on in the countries of Asia and Africa, and also of course on how long 
the cold war remains cold. 
Even Hemingway, for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality 
in <The Sun Also Rises> and <A Farewell to Arms> never 
maintained that sex was all. Hemingway's fiction is supported by a 
"moral" backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at 
a religious dimension. And D& H& Lawrence, in <Fantasia of the 
Unconscious,> protested vehemently against the overestimation of 
the sexual motive. Though sex in some form or other enters into all human 
activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect 
of human nature, it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of 
sex. "All is <not> sex", declared Lawrence. Man is not confined 
to one outlet for his vital energy. The creative urge, for example, 
transcends the body and the self.   But for the beat generation 
all <is> sex. Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary 
aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex. For 
the beatnik, like the hipster, is in opposition to a society that is based 
on the repression of the sex instinct. He has elevated sex- not 
Eros or libido but pure, spontaneous, uninhibited sex- to the rank 
of the godhead; it is Astarte, Ishtar, Venus, Yahwe, Dionysus, 
Christ, the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the 
body of the universe. Jazz is sex, marijuana is a stimulus to sex, the 
beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse. 
Lawrence Lipton, in <The Holy Barbarians,> stresses that for 
the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it is a 
mystique, and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities 
of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe 
of discourse. The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against 
the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in 
a public place. The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression 
of ungratified sexual desire. For this reason, too, their language 
is more forthright and earthy. The beatniks crave a sexual experience 
in which their whole being participates.   It is therefore not 
surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity, 
for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy. 
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy 
the precepts of legalized propriety. Unlike the heroes and flappers 
of the lost generation, they disdain the art of "necking" and "petting". 
That is reserved for the squares. If they avoid the use 
of the pungent, outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo; 
it is sacred. As Lipton, the prophet of the beat generation, declares: 
"In the sexual act, the beat are filled with mana, the divine 
power. This is far from the vulgar, leering sexuality of the middle-class 
square in heat". This is the Holy Grail these knights of 
the orgasm pursue, this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they 
respond.   If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out 
of the Egypt of sexual slavery, Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers 
them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence 
in liquor, marijuana, sex, and jazz. In addition, they have been converted 
to Zen Buddhism, with its glorification of all that is "natural" 
and mysteriously alive, the sense that everything in the world 
is flowing. Thus, paradoxically, the beat writers resort to "religious" 
metaphors: they are in search of mana, the spiritual, the numinous, 
but not anything connected with formal religion. What they are 
after is the beatific vision. And Zen Buddhism, though it is extremely 
difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled, 
helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through 
sexual release.   The style of life chosen by the beat generation, 
the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own, 
is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience. Jazz is 
good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided 
sexual effect. Jazz is the musical language of sex, the vocabulary of 
the orgasm; indeed, it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz, 
by freeing the listener of his inhibitions, can have therapeutic 
value. That is why, the argument runs, the squares are so fearful of 
jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it. Instead of giving themselves 
spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them, they 
undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes 
for satisfaction. Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy, the 
sacred road to integration of being. Jazz, like sex, is a mystique. It 
is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative 
impulse in unfettered man.   The mystique of sex, combined with 
marijuana and jazz, is intended to provide a design for living. Those 
who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free, their 
instincts put at the service of the imagination. Righteous in their 
denunciation of all that makes for death, the beat prophets bid all 
men become cool cats; let them learn to "swing" freely, to let 
go, to become authentically themselves, and then perhaps civilization 
will be saved. The beatnik, seceding from a society that is fatally 
afflicted with a deathward drive, is concerned with his personal salvation 
in the living present. If he is the child of nothingness, if he 
is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars, then he will consult 
only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil. He will not 
curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that 
makes him feel truly and fully alive, even if it is only for this brief 
moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the 
title of the holy barbarians; they will destroy the shrines, temples, 
museums, and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the 
life they believe in. Apart from the categorical imperative they derive 
from the metaphysics of the orgasm, the only affirmation they are 
capable of making is that art is their only refuge. Their writing, 
born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality, reflects 
the extremity of their existential alienation. The mind has betrayed 
them, reason is the foe of life; they will trust only their physical 
sensations, the wisdom of the body, the holy promptings of the unconscious. 
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate, but their 
faith in love, inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz, culminates 
in the climax of the orgasm. Their work mirrors the mentality 
of the psychopath, rootless and irresponsible. Their rebellion against 
authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt 
characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.   And the life they 
lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive, even though 
they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit- 
writing, painting, music. They are non-conformists on principle. When 
they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth, 
the rage of repudiation, the ecstasy of negation. It is sex that obsesses 
them, sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed. What 
they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can 
inspire the Muse. Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful 
middle class continue to suffer, whereas the beatnik has the courage 
to break out of that prison of respectability. One girl describes 
her past, her succession of broken marriages, the abortions she has 
had 
and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she 
must justify her passion. If it is an honest feeling, then why should 
she not yield to it? "<Most> often", she says, "it's the 
<monogamous> relationship that is <dis>honest". There is nothing 
holy in wedlock. This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist 
who disapproves of her life. She finds married life stifling and every 
prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.   This confession 
serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution: 
the craving for sensation for its own sake, the need for change, 
for new experiences. Boredom is death. In the realm of physical sensations, 
sex reigns supreme. Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on 
marijuana, jazz, free swinging poetry, exhausting themselves in orgies 
of sex; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and 
lose contact with reality. One beat poet composes a poem, "Lines on 
a Tijuana John", which contains a few happy hints for survival. 
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must 
move toward simplicity. The professed mission of this disaffiliated 
generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry 
and fiction, but what they produce is unfortunately disordered, nourished 
solely on the hysteria of negation.   Who are the creative 
representatives of this movement? Nymphomaniacs, junkies, homosexuals, 
drug addicts, lesbians, alcoholics, the weak, the frustrated, 
the irresolute, the despairing, the derelicts and outcasts of society. 
They embrace independent poverty, usually with a "shack-up" partner 
who will help support them. They are full of contempt for the institution 
of matrimony. Their previous legalized marriages do not count, 
for they hold the laws of the state null and void. They feel they 
are leagued against a hostile, persecutory world, faced with the concerted 
malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings, the police. 
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending 
their way of life, their search for wholeness, though their actual existence 
fails to reach these "religious" heights. One beatnik got 
the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and 
all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up. What 
obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk? Sex 
as the creative principle of the universe, the secret of primitive religion, 
the life of myth. Everything in the final analysis reduced itself 
to sexual symbolism. In his chapter on "The Loveways of the 
Beat Generation", Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details. 
No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West 
Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the 
group.   The women who come to West Venice, having forsaken radicalism, 
are interested in living only for the moment, in being constantly 
on the move. Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat 
generation are homosexuals, heroin addicts, and smalltime hoodlums. 
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks. 
Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana, they do not have to be 
initiated. Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana. As Lipton 
puts it: "The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana 
with far greater force, as a unifying principle in human relationships, 
than at any other time except, perhaps, in the mutual metaphysical 
orgasms. The magic circle is, in fact, a symbol of and preparation for 
the metaphysical orgasm". Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik 
comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense 
of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being. 
Carried high on this "charge", he composes "magical" poetry 
that captures the organic rhythms of life in words. If he thus achieves 
a lyrical, dreamlike, drugged intensity, he pays the price for his 
indulgence by producing work- Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" is 
a striking example of this tendency- that is disoriented, Dionysian 
but without depth and without Apollonian control. For drugs are in 
themselves no royal road to creativity. How is the beat poet to achieve 
unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic 
derangement of senses.   If love reflects the nature of man, as 
Ortega y Gasset believes, if the person in love betrays decisively what 
he is by his behavior in love, then the writers of the beat generation 
are creating a new literary genre. 
_@_ There were fences in the old days when we were children. Across 
the front of a yard and down the side, they were iron, either spiked 
along the top or arched in half circles. Alley fences were made 
of solid boards higher than one's head, but not so high as the golden 
glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them. 
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses; front 
fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle. 
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of 
cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail: 
high-pitched roof, pinnacle, and narrow gable. On these posts 
the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang.
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences 
was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree. The primary 
quality of that view seems, now, to have been its quietness, but that 
cannot at the time have impressed us. What one actually remembers 
is its greenness. From high in the tree, the whole block lay within 
range of the eye, but the ground was almost nowhere visible. One looked 
down on a sea of leaves, a breaking wave of flower. Every path from 
back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor, and every yard had its 
fruit trees. In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers 
had planted syringa and sweet-shrub, snowball, rose-of-Sharon and 
balm-of-Gilead. From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse 
of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's gingham 
skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor, 
or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter 
of garments hung there, half-way down the block.   That was one 
epoch: the apple-tree epoch. Another had ended before it began. Time 
is a queer thing and memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays 
with memory and memory with time are queerest of all. From maturity 
one looks back at the succession of years, counts them and makes them 
many, yet cannot feel <length> in the number, however large. In a 
stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond 
is quiet, its surface dark and shadowed, and there does not seem to 
be much water in it. Time in the sum is nothing. And yet- a year to 
a child is an eternity, and in the memory that phase of one's being- 
a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning 
and without end. The part of the mind that preserves dates and 
events may remonstrate, "It could have been like that for only a 
little while"; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds 
fast to things that were and they are outside of time.   Once, 
then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was 
bound round by fences, when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough, 
to twist my knee over it and pull myself up. That world was in 
scale with my own smallness. I have no picture in my mind of the garden 
as a whole- that I could not see- but certain aspects of certain 
corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums 
beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their 
sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned 
over by a dusty-slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked 
in the ragged, brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner 
between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on 
our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother 
for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.   It was 
mother who planted the verbenas. I think that my grandmother was not 
an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and 
grandchildren. My great-grandmother, I have been told, made her garden 
her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders 
in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to 
be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with 
common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed, 
and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house. These my 
grandmother left in their places (they are still there, more persistent 
and longer-lived than the generations of man) and planted others like 
them, that flourished without careful tending. Three of these only 
were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses, whose petals 
might not be collected until they had fallen, to be made into perfume 
or rose-tea to drink; the peonies, whose tight sticky buds would 
be blighted by the laying on of a finger, although they were not apparently 
harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies. I 
have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer 
morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than 
my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap, unfolded, and shook out 
like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals. Other flowers 
we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath 
the lilacs; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so prodigally but 
for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms 
that, 
turned upside down, make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little, 
dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.   More 
potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a 
few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae 
which are of the very stuff of the mind, intrinsic, because they 
were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that 
held them. Flowers, stones, and small creatures, living and dead. Pale 
yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods 
of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow 
columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and 
eaten 
for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped 
and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers 
from the trumpet vine that made "gloves" on the ends of ten 
waggling fingers. Fuzzy caterpillars, snails with their sensitive horns, 
struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded 
to "spit tobacco, spit". Dead fledgling birds, their squashed-looking 
nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they 
had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags. And 
the 
cast shell of a locust, straw-colored and transparent, weighing nothing, 
fragile but entire, with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down 
its back. Every morning early, in the summer, we searched the trunks 
of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells, carefully 
detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung, and stabled 
them, a weird faery herd, in an angle between the high roots of the 
tulip tree, where no grass grew in the dense shade **h. We collected 
"lucky stones"- all the creamy translucent pebbles, worn smooth 
and round, that we could find in the driveway. When these had been 
pocketed, we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles 
for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their 
dull exteriors indicated. We showed them to each other and said "Would 
you have guessed **h"? Squatting on our haunches beside the 
flat stone we broke them on, we were safe behind the high closed gates 
at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation 
and possible amusement of the passers-by. Thus shielded, we played 
many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the 
fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post 
was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let 
down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire, even then we paid 
little heed to those who went by on the path outside.   We enjoyed 
a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school. In 
the heat of the summer, the garden solitudes were ours alone; our 
elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch. They 
never troubled themselves about us while we were playing, because 
the fence formed such a definite boundary and "Don't go outside 
the gate" was a command so impossible of misinterpretation. We were 
not, however, entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street. 
We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they sag on their 
hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but we could stand on them, when they 
were latched, rest our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing 
to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that lay before 
our eyes.   The street that is full now of traffic and parked 
cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade 
of the curbside trees, and silence was a weight, almost palpable, 
in the air. Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell 
away again, crushed beneath it. A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter, 
the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees, and loose 
straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves. A wheel squeaked 
on a hub, was still, and squeaked again. If a child watched its progress 
he whispered, "Hay, hay, load of hay- make a wish and turn 
away", and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the 
sound of the horses' feet returned no more. When the hay wagon had 
gone, and an interval passed, a huckster's cart might turn the corner. 
The horse walked, the reins were slack, the huckster rode with bowed 
shoulders, his forearms across his knees. Sleepily, as if half-reluctant 
to break the silence, he lifted his voice: "Rhu-beb-ni-ice 
fresh rhu-<beb> today"! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time 
like the drone of a bumble-bee. No one seemed to hear him, no one heeded. 
The horse plodded on, and he repeated his call. It became so monotonous 
as to seem a part of the quietness. After his passage, the street 
was empty again. The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down; 
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk, from sidewalk 
to lawn. At four-o'clock, or four-thirty, the coming of the newsboy 
marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front 
door, and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read 
what their neighbors had been doing.   The streets of any county 
town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were 
like this fifty-odd years ago, and yesterday. But the fences were still 
in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we stood on the gate to look 
over, the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving 
stones with grass between and on both sides. The curb was a line 
of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost 
in the ground or the roots of trees. Opposite every gate was a hitching 
post or a stone carriage-step, set with a rusty iron ring for tying 
a horse. The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center; 
it was mud in wet weather and dust, ankle-deep, in dry, and could 
be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones. It had 
a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since. The hoofmarks of 
cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as 
numerous as the traces of shod horses. Cows were kept in backyard barns, 
boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge 
of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys' 
coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.
It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story, 
because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and 
makes of them a curious, riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant 
for Mann's work.   The wife, Amra, and her lover are 
both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, "voluptuous" 
and "indolent", possibly "a mischief maker", with "a kind 
of luxurious cunning" to set against her apparent simplicity, her "birdlike 
brain". La^utner, for his part, "belonged to the present-day 
race of small artists, who do not demand the utmost of themselves", 
and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets 
as "wretched little poseurs", the devastating indictment "they 
do not know how to be wretched decently and in order", and the somewhat 
extreme prophecy, so far not fulfilled: "They will be destroyed".
The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want 
not simply of decency but of imagination as well. His appearance as 
Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle 
absolutely painful, an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed 
by spirit, untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation. 
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat 
man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches 
for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's, 
upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human 
life.   The music which La^utner has composed for this episode 
is for the most part "rather pretty and perfectly banal". But 
it is characteristic of him, we are told, "his little artifice", 
to be able to introduce "into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of 
hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art". And this occurs 
now, at the refrain of Jacoby's song- at the point, in fact, of 
the name "Lizzy"-; a modulation described as "almost a stroke 
of genius". "A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly 
torn away to reveal something nude". It is this modulation 
which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously, 
his wife's infidelity. By the same means he perceives this fact 
as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses, and dies.
In the work of every artist, I suppose, there may be found 
one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive, 
ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly 
so for being mysterious, as though some deeply hidden constatation of 
thoughts were enciphered in a single image, a single moment. So here. 
The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke 
gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore 
dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the 
bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, 
mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional 
touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack 
the problem of suffering"); the miraculous way in which music, revelation 
and death are associated in a single instant- all this seems 
a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, 
also, 
it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's 
work.   When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that 
this passage is of critical significance, I come up with the following 
ideas, which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in 
a later essay.   Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's 
heroes. The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically 
turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled 
and forbidden to love. The release, the freedom, involved in loving 
another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible; 
and the motion toward it brings disaster.   This prohibition 
on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly 
the artist (Tonio Kro^ger, Aschenbach, Leverku^hn) who suffers 
from it. The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem 
of the "breakthrough" in the realm of art.   Again, the sufferings 
and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment 
not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another 
with childhood, with the figure of a child.   Finally, the 
theatrical (and perversely erotic) notions of dressing up, cosmetics, 
disguise, and especially change of costume (or singularity of costume, 
as with Cipolla), are characteristically associated with the catastrophes 
of Mann's stories.   We shall return to these statements 
and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates. 
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of 
Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all these elements come together 
in prophetic parody. Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated 
with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially 
middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself 
dressed up, disguised- that is, paradoxically, revealed- as a 
child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child. That this abandonment 
takes place on a stage, during an 'artistic' performance, 
is enough to associate Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the 
punishment for art; that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable, as 
is anyone in Mann's stories who produces <illusion>, and this is 
true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature, technique, 
magic, guilt and suffering, are divided in this story between Jacoby 
and La^utner.   It appears that the dominant tendency of 
Mann's early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque the surface, 
is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic, the expressionistic. 
In a certain perfectly definite way, the method and the theme of his 
stories are one and the same.   Something of this can be learned 
from "The Way to the Churchyard" (1901), an anecdote about 
an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die 
of a stroke or seizure. There is no more "plot" than that; only 
slightly more, perhaps, than a newspaper account of such an incident 
would give. The artistic interest, then, lies in what the encounter 
may be made to represent, in the power of some central significance 
to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.   The first 
sentence, with its platitudinous irony, announces an emblematic intent: 
"The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad, ran 
beside it all the way to the end; that is to say, to the churchyard". 
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction. 
The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while 
the way to the churchyard belongs to death. But that is too simple, 
and won't hold up. As the first sentence suggests, both roads belong 
to death in the end. But the highroad, according to the description 
of its traffic, belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death, 
while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life: 
a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in the awareness 
of death. Thus, on the highroad, a troop of soldiers "marched in their 
own dust and sang", while on the footpath one man walks alone.
This man's isolation is not merely momentary, it is permanent. 
He is a widower, his three children are dead, he has no one left on 
earth; also he is a drunk, and has lost his job on that account. His 
name is Praisegod Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to 
his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister 
type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic 
strangers in "Death in Venice", for example, who represent 
some combination of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.   This strange 
person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path 
rather than the highroad. The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace 
young fellow, is not named but identified simply as "Life"- that 
and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him. "Life" 
points out that "everybody uses this path", and starts to ride 
on. Piepsam tries to stop him by force, receives a push in the chest 
from "Life", and is left standing in impotent and growing rage, 
while a crowd begins to gather. His rage assumes a religious form; 
that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness, 
Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God 
imprecates doom on Life- not only the cyclist now, but the audience, 
the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed". This passion 
brings on a fit which proves fatal. Then an ambulance comes along, 
and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away.   This is simple enough, 
but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant. The 
season, between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree 
aspect. Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because <he> cannot 
stop the cyclist, but also because God will not stop him; as Piepsam 
says to the crowd in his last moments: "His justice is not of 
this world".   Life is further characterized, in antithesis to 
Piepsam, as animal: the image of a dog, which appears at several 
places, is first given as the criterion of amiable, irrelevant interest 
aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon 
is "admirable", "a pleasure to contemplate"; another wagon 
has no dog, and therefore is "devoid of interest". Piepsam calls 
the cyclist "cur" and "puppy" among other things, and at the crisis 
of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into 
his face. The ambulance is drawn by two "charming" little horses.
Piepsam is not, certainly, religious in any conventional sense. 
His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically, connected with 
his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical. His unsuccessful 
strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings; 
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home, and "before this wardrobe Praisegod 
Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees, and in 
his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated".
The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is simply 
unreflective, unproblematic Life, "blithe and carefree". "He 
made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth".
Piepsam is grotesque, a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous 
and trivial. He is "a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard". 
But he is more interesting than the others, the ones who come from 
the highroad to watch him, more interesting than Life considered 
as a cyclist. And if I have gone into so much detail about so small 
a work, that is because it is also so typical a work, representing the 
germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing: 
the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical, destructive 
and self-destructive tendencies, much that is enlarged and illuminated 
in the figures of, for instance, Naphta and Leverku^hn.
In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details 
selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for "realism", 
anticipates a kind of musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional 
composition, in which, as Leverku^hn says, "there shall be 
nothing unthematic". It resembles, too, pictures such as Du^rer 
and Bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial 
proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a 
proverb, for example, or a deadly sin.   "Gladius Dei" (1902) 
resembles "The Way to the Churchyard" in its representation 
of a conflict between light and dark, between "Life" and a spirit 
of criticism, negation, melancholy, but it goes considerably further 
in characterizing the elements of this conflict.   The monk Savonarola, 
brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background 
of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious 
works displayed in the art-shop of M& Bluthenzweig; in 
particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, 
according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress. Hieronymus, 
like Piepsam, makes his protest quite in vain, and his rejection, though 
not fatal, is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out 
of the shop by the porter. On the street outside, Hieronymus envisions 
a holocaust of the vanities of this world, such a burning of artistic 
and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in 
Florence, and prophetically he issues his curse: "<Gladius Dei 
super terram cito et velociter>". 
The "reality" to which they respond is rationally empty and their 
art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and 
empty world. Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.
These polar concerns (imitation vs& formalism) reflect 
a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing 
over a long period of time. The breakdown of classical structures of 
meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations 
of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes. 
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal 
and spiritual qualities, and complete objectification in sub-human and 
quasi-mechanistic powers. The image of the world tends to reflect the 
hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces 
and overwhelming mystery. The image of God has simply disappeared. 
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory 
response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism: 
if man can neither know nor love reality as it is, he can at 
least invent an artistic "reality" which is its own world and which 
can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable 
of being known and worthy of being loved. The person of the artist 
becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by 
the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical 
systems.   Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and 
whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding 
the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually 
exclusive, that they belong together. Without the decay of a 
sense of objective reference (except as the imitation of mystery), the 
stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into 
being. And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves 
insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art, their peculiar 
authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously 
and gives promise that from their very substance, new and valid 
chapters in the philosophy of art may be written. For better or worse 
we cannot regard "imitation" in the arts in the simple mode of 
classical rationalism or detached realism. A broader concept of imitation 
is needed, one which acknowledges that true invention is important, 
that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic 
causal factors out of which it arises. On the other hand, we cannot regard 
artistic invention as pure, uncaused, and unrelated to the times 
in which it occurs. We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from 
the solipsism and futility of pure formalism. Accordingly, it is the 
aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation (which I shall 
call <mimesis> in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of 
imitation) and a new theory of invention (which I shall call <symbol> 
for reasons to be stated hereafter). 
#THE MIMETIC IMAGINATION IN 
THE ARTS#
The word "mimesis" ("imitation") is usually associated 
with Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, "imitation" is twice 
removed from reality, being a poor copy of physical appearance, which 
in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence. All artistic and mythological 
representations, therefore, are "imitations of imitations" and 
are completely superseded by the truth value of "dialectic", the 
proper use of the inquiring intellect. In Plato's judgment, the 
arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young, 
prior to the full development of their intellectual powers. Presupposed 
in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which 
a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating 
to the most sublime wisdom. Aristotle also tended to stratify all 
aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and, 
like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level. 
The <Poetics>, in affirming that all human arts are "modes 
of imitation", gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than 
did Plato. But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented 
it by describing in the <Poetics> what kinds of character and 
action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and 
important human truths. For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis, 
in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of 
expressing the character of fundamental reality.   The central 
concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called <Mimesis> 
is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation (based upon 
a recognition of levels of truth) to a Christian theory of imitation 
in which the levels are dissolved. Following the theme of Incarnation 
in the Gospels, the Christian artist and critic sees in the most 
commonplace and ordinary events "figures" of divine power and reality. 
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation 
in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent. 
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement 
of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama. The artist, unlike 
the philosopher, is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified 
high levels of abstraction. He is the conveyor of a sacred reality 
by which he has been grasped. I have chosen to use the word "mimesis" 
in its Christian rather than its classic implications and 
to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological 
expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the direct consequence 
of involvement in historical experience, which are not reserved, 
as in the Greek mind, only to moments of theoretical reflection.
In the first instance, "mimesis" is here used to mean the 
recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms 
of abstract ideas or conventional designations. By "image" is meant 
not only a visual presentation, but also remembered sensations of any 
of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined 
therewith. This is the primary function of the imagination operating 
in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images 
were first appropriated. Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to 
the actual re-living of experience, in which the imagining person recovers 
through images something of the force and depth characteristic 
of experience itself. The images themselves, like their counterparts 
in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately; 
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities 
and a unique relatedness to one another. They bring an inextricable 
component of value within themselves, with attractions and repulsions 
native to their own quality. As in experience one is seized by 
given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in 
value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation 
of images. Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism 
or realism in the conventional sense. A word taken in its dictionary 
meaning, a photographic image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing 
of a "scene" tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote 
such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without 
the incitement of value feelings. Similarly experience itself can 
be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues 
for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential 
field. A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection 
to a sense of immediacy.   The mimetic character of the 
imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation 
of artistic forms and materials. When words can be used in a more fresh 
and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and 
sounds, when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape 
all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of 
themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude of attention, all 
this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes 
upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance. These 
are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self 
and thrusts the self into decision and choice. The presence of genuine 
mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work 
demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely 
understood.   Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain 
presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which 
require some exposition before the main argument can proceed. Experience 
is not seen, as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting 
us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space 
and 
registering their character, movements, and changes on the <tabula 
rasa> of an uninvolved intellect. Neither is primary experience understood 
according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing 
is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing 
their responses in the appropriate sense organs. Primary feelings 
of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects 
(houses, trees, implements, etc&) nor a collection of isolated and 
neutral sensory qualities. In contrast to all this, primary data are 
data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.   The 
most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings, both positive 
and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment 
into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other 
part. These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers 
in which one is involved, some working for one's good, others threatening 
ill. Gone is the <tabula rasa> of the mind. In its place 
is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive 
or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined 
by constellations of process in which one is caught.   The principal 
defender of this view of primary experience as "causal efficacy" 
is Alfred North Whitehead. Our most elemental and unavoidable 
impressions, he says, are those of being involved in a large arena of 
powers which have a longer past than our own, which are interrelated 
in a vast movement through the present toward the future. We feel the 
quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening. 
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors 
of judgment in these apprehensions of value, but the apprehensions themselves 
are the primary stuff of experience. It takes a great deal 
of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger 
unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a 
collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern, 
devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far 
as they present themselves for inspection. Whitehead is here questioning 
David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he 
is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's 
presupposition 
that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from 
causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually 
imputed to the world, not directly perceived. What Hume calls "sensation" 
is what Whitehead calls "perception in the mode of presentational 
immediacy" which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception 
in the mode of causal efficacy. As long as perception is seen as 
composed only of isolated sense data, most of the quality and interconnectedness 
of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention 
of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical scepticism. Whitehead 
contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity 
of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other 
and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because 
the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and 
tendency to mistake the detail, is initially <given> in the way man 
feels the world. In this respect experience is broader and full of 
a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of 
his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct. 
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is 
one of derivation from the past. Both I and my feelings come up out 
of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are 
ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am. 
After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications 
of melioration, though "in a slight degree", to be sure.
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century. I leave 
it to the statisticians to say what they were, but I noticed several 
a few years ago, during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg. 
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school 
and the White school, and in every instance the former made a better 
appearance (it was newer, for one thing). It really looked as if a 
change of the sort predicted by Booker T& Washington had been going 
on. But with the renewal of interference in 1954 (as with its beginning 
in 1835), the improvement was impaired.   For over a hundred 
years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them. 
It's infuriating, this feeling that one is being picked on, continually, 
constantly. By what right of superior virtue, Southerners ask, 
do the people of the North do this? The traditional strategy of the 
South has been to expose the vices of the North, to demonstrate that 
the North possessed no superior virtue, to "show the world that" 
(as James's Christopher Newman said to <his> adversaries) "however 
bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it".
In the pre-Civil War years, the South argued that the slave was 
not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North. At 
the present time, the counter-attack takes the line that there's no 
more of the true <spirit> of "integration" in the North than 
in the South. The line is a pretty good one.   People talk about 
"the law of the land". The expression has become quite a cliche. 
But people can't be made to integrate, socialize (the two are inseparable 
by Southern standards) by law.   I was having lunch not 
long ago (apologies to N& V& Peale) with three distinguished 
historians (one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American 
history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them if they 
could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed 
with "deliberate speed, majestic instancy" (Francis Thompson's 
words for the Hound of <Heaven's> pursuit) by judicial fiat. 
They didn't seem to be able to think of any.   A Virginia 
judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years 
might be a reasonable length of time for such a change. But I suspect 
that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation- 
the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he 
said, "They make a desert, and call it peace" ("Solitudinem faciunt, 
pacem appellant".).
Moreover, the law of the land is not 
irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been, many times. Mr& 
Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the 
North, and soon became a dead letter. Prohibition was the law of the 
land, but it was unpopular (how many of us oldsters took up drinking 
in prohibition days, drinking was so gay, so fashionable, especially 
in the sophisticated Northeast!) and was repealed. The cliche loses 
its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.   The 
Declaration of Independence says that "governments derive their 
just powers from the consent of the governed". The phrase "consent 
of the governed" needs a hard look. How do we define it? Is the 
consent of the governed a numerical majority? Calhoun dealt with 
this question in his "Disquisition on Government".   To guard 
against the tyranny of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his 
theory of "concurrent majority", which, he said, "by giving to 
each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the 
action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial 
or local legislation". Who will say that our country is even now a 
homogeneous community? that regional peculiarities do not still exist? 
that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region? 
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal 
action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of "the consent 
of the governed"?   Circumstances alter cases. A friend 
of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular 
trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell. He 
seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular 
trouble anywhere. I murmured something about a possible difference between 
New Mexico's history and Mississippi's.   One can meet 
with aloofness almost anywhere: the Thank-Heaven-We're-not-Involved 
viewpoint, It Doesn't Affect Us! Southern Liberals 
(there are a good many)- especially if they're rich- often exhibit 
blithe insouciance. The trouble here is that it's almost too easy 
to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything. 
You've already sent your daughter to Miss ~X's select academy 
for girls and your son to Mr& ~Y's select academy for boys, and 
you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity. If there's 
no suitable academy in your own neighborhood, there's always New 
England. New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces, 
South as well as West. They may even enroll a colored student 
or two for show, though he usually turns out to be from Thailand, or 
any place other than the American South. It would be interesting to 
know how much "integration" there is in the famous, fashionable colleges 
and prep schools of New England. A recent newspaper report 
said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one 
thousand at Yale; that is, about one-half of one per cent, which 
looks pretty "tokenish" to me, especially in an institution which 
professes to be "national".   I must confess that I prefer 
the Liberal who is personally affected, who is willing to send his own 
children to a mixed school as proof of his faith. I leave out of account 
the question of the best interests of the children, the question 
of what their best interests really are. I'm talking about the grand 
manner of the Liberal- North <and> South- who is not affected 
personally. If these people were denied a voice (do they have a 
moral right to a voice?), what voices would be left? Who is involved 
<willy nilly?> Well, after everybody has followed the New England 
pattern of segregating one's children into private schools, 
only the poor folks are left. And it is precisely in this poorer economic 
class that one finds, and has always found, the most racial friction. 
##
A dear, respected friend of mine, who like myself grew up 
in the South and has spent many years in New England, said to me 
not long ago: "I can't forgive New England for rejecting 
all complicity". Being a teacher of American literature, I remembered 
Whittier's "Massachusetts to Virginia", where he said: 
"But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone, 
And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown". There 
is a legend (Hawthorne records it in his "English Notebooks". and 
one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page) to the effect that the 
<Mayflower> 
on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves. Whether 
historically a fact or not, the legend has a certain symbolic value.
<Complicity> is an embarrassing word. It is something 
which most of us try to get out from under. Like the cowboy in Stephen 
Crane's "Blue Hotel", we run around crying, "Well, I 
didn't do anything, did I"? Robert Penn Warren puts it this 
way in "Brother to Dragons": "The recognition of complicity 
is the beginning of innocence", where innocence, I think, means 
about the same thing as redemption. A man must be able to say, "Father, 
I have sinned", 
or there is no hope for him. Lincoln understood 
this better than most when he said in his "Second Inaugural" 
that God "gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the 
woe due to those by whom the offense came". He also spoke of "the 
wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited 
toil". Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that 
a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of 
the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade. After 
how many generations is such wealth (mounting all the while through 
the manipulations of high finance) purified of taint? It is a question 
which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds. But didn't 
they get off too easy? The slaves never shared in <their> profits, 
while they did share, in a very real sense, in the profits of the 
slave-owners: they were fed, clothed, doctored, and so forth; they 
were the beneficiaries of responsible, paternalistic care. 
Emerson- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire- sounded a high Transcendental 
note in his "Boston Hymn", delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music 
Hall amidst thundering applause: "Pay ransom to the owner and 
fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is owner, 
And ever was. Pay him"! It is the abstractionism, the unrealism, 
of the pure idealist. It ignores the sordid financial aspects (quite 
conveniently, too, for his audience, who could indulge in moral indignation 
without visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money 
from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic 
brokerage). Like Pilate, they had washed their hands. But can one, 
really? Can God be mocked, ever, in the long run?   New 
Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in 
Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, 
as Jefferson explained in his "Autobiography": "
The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa 
was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who 
had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on 
the contrary still wished to continue it. Our Northern brethren also 
I believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their 
people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable 
carriers of them to others".   But that was a long 
time ago. The New England conscience became desensitized. George 
W& Cable (naturalized New Englander), writing in 1889 from "Paradise 
Road, Northampton" (lovely symbolic name), agitated continuously 
the "<Southern> question". It was nice to be able to isolate 
it. ##
New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster 
to the Nation. There one finds concentrated in a comparatively 
small area the chief universities, colleges, and preparatory schools 
of the United States. Why should this be so? It is true that New 
England, more than any other section, was dedicated to education 
from the start. But I think that something more than this is involved.
How did it happen, for example, that the state university, 
that great symbol of American democracy, failed to flourish in New England 
as it did in other parts of the country? Isn't it a bit odd 
that the three states of Southern New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
and Rhode Island) have had state institutions of university 
status only in the very recent past, these institutions having previously 
been ~A+~M colleges? Was it supposed, perchance, that 
~A+~M (vocational training, that is) was quite sufficient for the 
immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in 
the post-Civil War period, the immigrants having been brought in from 
Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for the labor 
shortage caused by migration to the West? Is it not ironical that 
Roger Williams's state, Rhode Island, should have been the very 
last of the forty-eight to establish a state university? The state 
universities of Maine, New Hampshire, And Vermont are older and more 
"respectable"; they had less immigration to contend with.
A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in <The Yale Review>, 
said: "We in New England have long since segregated our children". 
He was referring not only to the general college situation 
but more especially to the preparatory schools. And what a galaxy of 
those adorns that fair land! I don't propose to go into their history, 
but I have one or two surmises. One is that they were established, 
or gained eminence, under pressure provided by these same immigrants, 
from whom the old families wished to segregate their children. 
In the early days of a homogeneous population, the public school was 
quite satisfactory.
AMONG THE RECIPIENTS of the Nobel Prize for Literature 
more than half are practically unknown to readers of English. Of these 
there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than 
Verner von Heidenstam, the Swedish poet and novelist who received 
the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago. 
Equally a master of prose and verse, he recreates the glory of Sweden 
in the past and continues it into the present. In the following sketch 
we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as 
possible speak for himself.   Heidenstam was born in 1859, of 
a prosperous family. On his father's side he was of German descent, 
on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility. The family 
estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Va^ttern in south central 
Sweden. It is a lonely, rather desolate region, but full of legendary 
and historic associations. As a boy in a local school he was shy 
and solitary, absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of 
Sweden's ancient glory. He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain 
and to dress for the part. Being somewhat delicate in health, at the 
age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once 
developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten 
years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, 
and Palestine. In one of his summers at home he married, to the 
great disapproval of his father, who objected because of his extreme youth.
Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio of Gerome 
in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the artists, but soon found 
that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction. 
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem, "The 
Happy Artists". "I scanned the world through printed symbol 
swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man. 
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart". 
In this final line, we have the key to his nature. Few writers 
have better understood their deepest selves. Heidenstam could never be 
satisfied by surface. It may, however, be noted that his gift for color 
and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.
The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was 
a volume of poems, <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years (Vallfart och vandringsar),> 
published in 1888. It was a brilliant debut, so much so 
indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's 
<Childe Harold>. Professor Fredrik Bo^o^k, Sweden's 
foremost critic of the period, acclaims it as follows: "In 
this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful, plastic, racy, 
vivid. In a bold, sometimes careless, form there is nothing academic; 
all is seen and felt and experienced, the observation is sharp 
and the imagination lively. The young poet-painter reproduces the French 
life of the streets; he tells stories of the Thousand and One 
Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus. In the 
care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the 
old happy existence, and for that reason he loves it. And yet amid all 
the gay hedonism in <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years> is a cycle of 
short poems, "Thoughts in Loneliness", filled with brooding, melancholy, 
and sombre longing".   Of the longer pieces of the volume 
none is so memorable as "Nameless and Immortal", which at 
once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language. 
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of 
Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian 
classic style now in existence. On the eve of his return to their 
native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises 
before them in its completed perfection. The supreme object of their 
lives is now fulfilled, says the wife, her husband has achieved immortality. 
Not so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple 
that is immortal. "The man's true reputation is his work".
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as "Thoughts 
in Loneliness" is, as Professor Bo^o^k indicated, in sharp contrast 
with the others. It consists of fragmentary personal revelations, 
such as "The Spark": "There is a spark dwells deep within 
my soul. To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's 
aim both first and last, the whole. It slips away, it burns and tortures 
me. That little spark is all the wealth I know, That little spark 
is my life's misery". A dominant motive is the poet's longing 
for his homeland and its boyhood associations: "Not men-folk, but 
the fields where I would stray, The stones where as a child I used 
to play". He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory 
life he has been leading. What he really wants is to find "a 
sacred cause" to which he can honestly devote himself. This restless 
individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all 
the rest of his life in Sweden. His cause was to commemorate the glory 
of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.
He did not, however, find himself at once. His next major 
work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic epic in prose, entitled 
<Hans Alienus,> which Professor Bo^o^k describes as a monument 
on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth. The hero, who is 
himself, is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East, 
a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from Professor Bo^o^k again, 
"even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from 
his painful search after the meaning of life. He is driven back by 
his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of 
Tiveden".   From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his 
deeper self. By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession 
of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions. He 
did not, however, settle back into acquiescence with things as they were. 
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little 
patience with collective mediocrity. He saw Sweden as a country of 
smug and narrow provincialism, indifferent to the heroic spirit of its 
former glory. Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear 
down the old structures and build anew from the ground up. Heidenstam's 
conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories 
of the past. ##
Whether in prose or poetry, all of Heidenstam's 
later work was concerned with Sweden. With the first of a group 
of historical novels, <The Charles Men (Karolinerna)>, published 
in 1897-8, he achieved the masterpiece of his career. In scope 
and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's <War and Peace>. 
About one-third as long, it is less intimate and detailed, but better 
coordinated, more concise and more dramatic. Though it centers around 
the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles /12,, the true hero 
is not finally the king himself. Hence the title of the book, referring 
to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield 
of Poltava, to quote from the novel, "the wreath he twined for 
himself slipped down upon his people".   <The Charles Men> 
consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories, 
each depicting a special phase of the general subject. Somewhat uneven 
in interest for an average reader, eight or ten of these are among 
the finest of their kind in literature. They comprise a great variety 
of scene and interest: grim episodes of war, idyllic interludes, superb 
canvases of world-shaking events, and delightfully humorous sketches 
of odd characters. The general effect is tragic. Almost nothing 
is said of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme being 
the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune 
and defeat.   To carry out this exalted conception the 
author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed 
in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale. His 
peculiar gift, as had been suggested before, is his intensity. George 
Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style. Of few authors 
is this more true than of Heidenstam. <The Charles Men> has a tremendous 
range of characters, of common folk even more than of major 
figures. The career of Charles /12, is obviously very similar to that 
of Napoleon. His ideal was Alexander of Macedon, as Napoleon's 
was Julius Caesar. His purpose, however, was not to establish an 
empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice. Each aspired 
to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god. 
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought 
ruin on the country that worshipped him. Each is still glorified 
as a national hero.   The first half of <The Charles Men,> 
ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709, is more dramatically 
coherent than the second. After the collapse of that desperate 
and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a 
time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous. 
Like Napoleon, he was the worst of losers. There are, however, some 
wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part, concerning 
the reactions of the Swedes in adversity. Then more than ever before 
did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness. This comes 
out in "When the Bells Ring", which describes the rallying of the 
peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.
In "The King's Ride", Charles breaks out of a long period 
of petulance and inertia, regains his old self, escapes from Turkey, 
and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years. 
He finds it in utter misery and desolation. All his people ask for 
is no more war. But he plunges into yet another, this time with Norway, 
and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall, being 
only thirty-six years of age when he died. He had become king at fifteen.
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular 
feeling. From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol 
of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden. This is 
brought out in the next to last chapter of the book, "A Hero's 
Funeral", written in the form of an impassioned prose poem. Slowly 
the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside 
the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral, the shrine 
of so many precious memories. The guns are fired, the hymns are 
sung, and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside 
the tombs of his ancestors. As he had longed to be, he became the 
echo of a saga.   Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction 
about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory. Excellent in their 
way, they lack the wide appeal of <The Charles Men>, and need 
not detain us here. It is different with his volume <The Swedes 
and Their Chieftains (Svenskarna och deras ho^vdingar),> a history 
intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high 
school students. Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to Swedish 
history for readers of other countries. Some of the earlier episodes 
have touches of the supernatural, as suited to the legendary background. 
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlo^f. Especially touching 
is the chapter, "The Little Sister", about a king's daughter 
who became a nun in the convent of St& Birgitta. The record 
teems with romance and adventure. Gustaf Vasa is a superb example, 
and Charles /10,, the conqueror of Denmark, hardly less so. Of 
Gustavus Adolphus and Charles /12, it is unnecessary to speak. 
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or 
handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always 
been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with 
those who have not. It is from this unpromising background that the 
fictional private detective was recruited. ##
THE mythological 
private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential 
ways. On the one hand, he does not work for a large agency, but 
is almost always self-employed. As a free-lance investigator, the fictional 
detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client. 
For this reason, he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure, 
whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 
9 to 5 routine. On the other hand, the fictional detective does not 
break strikes or handle divorce cases; no client would ever think of 
asking him to do such things. Whatever his original assignment, the 
fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime, usually 
a murder. Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in 
name, he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police 
themselves. He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to 
do so (frequently he does not receive a fee at all), but because he enjoys 
his work, because he firmly believes that murder must be punished. 
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman. 
He is, first and foremost, a defender of public morals, a servant of 
society.   It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and 
public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological 
detective. By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and 
his freedom from external restraint, the private eye is a perfect embodiment 
of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing 
what you please and let the devil take the hindmost. At the same time, 
because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal 
dictates of his society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is 
in middle class eyes a virtuous man. In this way, the private detective 
gets the best of two possible worlds. He is an individualist but 
not an anarchist; he is a public servant but not a cop. In short, the 
fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's 
ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere 
promote the public welfare. In the mystery story, as in <The 
Wealth of Nations,> individualism and the social good are two sides 
of the same benevolent coin. ##
THERE is only one 
catch to this idyllic arrangement: Adam Smith was wrong. Not only 
did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest 
number, he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to monopoly 
capitalism. The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe 
and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900. Now, although 
the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far 
as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades 
of the 19th century that the private detective became an established 
figure in popular fiction. Sherlock Holmes, the ancestor of all private 
eyes, was born during the 1890s. Thus the transformation of Adam 
Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides 
closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life. Driven 
from the marketplace by the course of history, our hero disguises 
himself as a private detective. The birth of the myth compensates 
for the death of the ideal.   Even on the fictional level, however, 
the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully 
resolved. The individualism and public service of the private detective 
both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct: 
he enforces the law without being told to do so. The private eye is therefore 
a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society. 
The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between 
good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal. 
Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold good. As 
capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon 
force and violence for its survival, the private detective is placed 
in a serious dilemma. If he is good, he may not be legal; if he is 
legal, he may not be good. It is the gradual unfolding and deepening 
of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution 
of the mystery story. ##
WITH the advent of Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the development of the modern private 
detective begins. Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist; 
he is very close to being a mental case. A brief list of the great 
detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr& Freud with 
ample food for thought. Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and 
other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances 
induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse, an incredible 
egotist, a confirmed misogynist. Holmes rebels against the social 
conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds. His 
eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom. It was in order 
to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became 
a detective in the first place. As he informs Watson, "My life is 
spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. 
These little problems help me to do so". Holmes is a public servant, 
to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.
The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard 
provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric 
behavior. Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland 
Yard, Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality 
of the police. They for their part are convinced that Holmes 
is too "unorthodox" and "theoretical" to make a good detective. 
Why do the police find Holmes "unorthodox"? On the face of 
it, it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official 
police routine. Another, more interesting explanation, is hinted at by 
Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have 
made a magnificent criminal. The great detective modestly agrees. Watson's 
insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes 
and his arch-opponent, Dr& Moriarty. The two men resemble each other 
closely in their cunning, their egotism, their relentlessness. The 
first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty 
grappling together on the edge of a cliff. They are presumed 
to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace. Linked to Holmes 
even in death, Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great 
detective, the image of what our hero might have become were he not a 
public servant. Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the 
detective, so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both. ## 
IN the modern English "whodunnit", this insinuation of 
latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared. 
Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey (the respective creations 
of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers) have retained 
Holmes' 
egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits. Poirot and 
his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that 
they are also extremely dull. Their dedication to the status quo has 
been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism 
of a Sherlock Holmes. The latter's real descendents were unable 
to take root in England; they fled from the Victorian parlor 
and made their way across the stormy Atlantic. In the American "hardboiled" 
detective story of the '20s and '30s, the spirit of the 
mad genius from Baker Street lives on.   Like Holmes, the 
American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time. But 
unlike Holmes, he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt. 
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere, the "hardboiled" 
private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed 
isolation. His alienation is far more acute than Holmes'; he 
is not an eccentric but rather an outcast. With Rex Stout's Nero 
Wolfe, alienation is represented on a purely physical plane. Wolfe 
refuses to ever leave his own house, and spends most of his time drinking 
beer and playing with orchids. More profound and more disturbing, 
however, is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe. 
In a society where everything is for sale, Marlowe is the only 
man who cannot be bought. His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary 
and difficult existence. Beaten, bruised and exhausted, he pursues 
the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low 
morals, always alone, always despised. In the end, he gets his man, but 
no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward. A similar 
tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers 
of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery 
stories, Dashiell Hammett's <The Maltese Falcon>. Sam Spade 
joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled 
statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last, it turns 
out to be a fake. Now the detective must save his own skin by informing 
on the girl he loves, who is also the real murderer. For Sam Spade, 
neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover, it is increasingly difficult 
to distinguish between the two.   Because the private eye 
intends to save society in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself 
in trouble with the police. The latter are either too stupid to 
catch the killer or too corrupt to care. In either case, they do not 
appreciate the private detective's zeal. Perry Mason and Hamilton 
Burger, Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting 
each other than they do in looking for the criminal. Frequently enough, 
the police are themselves in league with the killer; Dashiell 
Hammett's 
<Red Harvest> provides a classic example of this theme. 
But even when the police are honest, they do not trust the private 
eye. He is, like Phillip Marlowe, too alienated to be reliable. Finally, 
in <The Maltese Falcon> among others, the clash between detective 
and police is carried to its logical conclusion: Sam Spade 
becomes the chief murder suspect. In order to exonerate himself, he 
is compelled to find the real criminal, who happens to be his girl friend. 
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes 
now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of 
turning into his opposite. ##
IT IS the growing contradiction 
between individualism and public service in the mystery story which 
creates this fatal dilemma. By upholding his own personal code of behavior, 
the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society 
whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption. That society 
responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo, 
a potential criminal. If the detective insists upon retaining his 
personal standards, he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society. 
He must, in short, cease to be a detective and become a rebel. 
On the other hand, if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession, 
he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism. 
Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write 
mystery 
stories and turning to other pursuits. His successors have adopted 
the opposite alternative. In order to save the mystery story, they 
have converted the private detective into an organization man.
The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by 
Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. At first glance, this hero seems 
to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors. 
For Hammer, nothing is forbidden. He kills when he pleases, 
takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge, jury 
and executioner rolled into one. 
It will be shown that the <objectives> of the cooperative people in 
an organization determine the type of <network> required, because the 
type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages 
enumerated in Table 1. Great stress is placed on the role that 
the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness 
of the network. By monitoring, we mean some system of control 
over the types of information sent from the various centers. 
As a word of caution, we should be aware that in actual practice no 
message is purely one of the four types, question, command, statement, 
or exclamation. For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving 
a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk, "What 
time is it"? This sentence would have most of the characteristics 
of a question, but it has some of the characteristics of a statement 
because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in 
his own timepiece or the one attached to his car. If the man on the 
sidewalk is surprised at this question, it has served as an exclamation. 
Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer 
(and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer) the question 
has assumed some measurable properties of a command. However, for 
convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified 
according to Table 1. On this basis, certain extreme kinds of networks 
will be discussed for illustrative purposes. 
#NETWORKS ILLUSTRATING 
SOME SPECIAL TYPES OF ORGANIZATION#
_THE COCKTAIL PARTY._ 
Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire 
to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted 
and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy 
for future cooperative endeavors. The party is usually in a room 
small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another. 
The information is furnished by each of the guests, is sent by 
oral broadcasting over the air waves, and is received by the ears. Since 
the air is a continuum, the network of communication remains intact 
regardless of the positions or motions of the points (the people) 
in the net. As shown in Figure 1, there is a connection for communication 
between every pair of points. This, and other qualifications, make 
the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication 
system ever dreamed up. All four types of message listed in Table 
1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding 
the commands to a minimum, while <exclamations> having complimentary 
intonations are more than customarily encouraged. The completeness 
of the connections provide that, for ~<N> people, there are **f 
lines of communication between the pairs, which can become a large number 
(1,225) for a party of fifty guests. Looking at the diagram, we 
see that **f connection lines come in to each member. Thus the cocktail 
party would appear to be the ideal system, but there is one weakness. 
In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group, the 
**f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond 
comprehension if ~<N> exceeds about six. The crowd consequently 
breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six, with 
a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.
For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else 
and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers, then 
the "open house" system is advantageous because the honored guests 
are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections 
at the door. _THE RURAL COMMUNITY._ We consider a rural 
community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration 
is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary 
for family subsistence. We assume for this illustration that the 
size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings 
is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication 
is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2. Information 
beyond nearest neighbor is carried second-, third-, and fourth-hand 
as a distortable rumor. In Figure 2, the points in the network are 
designated by a letter accompanied by a number. The numbers indicate 
the number of nearest neighbors. It will be noted that point ~<f> 
has seven nearest neighbors, ~<h> and ~<e> have six, and ~<p> 
has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate numbers. 
In any social system in which communications have an importance 
comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point 
like ~<f> in Figure 2 would (other things being equal) be the dwelling 
place for the community leader, while ~<e> and ~<h> would 
house the next most important citizens. A point like ~<p> gets 
information directly from ~<n>, but all information beyond ~<n> 
is indirectly relayed through ~<n>. The dweller at ~<p> is 
last to hear about a new cure, the slowest to announce to his neighbors 
his urgent distresses, the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the 
one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or 
getting people to join him in a cooperative effort. Since the hazards 
of poor communication are so great, ~<p> can be justified as a habitable 
site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made 
available by a waterfall for milling purposes, a mine, or a sugar maple 
camp. Location theorists have given these matters much consideration. 
_MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS._ The networks for military communications 
are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be 
changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the 
addition of new machines of war. They also furnish proof that, in 
modern war, message sending must be monitored. Without monitoring, a 
military hookup becomes a noisy party. The need for monitoring became 
greater when radio was adopted for military signaling. Alexander the 
Great, who used runners as message carriers, did not have to worry about 
having every officer in his command hear what he said and having 
hundreds of them comment at once. As time has passed and science has 
progressed, the speed of military vehicles has increased, the range of 
missiles has been extended, the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles 
has been adopted, and the range and breadth of message sending 
has increased. Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision 
making, network structure seems to be paramount, and without monitoring 
no network has value.   On the parade ground the net may be similar 
to that shown in Figure 3. The monitoring is the highest and 
most restrictive of any organization in existence. No questions, statements, 
or explanations are permitted- only commands. Commands go only 
from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank. The same command 
is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to 
corporal. All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and 
terminate with action of the men in the ranks. Even the officer in charge, 
be it a captain (for small display) or a general, is restrained 
by monitoring. This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the 
hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility. 
The commands are specified by the military regulations; are 
few in number, briefly worded, all different in sound; and are combinable 
into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be 
desired on a parade ground. This monitoring is necessary because, on 
a parade ground, everyone can hear <too much>, and without monitoring 
a confused social event would develop.   With troops dispersed 
on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground, it may seem that 
a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines 
of communication. Years ago this was true, but with the replacement 
of wires or runners by radio and radar (and perhaps television), these 
restrictions have disappeared and now again <too much> is heard.
In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even 
in the field, are more formal. In the extreme and oversimplified example 
suggested in Figure 3, the organization is more easily understood 
and more predictable in behavior. A military organization has an objective 
chosen by the higher command. This objective is adhered to throughout 
the duration of the action. The connective system, or network, 
is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore 
not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated 
unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college,
