The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation    1.5127085093302464
of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence" that    1.5127085093302464
any irregularities took place.   The jury further said in term-end    1.5636360329510388
presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all    1.5127085093302464
charge of the election, "deserves the praise and thanks of the    1.6065767145351917
City of Atlanta" for the manner in which the election was conducted.   1.6432600607208703
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton    1.5127085093302464
Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible    1.5636360329510388
"irregularities" in the hard-fought primary which was won by    1.5127085093302464
Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr&.   "Only a relative handful    1.4513752902486308
of such reports was received", the jury said, "considering the    1.5636360329510388
widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size    1.6432600607208703
of this city".   The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's    1.67495327387791
registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate    1.4513752902486308
and often ambiguous".   It recommended that Fulton legislators    1.4513752902486308
act "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing    1.67495327387791
and improving them".   The grand jury commented on a number    1.5636360329510388
of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing    1.6065767145351917
departments which it said "are well operated and follow generally    1.5636360329510388
accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments".    1.6065767145351917
However, the jury said it believes "these    1.3761581156320553
two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce    1.6065767145351917
the cost of administration".   The City Purchasing Department,    1.4513752902486308
the jury said, "is lacking in experienced clerical personnel    1.5127085093302464
as a result of city personnel policies". It urged that the city "take    1.67495327387791
steps to remedy" this problem.   Implementation of Georgia's    1.4513752902486308
automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.   1.5636360329510388
It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling funds    1.5127085093302464
and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of    1.6065767145351917
the law may be effected".   The grand jury took a swipe at the    1.67495327387791
State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for    1.5127085093302464
child welfare services in foster homes.   "This is one of the    1.6065767145351917
major items in the Fulton County general assistance program", the    1.5636360329510388
jury said, but the State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute    1.6432600607208703
these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties    1.5636360329510388
in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives    1.6065767145351917
none of this money.   The jurors said they realize "a proportionate    1.6065767145351917
distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less    1.6065767145351917
populous counties".   Nevertheless, "we feel that in the    1.4513752902486308
future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available    1.5636360329510388
funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue to place    1.6432600607208703
a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.   The jury    1.4513752902486308
also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under    1.6065767145351917
fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and    1.6065767145351917
administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.    1.4513752902486308
The jury said it found the court "has incorporated into    1.5636360329510388
its operating procedures the recommendations" of two previous grand    1.5127085093302464
juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.   1.5636360329510388
"These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms", the jury said.   Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended "that when the new management takes charge Jan& 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences".   2.0009903998241785
The jury did not elaborate, but it added that "there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable".   1.9007743388451066
On other matters, the jury recommended that: _(1)_ Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and "a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail". _(2)_ Fulton legislators "work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable" pension plan for city employes.   2.0060531562189583
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.   1.9072964035494684
Mayor William B& Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife, Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton Superior Court Friday. His petition charged mental cruelty.   The couple was married Aug& 2, 1913. They have a son, William Berry Jr&, and a daughter, Mrs& J& M& Cheshire of Griffin.   Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon.   The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney" and his age as 71. It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika, Ala&.   The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year.   2.048631138073604
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E& Pelham Rd& ~NE.   1.5636360329510388
Henry L& Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney.   1.6432600607208703
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception of one brief interlude, since 1937. His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923.   The mayor's present term of office expires Jan& 1. He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr&, who became a candidate in the Sept& 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection.   2.0106523427038026
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.   1.8148785170373962
Robert Snodgrass, state ~GOP chairman, said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.   State Party Chairman James W& Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept& 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen& John Tower will be the featured speaker.   In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.   Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.   2.0475446242283293
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no- and there were no dissents.   1.8697775364991338
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a    1.6065767145351917
state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative    1.7026049541338664
courses must be taken: _1._ Five per cent of the voters    1.6065767145351917
in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be    1.6065767145351917
allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot,    1.6065767145351917
or _2._ The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit    1.6432600607208703
system- a system which the party opposes in its platform.   1.5636360329510388
Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations director,    1.4513752902486308
resigned Tuesday to work for Lt& Gov& Garland Byrd's    1.5127085093302464
campaign.   Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some    1.4513752902486308
time. He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville, who has    1.6432600607208703
been an assistant more than three years. When the gubernatorial campaign    1.6065767145351917
starts, Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for    1.5636360329510388
Byrd.   1.0
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday    1.5636360329510388
and head for home- where some of the highway bond money it approved    1.67495327387791
will follow shortly.   Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the    1.4513752902486308
Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators    1.6432600607208703
allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should    1.6065767145351917
be made.   Gov& Vandiver is expected to make the traditional    1.5636360329510388
visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment. Vandiver likely    1.6065767145351917
will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier    1.5636360329510388
in the session as his first priority item.    1.4513752902486308
Meanwhile,    1.0
it was learned the State Highway Department is very near    1.5636360329510388
being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction    1.6432600607208703
bonds.   The bond issue will go to the state courts for a    1.6432600607208703
friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales    1.7026049541338664
will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's    1.6432600607208703
most heavily traveled highways.   A Highway Department source    1.4513752902486308
said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million    1.7269387314284994
worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.    1.6065767145351917
The department apparently intends to make    1.2818970554302986
the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would    1.6432600607208703
be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax    1.7269387314284994
authorities.   Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with    1.5636360329510388
a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth    1.6432600607208703
of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov& Marvin    1.5636360329510388
Griffin.   The Highway Department source told The Constitution,    1.4513752902486308
however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans    1.6065767145351917
to issue the new rural roads bonds.   1.3761581156320553
Schley County Rep& B& D& Pelham will offer a resolution    1.5636360329510388
Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in    1.6432600607208703
voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.   Pelham    1.6065767145351917
said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the    1.6065767145351917
"quickie" vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether    1.6065767145351917
notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action    1.6432600607208703
would be sought.   While emphasizing that technical details were    1.5127085093302464
not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set    1.6432600607208703
aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31.   1.5636360329510388
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5.    1.6432600607208703
As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered    1.67495327387791
there to rescind the action.   Pelham pointed out that Georgia    1.5636360329510388
voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators    1.5636360329510388
to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.   1.5127085093302464
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House    1.5636360329510388
Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently    1.6065767145351917
opposed in the past.   Rep& Mac Barber of Commerce is    1.5636360329510388
asking the House in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal    1.6065767145351917
support for public education, provided that such funds be received    1.5636360329510388
and expended" as state funds.   Barber, who is in his 13th    1.6065767145351917
year as a legislator, said there "are some members of our congressional    1.6432600607208703
delegation in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution)    1.6065767145351917
passed". But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically    1.5636360329510388
asked him to offer the resolution.   The resolution, which    1.5127085093302464
Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, will be formally read    1.6065767145351917
Monday. It says that "in    1.1606783668269585
the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds", the    1.6065767145351917
State Board of Education should be directed to "give priority"    1.5636360329510388
to teacher pay raises. _COLQUITT_- After a long, hot controversy,    1.5636360329510388
Miller County has a new school superintendent, elected, as a    1.5636360329510388
policeman put it, in the "coolest election I ever saw in this county".   1.67495327387791
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran    1.5127085093302464
agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and    1.5636360329510388
chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.   1.4513752902486308
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush    1.5127085093302464
got 402. Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with a pistol, stood by at    1.6432600607208703
the polls to insure order.   "This was the coolest, calmest    1.5636360329510388
election I ever saw", Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said. "Being    1.5636360329510388
at the polls was just like being at church. I didn't smell    1.6432600607208703
a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble".   The    1.67495327387791
campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however. It was    1.6432600607208703
marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats    1.5636360329510388
of violence.   The former county school superintendent, George    1.4513752902486308
P& Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he    1.6432600607208703
resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.   During    1.6432600607208703
the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly    1.5127085093302464
received anonymous telephone calls. Ordinary Williams said he,    1.4513752902486308
too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.   1.6432600607208703
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities    1.5127085093302464
at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun    1.67495327387791
and promised an orderly election.   Sheriff Felix Tabb said the    1.5636360329510388
ordinary apparently made good his promise.   "Everything went    1.4513752902486308
real smooth", the sheriff said. "There wasn't a bit of trouble".    1.6065767145351917
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Committee approval of Gov& Price Daniel's    1.4513752902486308
"abandoned property" act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant    1.5127085093302464
protests of Texas bankers.   Daniel personally led the fight    1.5127085093302464
for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its    1.6065767145351917
rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before    1.5636360329510388
the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.   Under committee    1.5127085093302464
rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week. But    1.6065767145351917
questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses    1.5636360329510388
left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.   1.5636360329510388
Daniel termed "extremely conservative" his estimate that it would    1.5127085093302464
produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of    1.6065767145351917
63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug&    1.67495327387791
31.   He told the committee the measure would merely provide means    1.6065767145351917
of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books "since    1.6432600607208703
Texas was a republic". It permits the state to take over bank accounts,    1.67495327387791
stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven    1.5636360329510388
years or more.   The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally,    1.6065767145351917
would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other    1.5127085093302464
corporations to report such property to the state treasurer. The escheat    1.6065767145351917
law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate    1.6432600607208703
such property, Daniel declared.   Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler    1.4513752902486308
lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition    1.5127085093302464
keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual    1.6432600607208703
obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank    1.5127085093302464
customers.   "If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something    1.5636360329510388
to the economy", he said. "You take out of circulation many    1.6065767145351917
millions of dollars".   Rep& Charles E& Hughes of Sherman,    1.5127085093302464
sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount "to    1.67495327387791
making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance    1.6065767145351917
and pipeline companies".   His contention was denied by several    1.5127085093302464
bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B& Jones    1.5127085093302464
of Houston, J& B& Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.   1.6432600607208703
Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"    1.4513752902486308
since, he said, it would impair contracts.   He also complained    1.5636360329510388
that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was    1.67495327387791
introduced only last Monday.    1.0
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill    1.4513752902486308
of Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment    1.4513752902486308
of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.   1.7026049541338664
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more    1.5636360329510388
deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.   1.67495327387791
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the    1.67495327387791
House.   It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish    1.5636360329510388
county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or    1.6065767145351917
more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age    1.6432600607208703
to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential    1.6432600607208703
Texas School for the Deaf here.   Operating budget for the    1.5636360329510388
day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant    1.6065767145351917
and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460    1.67495327387791
yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed,    1.6065767145351917
Parkhouse told the Senate.   The ~TEA estimated there    1.4513752902486308
would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County,    1.6432600607208703
saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.    1.67495327387791

While details are still be to worked out, Ratcliff said    1.5636360329510388
he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed    1.67495327387791
constitutional amendment should be rejected.   "We're    1.2818970554302986
getting more 'pro' letters than 'con' on horse race betting",    1.5636360329510388
said Ratcliff. "But I believe if people were better informed on    1.6065767145351917
this question, most of them would oppose it also. I'm willing to stake    1.67495327387791
my political career on it".   Rep& Berry, an ex-gambler    1.5127085093302464
from San Antonio, got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies.    1.67495327387791
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected    1.6065767145351917
to give it a favorable report, although the resolution faces hard    1.6065767145351917
{THE HOUSE} passed finally, and    1.1606783668269585
sent    1.0
to the Senate, a bill extending the State Health Department's    1.5636360329510388
{THE    1.0
SENATE}    1.0
quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved    1.5636360329510388
by committees, passing the three on the calendar. One validated acts    1.6065767145351917
of school districts. Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont    1.5127085093302464
Navigation District.   The third amended the enabling act for    1.5127085093302464
creation of the Lamar county Hospital District, for which a special    1.6065767145351917
{WITHOUT    1.0

senators passed a bill by Sen& A& R& Schwartz    1.5127085093302464
of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for    1.6065767145351917
the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district. Money for its construction    1.6432600607208703
will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital    1.6432600607208703
{TWO    1.0
TAX REVISION}    1.0
bills were passed. One, by Sen& Louis Crump of    1.5127085093302464
San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of    1.67495327387791
miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return    1.5636360329510388
be notarized. Instead, retailers would sign a certificate of correctness,    1.5636360329510388
violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years    1.6432600607208703
in prison, plus a $1,000 fine. It was one of a series of recommendations    1.7026049541338664
{THE OTHER BILL},    1.0
by Sen& A& M& Aikin Jr& of Paris, would relieve real    1.6065767145351917
estate brokers, who pay their own annual licensing fee, from the $12 annual    1.67495327387791
{NATURAL GAS}    1.0
public utility companies would be given the right    1.4513752902486308
of eminent domain, under a bill by Sen& Frank Owen /3, of    1.6432600607208703
El Paso, to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas.    1.6065767145351917
{MARSHALL FORMBY} of Plainview, former chairman    1.2818970554302986
of    1.0
the Texas Highway Commission, suggested a plan to fill by appointment    1.6065767145351917
future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress, eliminating the    1.5127085093302464
need for costly special elections.   Under Formby's plan, an    1.5127085093302464
appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor, lieutenant    1.6432600607208703
governor, speaker of the House, attorney general and chief justice    1.5636360329510388
of the Texas Supreme Court.    1.1606783668269585
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- State representatives decided Thursday against    1.3761581156320553
taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay.   1.67495327387791
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee    1.67495327387791
a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when    1.67495327387791
Texas votes on a U&S& senator.   Rep& Wesley Roberts    1.5127085093302464
of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the    1.67495327387791
committee can kill the bill.   The West Texan reported that    1.5636360329510388
he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set    1.6432600607208703
it for public hearing on Feb& 22. The proposal would have to receive    1.67495327387791
final legislative approval, by two-thirds majorities, before March    1.4513752902486308
1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot, Roberts said.   Opponents    1.6432600607208703
generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information    1.5127085093302464
about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.   1.6065767145351917
All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep& Bill    1.5127085093302464
Jones, who was absent.    1.0
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas'    1.6065767145351917
big cities Thursday.   Rep& James Cotten of Weatherford    1.4513752902486308
insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House    1.6065767145351917
of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort    1.6432600607208703
Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet    1.6065767145351917
of 250 people.   When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114    1.6065767145351917
to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored    1.7026049541338664
by Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas.   Most of the fire    1.5636360329510388
was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen& Parkhouse. The    1.5636360329510388
bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan    1.5636360329510388
the state could make to a local water project.   Cotten construed    1.6065767145351917
this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large    1.67495327387791
cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing    1.6065767145351917
water for rural Texas.   Statements by other legislators that    1.5127085093302464
Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less    1.7026049541338664
populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway    1.6432600607208703
Cotten's attack.   The bill's defenders were mostly small-town    1.4513752902486308
legislators like J& W& Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika)    1.5127085093302464
de la Garza of Mission, Sam F& Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman    1.67495327387791
of Sulphur Springs.   "This is a poor boy's bill",    1.5127085093302464
said Chapman. "Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds. This would    1.6065767145351917
help the little peanut districts".    1.1606783668269585
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- A Houston teacher, now serving in the Legislature,    1.5636360329510388
proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning "educational    1.5636360329510388
methods".   Rep& Henry C& Grover, who teaches    1.3761581156320553
history in the Houston public schools, would reduce from 24 to 12 semester    1.67495327387791
hours the so-called "teaching methods" courses required to    1.4513752902486308
obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate. A normal    1.6065767145351917
year's work in college is 30 semester hours.   Grover also would    1.6065767145351917
require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours    1.6065767145351917
credit in the subject they are teaching. The remainder of the 4-year    1.6432600607208703
college requirement would be in general subjects.   "A person    1.5127085093302464
with a master's degree in physics, chemistry, math or English,    1.5636360329510388
yet who has not taken Education courses, is not permitted to teach in    1.67495327387791
the public schools", said Grover.   College teachers in Texas    1.5127085093302464
are not required to have the Education courses.   Fifty-three    1.5127085093302464
of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers    1.5127085093302464
of the proposal.    1.0
_PARIS, TEXAS (SP&)_- The board of regents of Paris Junior    1.5636360329510388
College has named Dr& Clarence Charles Clark of Hays, Kan&    1.5636360329510388
as the school's new president.   Dr& Clark will succeed Dr&    1.5636360329510388
J& R& McLemore, who will retire at the close of the present    1.6432600607208703
school term.   Dr& Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education    1.5636360329510388
degree from the University of Oklahoma. He also received a Master    1.6065767145351917
of Science degree from Texas ~A+~I College and a Bachelor    1.5636360329510388
of Science degree from Southwestern State College, Weatherford,    1.4513752902486308
Okla&.   In addition, Dr& Clark has studied at Rhode Island    1.5636360329510388
State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   1.3761581156320553
During his college career, Dr& Clark was captain of his basketball    1.6065767145351917
team and was a football letterman.   Dr& Clark has served    1.5636360329510388
as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools, as teacher and    1.6065767145351917
athletic director at Raymondville, Texas, High School, as an instructor    1.5636360329510388
at the University of Oklahoma, and as an associate professor    1.5636360329510388
of education at Fort Hays, Kan&, State College. He has served    1.6065767145351917
as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U&S&    1.67495327387791

_DENTON, TEXAS (SP&)_- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton    1.6065767145351917
Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62    1.5127085093302464
session upon the recommendation of Supt& Chester O& Strickland.   1.5127085093302464
State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in    1.4513752902486308
employment was called for yesterday in a report of a "blue ribbon"    1.6432600607208703
citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.    1.5127085093302464
The report, culminating a year long study of the ~ADC program in    1.6432600607208703
Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10    1.6432600607208703
long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ~ADC    1.5127085093302464
case load. The report called racial discrimination in employment "one    1.5636360329510388
of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and ~ADC    1.6065767145351917
The monthly cost    1.0
of ~ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million    1.67495327387791
dollars, said C& Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie    1.5127085093302464
Scott + Co&, committee chairman.   "We must solve the problems    1.5127085093302464
which have forced these people to depend upon ~ADC for subsistence",    1.6065767145351917
Martin said.   The volume of ~ADC cases will decrease,    1.5127085093302464
Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively    1.5636360329510388
with two problems: Relatively limited skills and discrimination    1.4513752902486308
in employment because of color. These, he said, are "two of the principal    1.67495327387791
underlying causes for family breakups leading to ~ADC".    1.4513752902486308
Other recommendations made by the committee    1.2818970554302986
are:   Extension of the ~ADC program to all children in    1.5636360329510388
need living with any relatives, including both parents, as a means of    1.6432600607208703
preserving family unity.   Research projects as soon as possible    1.5127085093302464
on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.   1.5127085093302464
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made    1.5127085093302464
statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge    1.6065767145351917
James B& Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.    1.5127085093302464
The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled    1.5127085093302464
observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six    1.67495327387791
attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.   1.5127085093302464
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant    1.6065767145351917
his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial. Bellows made the request    1.6432600607208703
while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom.    1.5127085093302464
"The statements may be highly prejudicial to my    1.4513752902486308
client", Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly    1.5636360329510388
indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property. It is impossible    1.6065767145351917
to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements    1.6432600607208703
involving themselves and others".   Judge Parsons leaned over    1.4513752902486308
the bench and inquired, "You mean some of the defendants made statements    1.6432600607208703
admitting this"?   "Yes, your honor", replied    1.2818970554302986
Bellows. "What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all    1.7026049541338664
fight in this case. There is a conflict among the defendants".    1.6065767145351917
_WASHINGTON, JULY 24_- President Kennedy today pushed aside other    1.5127085093302464
White House business to devote all his time and attention to working    1.6432600607208703
on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the    1.6432600607208703
American people over nationwide television and radio.   The    1.4513752902486308
President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod    1.67495327387791
writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of    1.67495327387791
White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.   1.6065767145351917
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning    1.5636360329510388
from Hyannis Port, Mass&, a White House spokesman said    1.5127085093302464
the address text still had "quite a way to go" toward completion.    1.6432600607208703
Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White    1.2818970554302986
House press secretary, replied, "I would say it's got to go    1.6065767145351917
thru several more drafts".   Salinger said the work President    1.5127085093302464
Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address    1.6432600607208703
involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions    1.5127085093302464
on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated    1.5636360329510388
by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.   1.4513752902486308
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov& 8 election    1.6432600607208703
were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M& Karns, who    1.5636360329510388
charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally    1.5636360329510388
illegal means".   Karns said that the cases involved a    1.5127085093302464
matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"    1.5636360329510388
of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in violation of    1.6432600607208703
the legal rights of citizens".   Karns' ruling pertained to    1.5127085093302464
eight of the 10 cases. In the two other cases he ruled that the state    1.7269387314284994
had been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings originally    1.5636360329510388
had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J&    1.6432600607208703
Wexler, special prosecutor.    1.0
Wexler    1.0
admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas    1.6065767145351917
to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned    1.5636360329510388
the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them    1.6432600607208703
before the grand jury.   Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election    1.5127085093302464
judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure    1.6432600607208703
constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion    1.4513752902486308
was used in questioning.   Karns said it was a "wrongful act"    1.6065767145351917
for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand    1.6065767145351917
jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious misuse"    1.5636360329510388
of the Criminal court processes.   "Actually, the abuse of the    1.5636360329510388
process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook    1.6432600607208703
county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the    1.6432600607208703
function of this court", said Karns, who is a City judge in East    1.67495327387791
St& Louis sitting in Cook County court.    1.3761581156320553
Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35    1.6432600607208703
persons. Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with    1.6065767145351917
"complementary" miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken    1.6065767145351917
from one candidate and given to another.   The cases involved    1.5636360329510388
judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st    1.7026049541338664
and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward,    1.7026049541338664
and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.   The case of the judges    1.67495327387791
in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken    1.7026049541338664
under advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under advisement.    1.6065767145351917
After reading his statement discharging    1.1606783668269585
the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases    1.6432600607208703
scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he    1.6065767145351917
would dismiss them.    1.0
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth    1.5127085093302464
new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million    1.6065767145351917
American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other    1.6432600607208703
medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by    1.6432600607208703
social security or railroad retirement programs.   The President,    1.4513752902486308
in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan    1.67495327387791
requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships,    1.6065767145351917
build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child    1.6432600607208703
health care and general medical research.   The aged care plan,    1.5636360329510388
similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a    1.6432600607208703
fight on Capitol hill. It was defeated in Congress last year.    1.6065767145351917
It would be financed by boosting the social security    1.5127085093302464
payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now    1.7269387314284994
paying such taxes.   The social security payroll tax is now 6    1.6065767145351917
per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4,800    1.7026049541338664
of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to    1.67495327387791
$5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each.    1.7269387314284994
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad    1.6432600607208703
retirement system.   The payroll tax would actually rise    1.4513752902486308
to 7.5 per cent starting Jan& 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because    1.7026049541338664
the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date    1.7269387314284994
to pay for other social security costs.    1.3761581156320553
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would    1.6065767145351917
amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would    1.6432600607208703
run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. Both figures would go    1.7026049541338664
higher in later years.   Other parts of the Kennedy health plan    1.6065767145351917
would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over    1.6432600607208703
the next 10 years. These would be paid for out of general, not payroll,    1.7026049541338664
taxes.    1.0
The aged care plan carries these    1.2818970554302986
benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad    1.67495327387791
retirement systems: _1._ Full payment of hospital bills for    1.5127085093302464
stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would    1.67495327387791
pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days. _2._ Full payment    1.7269387314284994
of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from    1.6432600607208703
a hospital. A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing    1.6432600607208703
home care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care for those    1.67495327387791
who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit. _3._ Hospital    1.6432600607208703
outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess    1.5127085093302464
of $20 a patient. _4._ Community visiting nurse services at home    1.6065767145351917
for up to 240 days an illness.   The President noted that Congress    1.6432600607208703
last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical    1.67495327387791
bills of the needy aged.    1.1606783668269585
He said his    1.0
plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish    1.7026049541338664
to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless    1.6065767145351917
staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-    1.6432600607208703
caused by an extended hospital stay".   "This is a very    1.5636360329510388
modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said,    1.5636360329510388
"and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any    1.4513752902486308
malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.   "This    1.4513752902486308
is not a program of socialized medicine. It is a program of prepayment    1.67495327387791
of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed. Every    1.5636360329510388
person will choose his own doctor and hospital".    1.4513752902486308
The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still    1.5636360329510388
be paid by the patient.   Apart from the aged care plan the President's    1.67495327387791
most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships,    1.5127085093302464
and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.   1.5636360329510388
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools    1.6065767145351917
cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need    1.6432600607208703
for health care. Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are    1.6065767145351917
not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the    1.6065767145351917
schooling costs.    1.0
The scholarship plan    1.0
would    1.0
provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal    1.5636360329510388
to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students. The    1.6432600607208703
schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need,    1.6432600607208703
of up to $2,000 a year per student.   In addition, the government    1.6432600607208703
would pay a $1,000 "cost of education" grant to the schools for    1.6432600607208703
each $1,500 in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined    1.5127085093302464
programs would cost    1.0
5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21    1.6432600607208703
millions by 1966.   The President recommended federal "matching    1.4513752902486308
grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing    1.5636360329510388
new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing    1.6065767145351917
ones.    1.0
In the area of "community health    1.2818970554302986
services", the President called for doubling the present 10 million    1.5636360329510388
dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction. He asked    1.6065767145351917
for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation for "stimulatory    1.5127085093302464
grants" to states to improve nursing homes.   He further    1.5127085093302464
proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.   1.5127085093302464
In the child health field, the President said he will recommend    1.6065767145351917
later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.    1.6065767145351917
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national    1.5636360329510388
child health institute.    1.0
The President said    1.0
he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.    1.6432600607208703
He did not say by how much.   For medical research    1.5636360329510388
he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions,    1.7026049541338664
in matching grants for building research facilities. The President    1.5127085093302464
said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540    1.6432600607208703
million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research    1.5636360329510388
in medicine.   The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable    1.5636360329510388
elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge,    1.4513752902486308
services, facilities, and the means to pay for them".    1.5127085093302464
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected    1.4513752902486308
lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under    1.5127085093302464
the social security system criticized the President's plan. Those    1.5127085093302464
who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.   Senate    1.6065767145351917
Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill&] and House Republican Leader    1.4513752902486308
Charles Halleck [Ind&] said the message did not persuade them    1.5636360329510388
to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance. Halleck    1.5127085093302464
said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair    1.67495327387791
trial first.   House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D&, Tex&]    1.4513752902486308
called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction    1.6432600607208703
on its fate in the House.    1.2818970554302986
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- Acting hastily under White House pressure,    1.5127085093302464
the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C& Weaver as the nation's    1.5636360329510388
federal housing chief.   Only 11 senators were on the floor    1.5636360329510388
and there was no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and    1.6432600607208703
"noes" was heard.   Customary Senate rules were ignored in    1.5127085093302464
order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing    1.67495327387791
and home finance agency.   In the last eight years, all    1.5636360329510388
Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been    1.5127085093302464
denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least    1.6065767145351917
a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.    1.6065767145351917
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen& Wayne Morse [D&,    1.6065767145351917
Ore&] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet    1.3761581156320553
selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.    1.4513752902486308
_OSLO_ The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting    1.6065767145351917
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been    1.5127085093302464
the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual    1.6065767145351917
understanding than in past meetings.   This has been a working    1.5636360329510388
session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed    1.6432600607208703
along its route step by step and without dramatic changes. In Oslo,    1.6432600607208703
the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine    1.67495327387791
attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.   1.5127085093302464
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable    1.4513752902486308
where relations are concerned between the "colonialist" powers    1.4513752902486308
and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.    1.7026049541338664
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated    1.6432600607208703
by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other    1.5636360329510388
allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances    1.5127085093302464
that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by    1.5636360329510388
its absence.    1.0
In the case of Portugal, which    1.2818970554302986
a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the ~NATO Council    1.7026049541338664
should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been    1.6065767145351917
a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general, remarkably courteous,    1.5127085093302464
explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been    1.5636360329510388
no explosion in the council. There should even be no more bitter surprises    1.67495327387791
in the ~UN General Assembly as to ~NATO members' votes,    1.5636360329510388
since a new ad hoc ~NATO committee has been set up so that    1.67495327387791
in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.   1.6432600607208703
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt    1.6432600607208703
to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the ~NATO    1.67495327387791
locomotive. Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against    1.5127085093302464
atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance,    1.6432600607208703
is today closer to the ~NATO line.   On the negative    1.5636360329510388
side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the    1.6432600607208703
United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.    1.67495327387791
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's    1.6065767145351917
speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened to add that,    1.5127085093302464
if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr& Rusk's    1.6065767145351917
analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the    1.6065767145351917
West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly    1.6432600607208703
fixed its policy.    1.0
A certain vagueness may also    1.1606783668269585
be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council    1.6432600607208703
meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents    1.6432600607208703
accredited.   The impression has nevertheless been    1.2818970554302986
given during these three days, despite Mr& Rusk's personal popularity,    1.5636360329510388
that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat    1.6065767145351917
tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn    1.6432600607208703
than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application    1.6432600607208703
to individual danger spots.   The Secretary of State    1.4513752902486308
himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of    1.67495327387791
events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the    1.6065767145351917
new administration in the past four months.   But where the core    1.6065767145351917
of ~NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only    1.6065767145351917
reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance,    1.5127085093302464
"cornerstone" of its foreign policy, but has announced that five    1.5636360329510388
nuclear submarines will eventually be at ~NATO's disposal in    1.5127085093302464
European waters.   The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated    1.5636360329510388
a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will    1.6065767145351917
not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken    1.6432600607208703
up by the council as a whole.    1.3761581156320553
The secretary's    1.0
greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of ~NATO realization    1.5127085093302464
that East-West friction, wherever it take place around the    1.5127085093302464
globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different    1.6065767145351917
societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical    1.6065767145351917
distance or lack of apparent connection.   The annual spring    1.5127085093302464
meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more, deeper,    1.6065767145351917
and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use    1.5636360329510388
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (when    1.5127085093302464
ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries,    1.6065767145351917
and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the    1.6065767145351917
maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.   This increase in the    1.5127085093302464
"threshold", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will    1.5127085093302464
prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months    1.6065767145351917
to come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid    1.67495327387791
down, but never completely fulfilled.    1.1606783668269585
_WASHINGTON_ The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a    1.4513752902486308
Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy    1.6432600607208703
erupts for the first time.   There is little optimism here    1.5636360329510388
that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table    1.6432600607208703
than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.   The    1.6432600607208703
United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly    1.5127085093302464
interested in setting up an international inspection system which will    1.5636360329510388
prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring    1.67495327387791
Thailand and South Viet Nam.   They count on the aid    1.5636360329510388
of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve    1.5636360329510388
this.   The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet    1.5636360329510388
would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent that no acceptable    1.6432600607208703
formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.    1.5127085093302464
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire    1.5636360329510388
in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the    1.6432600607208703
cease-fire by the international control commission before participating    1.4513752902486308
in the Geneva conference.   This is another of the modifications    1.5636360329510388
of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled    1.6065767145351917
to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to    1.6432600607208703
basic errors made in the previous administration.   Its spokesmen    1.5127085093302464
insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in    1.6432600607208703
military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.   But    1.5636360329510388
with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the    1.6065767145351917
Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:   1.6065767145351917
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy    1.4513752902486308
decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?   Former    1.4513752902486308
Vice-President Richard M& Nixon in Detroit called for a    1.5127085093302464
firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union. He was critical    1.6065767145351917
of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.    1.6432600607208703
It does not take a Gallup poll to    1.4513752902486308
find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the    1.6065767145351917
situation as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves    1.5636360329510388
from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been    1.6065767145351917
in power, would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders" in    1.5636360329510388
Cuba.   One Republican senator told this correspondent that he    1.5127085093302464
was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration    1.6065767145351917
on this score. His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the    1.67495327387791
need for unity in the country now. But he further said that it was    1.7026049541338664
better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies    1.6065767145351917
first.   The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through    1.5127085093302464
Senator Thruston B& Morton (~R) of Kentucky, chairman    1.4513752902486308
of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration    1.5127085093302464
would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition    1.6432600607208703
government susceptible of Communist domination.   Kennedy administration    1.3761581156320553
policies also have been assailed now from another direction    1.5127085093302464
by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute    1.5127085093302464
of Technology educators.    1.0
This group pleads    1.0
with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion    1.6065767145351917
of Cuba by exile groups". It recommends that the United States    1.6065767145351917
"seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc    1.6065767145351917
by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations;    1.6432600607208703
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other    1.5127085093302464
parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian    1.5636360329510388
nationalism feeds".   Mr& Nixon, for his part, would oppose    1.5127085093302464
intervention in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend    1.5636360329510388
that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries    1.5127085093302464
shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.   1.6432600607208703
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories    1.5127085093302464
in Laos,    1.0
almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended    1.6065767145351917
a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Nixon and the professors.    1.1606783668269585
Very early    1.0
in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels,    1.5636360329510388
a high official source disclosed, that the new administration    1.5127085093302464
would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during    1.5636360329510388
the formative period of the administration.   Strenuous efforts    1.4513752902486308
were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements. Policies    1.5636360329510388
on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But    1.5636360329510388
thus far there has been no response in kind.   Foreign aid programs    1.6432600607208703
were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to    1.6065767145351917
encourage political reform in recipient nations.   In Laos, the    1.5127085093302464
administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show    1.5127085093302464
determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters    1.5636360329510388
as a useless gesture.   Again and again it asked the Communists    1.6065767145351917
to "freeze" the military situation in Laos. But the Communists    1.5636360329510388
aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.   And after several    1.6432600607208703
correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the    1.5127085093302464
huge build-up,    1.0
administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a    1.3761581156320553
"great service" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty    1.6065767145351917
Organization.   ~SEATO was steamed up and prepared    1.3761581156320553
contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos. But    1.6065767145351917
the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for    1.6065767145351917
the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.    1.7269387314284994
(Some ~SEATO nations disagreed, however.)   There    1.2818970554302986
was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded    1.6065767145351917
that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined    1.67495327387791
neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.   The administration    1.4513752902486308
declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos. The pro-Western    1.5636360329510388
government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against    1.6065767145351917
the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did appear    1.4513752902486308
to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.   There    1.6065767145351917
certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United    1.67495327387791
States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.   1.5636360329510388
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an    1.6432600607208703
acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was    1.5636360329510388
too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.   1.5636360329510388
One factor was the statement of Senator J& W& Fulbright (~D)    1.6065767145351917
of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.    1.5127085093302464
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a    1.6432600607208703
year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal" of Prince Souvanna.    1.6432600607208703
_WASHINGTON_ The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check    1.5636360329510388
the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.   1.5636360329510388
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect    1.6065767145351917
upon the "vitality of the nation".   In an important assertion    1.5636360329510388
of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive    1.6065767145351917
order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency    1.4513752902486308
and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory    1.6065767145351917
Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.   The    1.4513752902486308
President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts    1.6065767145351917
through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to    1.5636360329510388
states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.    1.5636360329510388
The President has also called upon the Attorney    1.4513752902486308
General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and    1.5127085093302464
the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development    1.6065767145351917
of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local    1.6065767145351917
communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.   Simultaneously    1.5636360329510388
the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L&    1.5127085093302464
Hackett, a special assistant ot the Attorney General, as executive    1.5636360329510388
director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth    1.5636360329510388
Crime.   His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the    1.6065767145351917
fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since    1.6432600607208703
1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.   Among arrests    1.5636360329510388
reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about    1.5636360329510388
half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.   1.6432600607208703
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin    1.5636360329510388
by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H& Hawksley, the    1.5127085093302464
present city ~CD head, believes.   Mr& Hawksley said yesterday    1.5127085093302464
he would be willing to go before the city council "or anyone    1.6432600607208703
else locally" to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.   1.6065767145351917
East Providence now has no civil defense program. Mr& Hawksley,    1.5636360329510388
the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time ~CD    1.5127085093302464
director in the city for the last nine years. He is not interested in    1.7026049541338664
being named a full-time director.   Noting that President Kennedy    1.5127085093302464
has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for    1.5127085093302464
the nation's civil defense program, Mr& Hawksley said the federal    1.5636360329510388
government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.   1.6065767145351917
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a ~CD director    1.6065767145351917
for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount    1.7269387314284994
on    1.0
a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.   Mr& Hawksley    1.6065767145351917
said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents    1.6065767145351917
who would be willing to take the full-time ~CD job. One of these    1.67495327387791
men is former Fire Chief John A& Laughlin, he said.   Along    1.6065767145351917
with a director, the city should provide a ~CD headquarters so    1.6065767145351917
that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Hawksley said.   One advantage that would come to    1.5127085093302464
the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence    1.67495327387791
would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial    1.6065767145351917
aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense    1.5636360329510388
program.   Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of    1.5636360329510388
such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.   Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue    1.5636360329510388
trucks, similar to the ~CD vehicle obtained several years ago and    1.6065767145351917
now detailed to the Central Fire Station.   He would assign    1.5636360329510388
one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the    1.7026049541338664
other to the Rumford area.   Speaking of the present status of    1.6065767145351917
civil defense in the city, Mr& Hawksley said he would be willing    1.6432600607208703
to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to    1.7269387314284994
do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.   The Narragansett    1.7026049541338664
Race Track grounds is one assembly point, he said, and a drive-in    1.6432600607208703
theater in Seekonk would be another. Riverside residents would    1.5127085093302464
go to the Seekonk assembly point.   Mr& Hawksley said he was    1.6065767145351917
not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to    1.7026049541338664
assemble in case of an air attack.   Such vital information, he    1.6065767145351917
said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular    1.67495327387791
intervals for residents to know.   If the city council fails to    1.6065767145351917
consider appointment of a full-time ~CD director, Mr& Hawksley    1.5127085093302464
said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a    1.7026049541338664
civil defense organization will be developed locally.   One of    1.5127085093302464
the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in    1.7026049541338664
first aid. Other steps would be developed after information drifts down    1.6065767145351917
to the local level from the federal government.   1.4513752902486308
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible    1.6432600607208703
revisions in mind.   Governor Notte said last night he    1.5127085093302464
plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations    1.7026049541338664
for possible changes in time for the next session of the General    1.6432600607208703
Assembly.   The governor's move into the so-called "blue    1.4513752902486308
law" controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R&    1.67495327387791
Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy was released to    1.6432600607208703
the press.   Mr& Notte was responding to a resolution adopted    1.5636360329510388
by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state    1.7026049541338664
house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges the governor to have a    1.6432600607208703
complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision    1.7026049541338664
at the next session of the legislature.   While the city    1.5636360329510388
council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review,    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty&    1.67495327387791
Gen& J& Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views".    1.6065767145351917
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr& Nugent's    1.5636360329510388
cooperation, the governor said.   "I would expect the proposed    1.5127085093302464
committee to hold public hearings", Mr& Notte said, "to obtain    1.5636360329510388
the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest    1.6065767145351917
groups affected by these laws".   The governor wrote    1.4513752902486308
Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "with the continuous    1.67495327387791
problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers    1.5636360329510388
as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales".   The    1.5636360329510388
attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce    1.67495327387791
the blue laws. Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has    1.6432600607208703
said, the state police will step into the situation.   There    1.5636360329510388
has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in    1.6432600607208703
Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales    1.6065767145351917
laws. The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island    1.6432600607208703
and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit    1.6065767145351917
the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.   The    1.6432600607208703
Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more    1.5127085093302464
foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery    1.6065767145351917
and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.   The only    1.6432600607208703
day they "have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on    1.6432600607208703
Sunday", the council's resolution said. The small shops "must    1.5127085093302464
be retained, for they provide essential service to the community",    1.5636360329510388
according to the resolution, which added that they "also are the source    1.6432600607208703
of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares that    1.5636360329510388
Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue" to the local government.   1.5636360329510388
The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets,    1.4513752902486308
factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business"    1.6065767145351917
on Sunday. They "operate on a volume basis", it was contended,    1.6065767145351917
"and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital    1.6065767145351917
shopping needs of the community".   1.1606783668269585
Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic and    1.4513752902486308
Republican- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties,    1.5127085093302464
George H& Reama, nationally known labor-management expert, said    1.4513752902486308
here yesterday.   Mr& Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence    1.5636360329510388
at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about    1.5127085093302464
half of the people in the country want the "welfare" type of government    1.67495327387791
and the other half want a free enterprise system. He suggested    1.6065767145351917
that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull    1.67495327387791
at the right lever for him on election day.   He said he was "confessing    1.7026049541338664
that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910".    1.6065767145351917
That, he added, was when he was "a very young man, a machinist and    1.7026049541338664
toolmaker by trade.   "That was before I studied law. Some    1.5636360329510388
of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist    1.67495327387791
Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist    1.67495327387791
track. He steered me to the right track- the free enterprise track".   1.6432600607208703
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party    1.6432600607208703
called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of    1.6065767145351917
all resources. He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever    1.5636360329510388
gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to    1.6432600607208703
pass under both major parties.   Mr& Reama, who retired as vice    1.6065767145351917
president of the American Screw Co& in 1955 said, "Both parties    1.6065767145351917
in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth    1.7026049541338664
in the gross national product- but neither told us how to achieve it".   1.67495327387791
He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but manufacturers    1.5636360329510388
are caught in a profit squeeze"- and raises should only    1.5636360329510388
come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.   1.6065767145351917
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy,    1.7026049541338664
Mr& Reama said: "A Socialist is a person who believes    1.5636360329510388
in dividing everything he does not own". Mr& Reama, far from    1.6065767145351917
really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.   1.5127085093302464
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston    1.5636360329510388
taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped    1.67495327387791
will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.   1.7026049541338664
William A& Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group    1.4513752902486308
of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right    1.6432600607208703
hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council    1.67495327387791
President Raymond Fortin Sr&.   The law which governs    1.4513752902486308
home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the    1.6432600607208703
chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures    1.6065767145351917
within 10 days and Mr& Martinelli happens to hold that post.   1.6065767145351917
Mr& Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough    1.5636360329510388
signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter    1.67495327387791
and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70    1.6065767145351917
days. He explained that by law the council must establish procedures    1.6065767145351917
for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers    1.7026049541338664
completes its work.   A difference of opinion arose between Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Martinelli and John P& Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact    1.5636360329510388
manner in which the vote is handled. Mr& Martinelli has, in recent    1.6432600607208703
weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called    1.67495327387791
for the vote, while Mr& Bourcier said that a special election    1.6065767145351917
might be called instead.   Mr& Bourcier said that he had consulted    1.6065767145351917
several Superior Court justices in the last week and received    1.5636360329510388
opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr& Martinelli and    1.5127085093302464
the council that he would study the correct method and report back to    1.67495327387791
the council as soon as possible.   Mr& Martinelli said yesterday    1.5636360329510388
that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to    1.6432600607208703
plan further strategy in the charter movement. He said that the group    1.6432600607208703
has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but    1.6432600607208703
that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.   1.5636360329510388
"After inspiring this, I think we should certainly follow through    1.5636360329510388
on it", he declared. "It has become our responsibility and I    1.6065767145351917
hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement".    1.5127085093302464
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members    1.7269387314284994
of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan    1.6065767145351917
ballot for posts on the charter commission.   "Our most immediate    1.5636360329510388
goal is to increase public awareness of the movement", he indicated,    1.6065767145351917
"and to tell them what this will mean for the town". He expects    1.67495327387791
that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled    1.6432600607208703
during the last week in September.   Some opposition to the home    1.6065767145351917
rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the    1.6065767145351917
town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home    1.5127085093302464
rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.    1.5636360329510388
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.   1.6065767145351917
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter    1.5636360329510388
was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain    1.67495327387791
signatures under what were termed "false pretenses". Several signers    1.5127085093302464
affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax    1.6432600607208703
increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly    1.5636360329510388
and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town    1.7026049541338664
take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.   1.4513752902486308
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty    1.5636360329510388
to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may    1.67495327387791
be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.   1.5636360329510388
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday    1.2818970554302986
he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A&    1.6432600607208703
Abatuno to draft the ordinance.   At the last session of the    1.6065767145351917
General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance    1.6065767145351917
as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.    1.6065767145351917
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.   1.6432600607208703
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District    1.5636360329510388
Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated to prosecute them    1.5636360329510388
because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.    1.6432600607208703
_PLAINFIELD_- James P& Mitchell and Sen& Walter H& Jones    1.5127085093302464
~R-Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign    1.6432600607208703
issue a remark by Richard J& Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial    1.5127085093302464
candidate, that the ~GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass    1.5127085093302464
of Eisenhower Republicanism".   Mitchell was for using it, Jones    1.5127085093302464
against, and Sen& Wayne Dumont Jr& ~R-Warren did not    1.5127085093302464
mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke    1.5127085093302464
at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel.    1.5636360329510388
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield    1.6432600607208703
Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains    1.5127085093302464
Country Club. It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in    1.7026049541338664
Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.   1.6432600607208703
Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention of    1.5127085093302464
the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower    1.67495327387791
Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood    1.5127085093302464
congealed after Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican    1.5127085093302464
Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the    1.7026049541338664
people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We can love Eisenhower    1.6432600607208703
the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president **h but    1.6432600607208703
there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership".   1.6065767145351917
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue    1.5127085093302464
in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can a man with any degree    1.7026049541338664
of common decency charge this"? he asked. The former secretary    1.5636360329510388
of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican "and proud    1.67495327387791
to have absorbed his philosophy" while working in his adminstration.   1.5636360329510388
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's    1.5636360329510388
Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism    1.4513752902486308
was a dead issue.    1.0
Jones said he regretted Hughes    1.1606783668269585
had made a personal attack on a past president. "He is wrong to    1.67495327387791
inject Eisenhower into this campaign", he said, "because the primary    1.5636360329510388
is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing    1.7026049541338664
an old national campaign".   The audience last night did    1.5127085093302464
not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.   1.6432600607208703
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary. He    1.6065767145351917
then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign. State    1.6432600607208703
aid to schools, the continuance of railroad passenger service, the proper    1.6065767145351917
uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority, and    1.6432600607208703
making New Jersey attractive to new industry.    1.3761581156320553
Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said    1.6432600607208703
the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate    1.4513752902486308
"Must share the blame for this". Nothing that Plainfield    1.5127085093302464
last year had lost the Mack Truck Co& plant, he said industry will    1.67495327387791
not come into this state until there is tax reform.   "But    1.6065767145351917
I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time", Mitchell    1.748515906000203
said.   Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited to    1.5127085093302464
eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions, saved his barbs    1.6432600607208703
for Mitchell. He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government    1.6065767145351917
in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for    1.5127085093302464
aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises.   "He    1.5636360329510388
calls for help while saying he is against centralization, but you    1.6065767145351917
can't have it both ways", Jones said. The state is now faced with    1.67495327387791
the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities, real    1.6065767145351917
estate or motor vehicles, he said, "and I challenge Mitchell to    1.6065767145351917
tell the people where he stands on the tax issue".    1.5636360329510388
Earlier, Mitchell said in a statement:   "I think that all    1.5636360329510388
Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President    1.5127085093302464
Eisenhower by Richard J& Hughes. His reference to 'discredited    1.5127085093302464
carcass' or 'tattered remains' of the president's leadership    1.4513752902486308
is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest    1.7269387314284994
war in all history, to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by    1.67495327387791
the American people as president of the United States, and who has    1.6432600607208703
been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the    1.6432600607208703
free    1.0
nations.   "I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking    1.5636360329510388
a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and    1.6065767145351917
bad taste.   "Such a vicious statement can only have its origin    1.6065767145351917
in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known    1.7269387314284994
by condemning a man of world stature. It can only rebound to Mr&    1.67495327387791
Hughes' discredit".    1.0
Sen& Charles W&    1.0
Sandman, ~R-Cape May, said today Jones will run well ahead    1.5636360329510388
of his ~GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination. Sandman,    1.5127085093302464
state campaign chairman for Jones, was addressing a meeting in the    1.6065767145351917
Military Park Hotel, Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign    1.5636360329510388
managers for Jones.   Sandman told the gathering that reports    1.5127085093302464
from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones    1.67495327387791
will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority    1.6065767145351917
given a candidate in recent years.   Sandman said: "The    1.5127085093302464
announcement that Sen& Clifford Case ~R-N&J&, has decided    1.4513752902486308
to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr& Mitchell    1.5636360329510388
is a dead giveaway. It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate    1.7269387314284994
who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's    1.6065767145351917
problems.   "We have witnessed in this campaign the effort    1.5127085093302464
to project Mr& Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from    1.6432600607208703
Washington. That failed.   "We are now witnessing an effort    1.5127085093302464
to transfer to Mr& Mitchell some of the glow of Sen& Case's    1.6432600607208703
candidacy of last year. That, too, will fail".   Sandman announced    1.5636360329510388
the appointment of Mrs& Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330    1.5127085093302464
Woodland Ave&, Westfield, as state chairman of the Republican    1.5127085093302464
Women for Jones Committee.   Mrs& Greenfield is president    1.4513752902486308
of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county    1.6065767145351917
committeewoman.   1.0
County Supervisor Weldon R& Sheets, who is a candidate for    1.5636360329510388
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to    1.5636360329510388
paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them. The    1.67495327387791
proposal, Sheets said, represents part of his program for election    1.5636360329510388
reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a "lip    1.6432600607208703
service word".   Sheets said that his proposed law would offer    1.5636360329510388
state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines, enabling    1.5636360329510388
counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge.    1.67495327387791
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines    1.6432600607208703
in the state by January, 1964.   Although he pointed out    1.5636360329510388
that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful,    1.5636360329510388
he added that the vital interest in election results transcended    1.5636360329510388
county lines.   1.0
The candidacy of Mayor James J& Sheeran of West Orange,    1.5636360329510388
for the Republican nomination for sheriff    1.2818970554302986
of Essex County, was supported    1.1606783668269585
today by Edward W& Roos, West Orange public safety commissioner.   1.5636360329510388
Sheeran, a lawyer and former ~FBI man is running    1.5127085093302464
against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder William    1.3761581156320553
MacDonald, for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy,    1.6065767145351917
now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals.   "My    1.6065767145351917
experience as public safety commissioner", Roos said, "has shown    1.5127085093302464
me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement    1.7269387314284994
experience, and preferably one who is a lawyer. Jim Sheeran fits    1.6065767145351917
that description".    1.0
_TRENTON_- William J& Seidel, state fire warden in the Department    1.5636360329510388
of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired after    1.4513752902486308
36 years of service.   A citation from Conservation Commissioner    1.5127085093302464
Salvatore A& Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction    1.5127085093302464
in the number of forest fires in the state.   Seidel joined the    1.6432600607208703
department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921    1.6432600607208703
from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment    1.6432600607208703
with private lumber companies. In October 1944, he was appointed    1.5636360329510388
state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section.   Under    1.5636360329510388
his supervision, the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques    1.5127085093302464
as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows    1.6432600607208703
and tractor units for fire fighting.   He also expanded and modernized    1.6065767145351917
the radio system with a central control station. He introduced    1.5636360329510388
regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training    1.6065767145351917
for section wardens. He is credited with setting up an annual    1.6065767145351917
co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross    1.5636360329510388
and State Department of Education.    1.1606783668269585
_BOONTON_- Richard J& Hughes made his Morris County debut    1.5127085093302464
in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night    1.6065767145351917
with a pledge "to carry the issues to every corner of the state".   1.67495327387791
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members    1.4513752902486308
at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn: "When I come back here    1.6432600607208703
after the November election you'll think, 'You're my man-    1.5127085093302464
you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected'".   He    1.5636360329510388
said, "We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what    1.6432600607208703
is right and just, and not what is expedient at the time".    1.6432600607208703
In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said,    1.5127085093302464
"The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over    1.5127085093302464
their feet for popular slogans to win the primary. But we'll have    1.6432600607208703
a liberal, well planned, forward looking, honest platform. We'll not    1.5636360329510388
talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the    1.7269387314284994
other side in Hudson.   "We'll take the truth to the people,    1.6065767145351917
and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party    1.67495327387791
in November".   He said, "You can see signs of the Republicans'    1.6065767145351917
feeble attack on the Meyner administration. But I shall    1.5127085093302464
campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead".   1.67495327387791
He urged New Jersey to "become a full partner in the courageous    1.6432600607208703
actions of President Kennedy". He called for a greater    1.5127085093302464
attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern    1.67495327387791
states, and a strong fight against discrimination in business and    1.5636360329510388
industry.   "We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean",    1.5636360329510388
the former Superior Court judge said. "To prevent hoodlums    1.5127085093302464
from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration    1.6065767145351917
in the early 1940s".   Calling the Democrats the "party    1.5127085093302464
that lives, breathes and thinks for the good of the people", Hughes    1.6432600607208703
asked, "a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard    1.6065767145351917
toward victory in November".   Hughes supported Gov&    1.3761581156320553
Meyner's "Green Acres" plan for saving large tracts of open    1.5636360329510388
land from the onrush of urban development. He said legislation for    1.6065767145351917
a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be    1.67495327387791
introduced Monday.    1.0
The plan will provide $45    1.1606783668269585
million for purchase of open land by the state. The other $15 million    1.67495327387791
is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.    1.6065767145351917
Hughes said, "This is not a plan to conquer space- but to conserve    1.67495327387791
it", pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each    1.5636360329510388
year since 1950. He said "Morris County is rapidly changing and    1.6065767145351917
unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be no    1.67495327387791

left to preserve".   Hughes would not comment on tax reforms    1.5636360329510388
or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved. He    1.6065767145351917
said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he    1.67495327387791
was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans. "After the    1.6432600607208703
primary", he promised, "I'll be explicit on where I stand to    1.6065767145351917
bring you a strong, dynamic administration. I'm not afraid to tangle    1.6065767145351917
with the Republican nominee".    1.0
_TRENTON_- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee    1.4513752902486308
who are retiring- voluntarily- this year were honored yesterday by    1.5636360329510388
their colleagues.   The outgoing members, whose four-year terms    1.4513752902486308
will expire a week after the April 18 primary election, received carved    1.6432600607208703
wooden elephants, complete with ivory tusks, to remember the state    1.5636360329510388
committee by.   There may be other 1961 state committee retirements    1.5636360329510388
come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican    1.67495327387791
voters.   A special presentation was made to Mrs& Geraldine    1.5127085093302464
Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35 years on    1.6432600607208703
the committee. She also was the original ~GOP national committeewoman    1.5636360329510388
from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's    1.6432600607208703
suffrage amendment. She served one four-year term on the national    1.5636360329510388
committee.   1.0
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders    1.4513752902486308
and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided    1.6065767145351917
to seek a third term with Paul R& Screvane and Abraham D& Beame    1.67495327387791
as running mates.   At the same time reaction among anti-organization    1.5636360329510388
Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's    1.5636360329510388
reported plan was generally favorable.   Some anti-organization    1.3761581156320553
Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal    1.6432600607208703
fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the    1.6432600607208703
last three years.   The resentment among Democratic organization    1.4513752902486308
leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at    1.5636360329510388
the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting    1.6065767145351917
the leaders. Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr& Wagner    1.6065767145351917
regarded himself as bigger than the party.    1.3761581156320553
Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to    1.5636360329510388
induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept& 7 Democratic    1.5636360329510388
primary.   These contend there is a serious question as to whether    1.6065767145351917
Mr& Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file    1.6065767145351917
in the city. Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing    1.67495327387791
to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of    1.6065767145351917
his performance as Mayor.   In an apparent effort to head off    1.6065767145351917
such a rival primary slate, Mr& Wagner talked by telephone yesterday    1.6065767145351917
with Representative Charles A& Buckley, the Bronx Democratic    1.4513752902486308
leader, and with Joseph T& Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic    1.5127085093302464
leader.    1.0
As usual, he made no attempt to get    1.4513752902486308
in touch with Carmine G& De Sapio, the Manhattan leader. He    1.6065767145351917
is publicly on record as believing Mr& De Sapio should be replaced    1.6432600607208703
for the good of the party.   Last night the Mayor visited Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation.    1.6432600607208703
Apparently he believes Mr& Buckley holds the key to the Democratic    1.6065767145351917
organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates    1.4513752902486308
without a struggle.   In talks with Mr& Buckley last week    1.5636360329510388
in Washington, the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent    1.5636360329510388
to dropping Controller Lawrence E& Gerosa, who lives in the    1.5636360329510388
Bronx, from this year's ticket. But Mr& Buckley seems to have    1.6065767145351917
assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr& Gerosa's successor.    1.6432600607208703
The Mayor declined in two interviews    1.2818970554302986
with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he    1.6065767145351917
had decided to run and wanted Mr& Screvane, who lives in Queens,    1.6432600607208703
to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the candidate for President    1.6065767145351917
of the City Council and Mr& Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, to    1.6432600607208703
replace Mr& Gerosa as the candidate for Controller.   The    1.5127085093302464
Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter    1.6432600607208703
College Campus in the Bronx. After his speech, reporters asked    1.5636360329510388
him about the report of his political intentions, published in yesterday's    1.6065767145351917
New York Times. The Mayor said:   "It didn't    1.4513752902486308
come from me. But as I have said before, if I announce my candidacy,    1.7026049541338664
I will have something definite to say about running mates".    1.5636360329510388
_BOSTON, JUNE 16_- A wave of public resentment against corruption    1.5636360329510388
in government is rising in Massachusetts.   There is a tangible    1.5636360329510388
feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics. The taxi driver    1.6065767145351917
taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state    1.6432600607208703
are "all the same".   "It's 'See Joe, see Jim'",    1.5127085093302464
he says. "The hand is out".   A political scientist writes    1.5636360329510388
of the growth of "alienated voters", who "believe that voting    1.5636360329510388
is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are    1.5636360329510388
corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control. **h These voters view the    1.6065767145351917
political process as a secret conspiracy, the object of which is to    1.6432600607208703
plunder them".   Corruption is hardly a recent development in    1.5127085093302464
the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin    1.67495327387791
O'Connor's novel, "The Last Hurrah". But there are reasons    1.5127085093302464
for the current spotlight on the subject.   A succession of    1.5636360329510388
highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year.    1.6065767145351917
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought    1.6432600607208703
on state and Federal investigations. And the election of President    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of    1.5636360329510388
his home state.   A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly    1.6065767145351917
escape the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the norm in    1.6432600607208703
Massachusetts    1.0
public life. Day after day some new episode is reported.   1.5636360329510388
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent    1.5636360329510388
$8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront    1.67495327387791
property. An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate.    1.5127085093302464
_WASHINGTON, JUNE 18_- Congress starts another week tomorrow with    1.5127085093302464
sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.   In the    1.5127085093302464
Senate, several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict    1.6065767145351917
or opposition. In the House, the Southern-Republican coalition is    1.5127085093302464
expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's    1.6065767145351917
housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an attempt    1.5636360329510388
to advance the aid-to-education bill.   The housing bill is now    1.5636360329510388
in the House Rules Committee. It is expected to be reported out Tuesday,    1.67495327387791
but this is a little uncertain.   The panel's action depends    1.5636360329510388
on the return of Representative James W& Trimble, Democrat    1.5127085093302464
of Arkansas, who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces    1.6065767145351917
in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor. Mr& Trimble    1.6432600607208703
has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday.    1.5636360329510388
The housing bill is expected to encounter strong    1.4513752902486308
opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative    1.5127085093302464
Republicans. The Democratic leadership, however, hopes to pass it    1.5127085093302464
sometime this week.   The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed    1.5127085093302464
last Monday by the Senate, provides for forty-year mortgages at low    1.6065767145351917
down-payments for moderate-income families. It also provides for funds    1.5127085093302464
to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories.   The education    1.5636360329510388
bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee,    1.5636360329510388
where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the    1.5636360329510388
Administration are balking because of the religious controversy. They    1.5127085093302464
are James J& Delaney of Queens and Thomas P& O'Neill Jr&    1.6065767145351917
of Massachusetts.    1.0
What could rescue    1.0
the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National    1.67495327387791
Defense Education Act of 1958. This would provide for long-term    1.5636360329510388
Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school    1.5127085093302464
facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.   1.3761581156320553
Mr& Delaney and Mr& O'Neill are not willing to vote on the    1.6432600607208703
public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House    1.5636360329510388
Education and Labor Committee.   1.0
About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary    1.5636360329510388
agencies will be carried out by religious groups, according to an official    1.6432600607208703
of the corps.   In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted    1.6065767145351917
for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent through    1.4513752902486308
universities and private voluntary agencies.   Twelve projects    1.3761581156320553
proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage, Gordon    1.5636360329510388
Boyce, director of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in    1.5636360329510388
a Washington interview. Six of these were proposed by religious groups.    1.6065767145351917
They will be for teaching, agriculture and community development    1.5127085093302464
in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.    1.5636360329510388
Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed    1.3761581156320553
that this development has raised the question whether the Peace    1.5636360329510388
Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over    1.6432600607208703
methods, means and goals.   There are a number of ways this could    1.6432600607208703
happen, the churchmen pointed out, and here is an example:    1.5636360329510388
Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came    1.6065767145351917
to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled. When he protested,    1.7269387314284994
the hotel owner said:   "Why do you worry? The    1.5127085093302464
U& S& Government is paying for it. The U& S& Government    1.6065767145351917
pays for all its overseas workers".    1.2818970554302986
"I don't work for the Government", the American    1.4513752902486308
said. "I'm a missionary".   The hotel owner shrugged.    1.4513752902486308
"Same thing", he said.   And then, some churchmen remarked,    1.5127085093302464
there is a more classical church-state problem:   Can religious    1.5127085093302464
agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their    1.5636360329510388
projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation    1.5127085093302464
of church and state?   R& Sargent Shriver Jr&, director    1.5127085093302464
of the corps, is certain that they can. No religious group, he    1.6432600607208703
declared in an interview, will receive Peace Corps funds unless it    1.6065767145351917
forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.    1.4513752902486308
_MOSCOW, JUNE 18_- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President    1.6432600607208703
Sukarno of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets    1.5127085093302464
and said, beaming: "Look, he took everything I had"!    1.5127085093302464
Mr& Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful    1.6065767145351917
banker. Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of    1.5636360329510388
Asia, Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid.   1.5636360329510388
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly    1.6432600607208703
expanding their economic, technical and military assistance to    1.4513752902486308
the uncommitted nations.   The Communist countries allocated more    1.4513752902486308
than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year, according to Western    1.6065767145351917
estimates. This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist    1.5636360329510388
program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning    1.5127085093302464
in 1954. In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present    1.6065767145351917
in those countries.    1.0
_UNITED NATIONS, N& Y&, JUNE 18_- A committee of experts has    1.6065767145351917
recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution    1.5636360329510388
of professional posts at the United Nations. This was disclosed    1.5636360329510388
today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet    1.6065767145351917
Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United    1.7026049541338664
Nations.   One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium    1.5636360329510388
on population instead of economic strength, as in the past, would    1.6065767145351917
be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries    1.67495327387791
as India. India is the most populous United Nations member with more    1.6432600607208703
than 400,000,000 inhabitants.   The new formula for filling    1.4513752902486308
staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations    1.6432600607208703
made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report. The report    1.7026049541338664
was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of    1.6432600607208703
the organization of the United Nations.    1.2818970554302986
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions    1.4513752902486308
is expected to receive the report this week. The jobs formula is    1.6432600607208703
understood to follow these lines: _@_ Each of the organization's    1.5127085093302464
ninety-nine members would get two professional posts, such as    1.5127085093302464
political affairs officer, a department head or an economist, to start.    1.6065767145351917
Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people    1.5636360329510388
in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts.    1.67495327387791
Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would    1.4513752902486308
get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to    1.6065767145351917
an unspecified cut-off point.    1.0
_GENEVA, JUNE 18_- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin    1.6432600607208703
negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would    1.5127085093302464
unite the war-ridden kingdom.   The decision was made in Zurich    1.5636360329510388
by Prince Boun Oum, Premier of the pro-Western royal Government;    1.5636360329510388
Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists    1.4513752902486308
and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and Prince Souphanouvong,    1.6065767145351917
head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces. The latter    1.5127085093302464
two are half-brothers.   Their    1.0
joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend    1.6065767145351917
tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference    1.5127085093302464
on the future of Laos. An agreement among the Princes on a coalition    1.67495327387791
government would ease their task, diplomats conceded. But no    1.5127085093302464
one was overly optimistic.    1.0

C& Green, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, concluded,    1.4513752902486308
meanwhile, a round of consultations here on future tactics in the    1.6065767145351917
conference. The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week.   1.6432600607208703
Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter,    1.3761581156320553
read the Princes' statement. They had a two-hour luncheon together    1.5636360329510388
in "an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation", she    1.5127085093302464
said.   The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for    1.5636360329510388
their talks, which are to last three days.   The Princess said    1.6065767145351917
it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached    1.7269387314284994
after three days.    1.0
The meetings in    1.0
Zurich, the statement said, would deal only with principles that would    1.6065767145351917
guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government.   1.6065767145351917
Appointment of William S& Pfaff Jr&, 41, as promotion    1.5127085093302464
manager    1.0
of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday    1.4513752902486308

Martin Burke, who resigned.   The new promotion manager    1.4513752902486308
has been employed by the company since January, 1946, as a commercial    1.6432600607208703
artist in the advertising department.   He is a native of New    1.6065767145351917
Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school, Fortier High school    1.5127085093302464
and Soule business    1.0
college.   From June, 1942, until December,    1.2818970554302986
1945, Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps. While in the service    1.6432600607208703
he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville, Ill&.   1.5636360329510388
Before entering the service, Pfaff for five years did clerical    1.5636360329510388
work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans.   1.6065767145351917
He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter,    1.6432600607208703
Karol, 13. They reside at 4911 Miles dr&.    1.4513752902486308
_WASHINGTON_- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected    1.4513752902486308
along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House    1.5636360329510388
for the big inaugural parade on Jan& 20.   Assuming the    1.5636360329510388
weather is halfway decent that day, hundreds of thousands of persons    1.6065767145351917
will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F& Kennedy    1.5636360329510388
and retiring President Dwight D& Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill    1.5127085093302464
following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial    1.5636360329510388
route.   Pennsylvania Avenue, named for one of the original    1.5127085093302464
13 states, perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District    1.6432600607208703
of Columbia from a commercial standpoint. But from a historic viewpoint    1.6065767145351917
none can approach it.    1.0
Within view of the    1.0
avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings,    1.5636360329510388
plus shrines and monuments. Of course, 1600 Pennsylvania, the    1.5127085093302464
White House, is the most famous address of the free world.    1.6065767145351917
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes    1.6065767145351917
together with Constitution Avenue, begins a series of great federal    1.5636360329510388
buildings, some a block long and all about seven-stories high.   1.5636360329510388
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue, now    1.6065767145351917
about 169 years old. In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand    1.7026049541338664
persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade. They were the suffragettes    1.6432600607208703
and they wanted to vote. In the 1920 presidential election    1.5636360329510388
they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time.    1.7026049541338664
Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from    1.4513752902486308
the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives    1.6432600607208703
building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable    1.5636360329510388
records are kept. Also the department of justice building is    1.5636360329510388
located where J& Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of    1.6065767145351917
investigation.   Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania,    1.5636360329510388
powered with lines that are underground.   Many spectators    1.4513752902486308
will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square,    1.5636360329510388
opposite the White House. In this historic square are several    1.5636360329510388
statutes, but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen&    1.7026049541338664
Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans.   Moving    1.5636360329510388
past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will    1.5127085093302464
be at least 40 marching units. About 16,000 military members of all    1.6432600607208703
branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade.   Division    1.6432600607208703
one of the parade will be the service academies. Division two will    1.6432600607208703
include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas, the respective    1.5127085093302464
states of the President and of Vice-President L& B& Johnson.    1.5636360329510388
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission    1.6432600607208703
to the union.   Division three will be headed by the Marines    1.6065767145351917
followed by 12 states; division four will be headed by the Navy,    1.6432600607208703
followed by 11 states; division five, by the Air Force followed    1.6065767145351917
by    1.0
11 states. Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard, followed    1.6432600607208703
by the reserve forces of all services, five states, Puerto Rico, the    1.6432600607208703
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the trust territories and    1.5127085093302464
the Canal Zone.    1.0
_JACKSON, MISS&_- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental    1.5636360329510388
developments in Mississippi?   Even for those who have    1.4513752902486308
been observing the political scene a long time, no script from the past    1.67495327387791
is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political    1.6065767145351917
future.   This is largely because of the unpredictability of the    1.5636360329510388
man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected    1.67495327387791
leader of its two million inhabitants- Gov& Ross Barnett.   1.5127085093302464
Barnett, who came into office with no previous experience in public    1.6065767145351917
administration, has surrounded himself with confusion which not only    1.5127085093302464
keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well.   Consequently,    1.5636360329510388
it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction    1.6432600607208703
the Barnett administration will take in the coming year.    1.5127085093302464
Some predict the administration will settle down during    1.4513752902486308
1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.    1.67495327387791
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady    1.67495327387791
stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments    1.6065767145351917
by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's    1.6432600607208703
office.   There are many who predict that should Barnett decide    1.5636360329510388
to call the Legislature back into special session, it will really    1.6065767145351917
throw his administration into a scramble.   Certainly nobody    1.4513752902486308
will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett    1.6432600607208703
will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful    1.6432600607208703
"honeymoon" he had in the 1960 legislative session.   If Barnett    1.5636360329510388
doesn't call a special session in 1961, it will be the first    1.6432600607208703
year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or    1.7026049541338664
special session.   The odds favor a special session, more than    1.5636360329510388
likely early in the year.    1.1606783668269585
Legislators always get    1.0
restless for a special session (whether for the companionship or the    1.6065767145351917
$22.50 per diem is not certain) and if they start agitating. Barnett    1.6432600607208703
is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.   The issue    1.6432600607208703
which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive    1.67495327387791
problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six    1.5127085093302464
to five to eliminate one congressional seat.   With eyes focused    1.5636360329510388
on the third congressional district, the historic Delta district, and    1.5636360329510388
Congressman Frank E& Smith as the one most likely to go, the redistricting    1.67495327387791
battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers    1.6065767145351917
from the Delta have held in the Legislature.   Mississippi's    1.5127085093302464
relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads    1.6065767145351917
during 1961, with the first Democratic president in eight years    1.5636360329510388
in the White House.   Split badly during the recent presidential    1.5636360329510388
election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and    1.5636360329510388
independents, the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck.    1.5636360329510388
And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.    1.7026049541338664
Barnett, as the titular head of the Democratic    1.4513752902486308
party, apparently must make the move to reestablish relations    1.5127085093302464
with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist    1.67495327387791
ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.    1.5127085093302464
With a Democratic administration, party patronage would normally begin    1.5127085093302464
to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity    1.6065767145351917
in the November election.   Now, the picture is clouded, and even    1.6065767145351917
~US Sens& James O& Eastland and John C& Stennis, who    1.5636360329510388
remained loyal to the ticket, are uncertain of their status.    1.5636360329510388
Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen    1.6432600607208703
from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped    1.6432600607208703
of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.    1.4513752902486308
_BATON ROUGE, LA&_- The Gov& Jimmie H& Davis administration    1.5127085093302464
appears to face a difficult year in 1961, with the governor's    1.6065767145351917
theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.   The    1.5636360329510388
year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome    1.6065767145351917
issue. But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue-    1.6065767145351917
that of finances in state government.   The transition from segregation    1.5636360329510388
to finances might already be in progress, in the form of an administration    1.67495327387791
proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3    1.67495327387791
per cent.   The administration has said the sales tax proposal    1.5636360329510388
is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the revenues from the    1.6432600607208703
increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.   But the    1.6432600607208703
tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused    1.5636360329510388
legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all    1.67495327387791
shortage of cash than to segregation.    1.2818970554302986
Indeed, the administration's curious position on the sales tax was    1.5636360329510388
a major factor in contributing to its defeat. The administration could    1.6065767145351917
not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.   1.6065767145351917
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies    1.6432600607208703
revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining    1.6432600607208703
whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.   The    1.5127085093302464
tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when    1.6432600607208703
the Legislature reconvenes.   Davis may use the tax bill as a    1.6065767145351917
means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature    1.6065767145351917
to normalcy.   If it fails to pass, he can throw up his hands and    1.7026049541338664
say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent    1.6432600607208703
integration. He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature.   1.5127085093302464
Actually,    1.0
Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.    1.5636360329510388
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing    1.6065767145351917
battle to block token integration.   This is not the sort    1.5636360329510388
of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly. They would    1.6065767145351917
like to convey the notion something is being done, even though it is    1.67495327387791
something they know to be ineffectual.    1.2818970554302986
Passage    1.0
of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect    1.67495327387791
a transition. He could tell the Legislature they had provided the    1.6065767145351917
needed funds to carry on the battle.   Then he could tell them to    1.67495327387791
go home, while the administration continued to wage the battle with    1.6065767145351917
the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in    1.67495327387791
over an eight months period.   It is difficult to be certain how    1.6432600607208703
the administration views that $28 million, since the views of one leader    1.6432600607208703
may not be the same as the views of another one.   But if    1.67495327387791
the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a    1.67495327387791
grant-in-aid program, a not unlikely conclusion, it could very well seek    1.6065767145351917
a way to use the money for other purposes.   This would be in    1.67495327387791
perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration-    1.5127085093302464
the shortage of cash. It could become an acute problem in the coming    1.67495327387791
fiscal year.   If the administration does not succeed in passing    1.5636360329510388
the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it could very well be    1.7026049541338664
faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting    1.67495327387791
dilemma.   Since the constitution forbids introduction    1.2818970554302986
of a tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will either have    1.67495327387791
to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.    1.6065767145351917
In either case, it could call a special session    1.5127085093302464
of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising    1.6432600607208703
additional revenues through a tax raiser.   The prospect of cutting    1.5636360329510388
back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor. It is one    1.6432600607208703
that most try to avoid, as long as they can see an alternative approach    1.7026049541338664
to the problem.   But if all alternatives should be clearly    1.5636360329510388
blocked    1.0
off, it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps    1.6065767145351917
to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.   1.6065767145351917
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by    1.67495327387791
the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature, so it would be more    1.67495327387791
receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.   A constant problem    1.6432600607208703
confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge    1.6432600607208703
by his foes that he has not tried to economize.   Any tax bill    1.67495327387791
also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using    1.6432600607208703
their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.   1.3761581156320553
The new year might see some house-cleaning, either genuine or    1.5636360329510388
token, depending upon developments, to give Davis an opportunity to    1.5636360329510388
combat some of these criticisms.   1.1606783668269585
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the    1.4513752902486308
bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage    1.6432600607208703
of a private contracting company which had "an inside track"    1.5636360329510388
with the city.   Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000    1.6065767145351917
job have ranged as high as $200,000.    1.3761581156320553
Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co& contracted to    1.5636360329510388
do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than    1.748515906000203
the "legitimate" bids of competing contractors.   The Hughes    1.4513752902486308
concern then took "shortcuts" on the project but got paid anyway,    1.6065767145351917
Hemphill said.   The Controller's charge of rigging was    1.4513752902486308
the latest development in an investigation which also brought these    1.5636360329510388
disclosures Tuesday:   {The city has sued for the full amount    1.5636360329510388
of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract.   The    1.5127085093302464
Philadelphia Transportation Co& is investigating the part its    1.4513752902486308
organization played in reviewing the project.   The signature of    1.5127085093302464

in the Department of Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers    1.5636360329510388
certifying work on the project. Varani has been fired on charges of    1.6432600607208703
accepting gifts from the contractor.   Managing Director Donald    1.4513752902486308
C& Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a    1.6065767145351917
period of sharp disagreement on the matter}.   The announcement    1.5127085093302464
that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made    1.67495327387791
by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following    1.5636360329510388
a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city    1.67495327387791
and the ~PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that    1.6432600607208703
was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959.    1.6065767145351917
The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries,    1.3761581156320553

the Federal bankruptcy law. On Monday, the Hughes concern was formally    1.6065767145351917
declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not    1.5127085093302464
draw up a plan for reorganization.   Business relations between    1.5127085093302464

direction, the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case    1.5636360329510388
in U& S& District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim    1.67495327387791
there.   "I am taking the position that the contract was clearly    1.6065767145351917
violated", Berger said.   The contract violations mostly    1.3761581156320553
involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along    1.5636360329510388
the El track. The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints.    1.6065767145351917
The city paid for work on 75, of which no more than 21 were repaired,    1.7269387314284994
Hemphill charged.    1.0
Hemphill said the Hughes    1.0
concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each    1.67495327387791
joint. The bid from A& Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass&,    1.6065767145351917
which listed the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.   1.6065767145351917
But, Hemphill added, bids from other contractors ranged from $2400    1.5636360329510388
to $3100 per joint.   Berger's decision to sue for the full    1.6065767145351917
amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning    1.6432600607208703
press conference. Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes    1.6432600607208703
company. "We won't know the full amount until we get a full    1.6432600607208703
report", Wagner said.   "We can claim on the maximum amount    1.5636360329510388
of the bond", Berger said.   Wagner replied, "Can't you    1.5127085093302464
Berger insisted that "we know enough to    1.3761581156320553
sue for the full amount".   Douglas M& Pratt, president of    1.5636360329510388
the ~PTC, who attended the meeting, said the transit company is    1.6065767145351917
reviewing the work on the El.   "We want to find out who knew    1.67495327387791
about it", Pratt said. "Certain people must have known about it".   1.6065767145351917
"The ~PTC is investigating the whole matter", Pratt    1.4513752902486308
said.   1.0
Samuel D& Goodis, representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association,    1.4513752902486308
objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing    1.6432600607208703
fees, saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged    1.5636360329510388
from 48 to 74 percent last year.   Goodis voiced his objection before    1.6432600607208703
City Council's Finance Committee.   For hotels with    1.3761581156320553
1000 rooms, the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000    1.6432600607208703
a year, Goodis said.    1.0
His testimony came    1.0
during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses,    1.7026049541338664
permits and city services. The new fees are expected to raise an additional    1.67495327387791
$740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year    1.6065767145351917
after that.   The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming    1.5636360329510388
houses, hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room. The cost of a    1.67495327387791
license now is $2, with an annual renewal fee of $1.   Goodis said    1.67495327387791
that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some    1.6432600607208703
hotels.    1.0
The city expects the higher rooming    1.2818970554302986
house, hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000    1.6432600607208703
a year.   The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan,    1.5636360329510388
spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia, on    1.5127085093302464
behalf of association members who operate apartment houses.   A    1.5127085093302464
proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman    1.6065767145351917
Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised pedigreed dogs. The ordinance    1.5127085093302464
would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat    1.7026049541338664
$5 a dog.    1.0
Mrs& Knauer said she did not    1.2818970554302986
think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal    1.6432600607208703
care.   In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R&    1.4513752902486308
Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license    1.6432600607208703
and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees.   He reported    1.6065767145351917
that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000    1.5127085093302464
to the Women's S&P&C&A&; $15,000 to pay six policemen    1.5127085093302464
assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites.    1.5636360329510388
City Finance Director Richard J& McConnell    1.2818970554302986
indorsed the higher fees, which, he said, had been under study for more    1.67495327387791
than a year. The city is not adequately compensated for the services    1.6432600607208703
covered by the fees, he said.   The new fee schedule also was    1.6432600607208703
supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman    1.5127085093302464
and Health Commissioner Eugene A& Gillis.   1.2818970554302986
Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian    1.5636360329510388
W& Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court    1.5636360329510388
Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A& Davenport, counsel    1.5636360329510388
for the widow of the man killed last Nov& 1 by Barnard's hit-run    1.67495327387791
car.   The petitions will be presented in open court to President    1.6065767145351917
Judge William F& Dannehower, Davenport said.   Barnard,    1.3761581156320553
who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges, was    1.5636360329510388
fined $500 by Judge Warren K& Hess, and placed on two years' probation    1.67495327387791
providing he does not drive during that time. He was caught    1.6065767145351917
driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning.   1.6432600607208703
Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery, 39. His    1.5636360329510388
widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded    1.5636360329510388
for violating the probation.   1.0
The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements    1.4513752902486308
between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase    1.5636360329510388
of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.   1.5127085093302464
The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate    1.5636360329510388
traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.   One of    1.5127085093302464
the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp& to purchase a 1311    1.6432600607208703
acre tract for $12,192,865. The tract is bounded by Island ave&,    1.6065767145351917
Dicks ave&, 61st st&, and Eastwick ave&.    1.3761581156320553
It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment    1.5636360329510388
Authority's master plan and will feature row houses, garden apartments,    1.5636360329510388
four small parks, schools, churches, a shopping center and several    1.5636360329510388
small clusters of stores.   The corporation was formed by the    1.5636360329510388
Reynolds Metal Co& and the Samuel A& and Henry A& Berger    1.6065767145351917
firm, a Philadelphia builder, for work in the project.   The second    1.6065767145351917
agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of    1.6065767145351917
Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp&,    1.4513752902486308
a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders, which is interested    1.6065767145351917
in developing part of the project.    1.2818970554302986
The plan    1.0
for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr&    1.5636360329510388
Constantinos A& Doxiadis, former Minister of Reconstruction    1.3761581156320553
in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp&.   1.6065767145351917
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would    1.6432600607208703
be barred to vehicular traffic. It provides for a series of landscaped    1.6432600607208703
walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through    1.5636360329510388
the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project.   1.5636360329510388
The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave&, which on original    1.4513752902486308
plans ran through the center of the development. The esplanade would    1.6065767145351917
feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project.    1.4513752902486308
_KANSAS CITY, MO&, FEB& 9 (~UPI)_- The president of the    1.5636360329510388
Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters    1.5636360329510388
was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left    1.7026049541338664
home for work.   Battalion Chief Stanton M& Gladden, 42,    1.5127085093302464
the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters    1.6065767145351917
association and the teamsters union, suffered multiple fractures    1.4513752902486308
of both ankles. He was in Baptist Memorial hospital.    1.5127085093302464
The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his    1.5636360329510388
1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that    1.7026049541338664
he could take his other car to work.   "I'd just turned on    1.6432600607208703
the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway",    1.7269387314284994
he said.   Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John,    1.5636360329510388
17, and Jim, 13, were inside the house. The younger boy said the blast    1.7026049541338664
knocked him out of bed and against the wall.    1.5127085093302464
The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of    1.67495327387791
the house. The left front wheel landed 100 feet away.   Police    1.6065767145351917
laboratory technicians said the explosive device, containing either ~TNT    1.5127085093302464
or nitroglycerine, was apparently placed under the left front    1.5127085093302464
wheel. It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter.   1.67495327387791
Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls    1.5127085093302464
in recent months and reportedly received one last night.   The    1.5636360329510388
fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving    1.6065767145351917
top personnel and the fight    1.1606783668269585
between the fire fighters association and the    1.3761581156320553
teamsters union.    1.0
Gladden has been an    1.0
outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's    1.6065767145351917
battle against the teamsters, which began organizing city firemen    1.5127085093302464
in 1959.   The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward    1.6065767145351917
for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible    1.6432600607208703
for the bombing. A $500 reward was offered by the association's    1.6065767145351917
local in Kansas City, Kas&.   The association said    1.4513752902486308
it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James    1.7026049541338664
Mining and Eugene Shiflett. Mining is secretary-treasurer of the    1.5127085093302464
local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee. Both have    1.6432600607208703
been active in the association.    1.1606783668269585
_ANKARA, TURKEY, OCT& 24 (~AP)_- Turkish political leaders    1.4513752902486308
bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national    1.6432600607208703
front government with Gen& Cemal Gursel as president.    1.4513752902486308
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive    1.6065767145351917
elections on Oct& 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political    1.6432600607208703
bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat.   By-passing    1.5636360329510388
the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow    1.5636360329510388
of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago, the army general staff,    1.6065767145351917
led by Gen& Cedvet Sunay, had set a deadline for the parties to    1.67495327387791
join in a national coalition government.   The army leaders threatened    1.5636360329510388
to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign    1.6432600607208703
an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen& Gursel as president. Gen&    1.6065767145351917
Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.    1.5636360329510388
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes    1.6432600607208703
in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime    1.7026049541338664
now in prison would be pardoned.   Party leaders came out of    1.6065767145351917
the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement    1.5636360329510388
had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections    1.67495327387791
which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its    1.67495327387791
own.   1.0
Vincent G& Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant    1.4513752902486308
district attorney, it was announced Monday by Charles E& Raymond,    1.5636360329510388
District Attorney.   Ierulli will replace Desmond D& Connall    1.4513752902486308
who has been called to active military service but is expected back    1.6432600607208703
on the job by March 31.   Ierulli, 29, has been practicing    1.6065767145351917
in Portland since November, 1959. He is a graduate of Portland University    1.6432600607208703

Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure    1.5127085093302464
is more important than aiding them economically, E& M& Martin,    1.5636360329510388
assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the    1.6065767145351917
World Affairs Council Monday night.   Martin, who has been    1.5127085093302464
in office in Washington, D& C&, for 13 months spoke at the    1.6432600607208703
council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel. He told some 350    1.6065767145351917
persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build    1.6065767145351917
their own societies their own ways, following their own paths.   1.5636360329510388
"We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which, if not identical,    1.7026049541338664
is congenial with ours", he said but adding that if they do    1.6432600607208703
not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality    1.67495327387791
and loyalty.    1.0
Insuring that the countries    1.0
have a freedom of choice, he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet    1.7026049541338664
Union.   He cited East Germany where after 15 years of    1.5636360329510388
Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people    1.7026049541338664
in, and added, "so long as people rebel, we must not give up".   1.67495327387791
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.   "The    1.5636360329510388
countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we    1.67495327387791
took a century to build", he said.   By leaving our doors open    1.6432600607208703
the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and    1.6432600607208703
to compare, he said.    1.0
"We have no reason    1.0
to fear failure, but we must be extraordinarily patient", the assistant    1.6065767145351917
secretary said.   Economically, Martin said, the United    1.3761581156320553
States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.    1.6065767145351917
Private business is more effective than government aid, he explained,    1.5636360329510388
because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.   1.5636360329510388
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of    1.6065767145351917
the country, at what he termed a "social cost".   Martin said    1.6065767145351917
the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary    1.6065767145351917
products which may involve the total income of one country.   1.5636360329510388
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive    1.6065767145351917
stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense    1.5127085093302464
more plans for the city's schools in event of attack.    1.5636360329510388
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board    1.7269387314284994
should go, and whose advice it should follow.   The board members,    1.6065767145351917
after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs& Ralph H&    1.5127085093302464
Molvar, 1409 ~SW Maplecrest Dr&, said they thought they had already    1.6065767145351917
been cooperating.   Chairman C& Richard Mears pointed    1.3761581156320553
out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem, in case    1.67495327387791
of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate so far as possible    1.67495327387791
to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.   1.6432600607208703
Dr& Melvin W& Barnes,    1.0
superintendent, said he thought the schools    1.2818970554302986
were waiting for some leadership, perhaps on the national level,    1.5636360329510388
to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would "be more    1.67495327387791
fruitful", and that he had found that other school districts were    1.6065767145351917
not as far along in their planning as this district.   "Los Angeles    1.6432600607208703
has said they would send the children to their homes in case of    1.67495327387791
disaster", he said. "Nobody really expects to evacuate. I think    1.5636360329510388
everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national    1.67495327387791
level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence    1.7026049541338664
in following.   Mrs& Molvar, who kept reiterating her request    1.5127085093302464
that they "please take a stand", said, "We must have faith    1.6065767145351917
in somebody- on the local level, and it wouldn't be possible for    1.6432600607208703
everyone to rush to a school to get their children".   Dr&    1.6065767145351917
Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans, even    1.6432600607208703
for a high school where there were lots of cars "might not be realistic    1.7026049541338664
and would not work".   Mrs& Molvar asked again that    1.5127085093302464
the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program.    1.67495327387791
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far    1.7026049541338664
and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.   1.6432600607208703
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board    1.6432600607208703
should be informed on what was done, is going to be done and what    1.7026049541338664
it thought should be done.    1.1606783668269585

and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a    1.5636360329510388
Monday night workshop session.   A bond issue which would have    1.5636360329510388

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their    1.6432600607208703
future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of    1.6432600607208703
the Assemblies of God, in session at the Memorial Coliseum.    1.5636360329510388
The council revised, in an effort to strengthen, the denomination's    1.5636360329510388
16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.   The changes, unanimously adopted,    1.5636360329510388
were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the    1.6432600607208703
Bible. The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in    1.6432600607208703
and dependence on the Bible.   At the adoption, the Rev& T&    1.6065767145351917
F& Zimmerman, general superintendent, commented, "The Assemblies    1.3761581156320553
of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days    1.6432600607208703
and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths of the Bible    1.6432600607208703
for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives".    1.67495327387791
Many changes involved minor editing and clarification;    1.3761581156320553
however, the first belief stood for entire revision with a    1.5636360329510388
new third point added to the list.   The first of 16 beliefs of    1.67495327387791
the denomination, now reads:   "The scriptures, both Old and    1.5127085093302464
New Testament, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation    1.6065767145351917
of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct".   1.6432600607208703
The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the Diety    1.5127085093302464
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and:  - emphasizes the Virgin    1.5127085093302464
birth  - the sinless life of Christ  - His miracles    1.4513752902486308
  - His substitutionary work on the cross  - His bodily    1.4513752902486308
resurrection from the dead  - and His exaltation to the right    1.5636360329510388
hand of God.    1.0
Friday afternoon the Rev&    1.0
T& F& Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year    1.5636360329510388
term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God. His offices    1.5636360329510388
are in Springfield, Mo&. Election came on the nominating ballot.   1.5636360329510388
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming    1.5636360329510388
program, "Breakthrough" scheduled to fill the churches for the    1.5127085093302464
next two years. In his opening address Wednesday the Rev& Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Zimmerman, urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program,    1.5636360329510388
with "Breakthrough" the theme for the first two years.    1.5127085093302464
The Rev& R& L& Brandt, national secretary of the home missions    1.6065767145351917
department, stressed the need for the first two years' work.   1.5636360329510388
"Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact    1.6065767145351917
with the church. This means that more than 100 million have no vital    1.67495327387791
touch with the church or religious life", he told delegates Friday.    1.6065767145351917
Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards    1.3761581156320553
of 12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering the United    1.6065767145351917
States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said "our organization has not    1.5636360329510388
been keeping pace with this challenge".   "In 35 years we have    1.6065767145351917
opened 7,000 churches", the Rev& Mr& Brandt said, adding that    1.5636360329510388
the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000    1.6432600607208703
persons.   "In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois,    1.5636360329510388
where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we have 60;    1.6432600607208703
we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none", he said.   To step    1.67495327387791
up the denomination's program, the Rev& Mr& Brandt suggested    1.5127085093302464
the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10    1.67495327387791
years.   To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods,    1.5636360329510388
"The church's    1.0
ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet    1.67495327387791
the challenge of this hour".   A capsule view of proposed plans    1.6065767145351917
includes:  - Encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies    1.4513752902486308
of God churches to start new churches.  - Engaging    1.4513752902486308
mature, experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population    1.6432600607208703
centers.  - Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational    1.2818970554302986
volunteers (laymen, who will be urged to move into the area of new    1.67495327387791
churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project).    1.6432600607208703
  - Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months    1.5127085093302464
as apprentices in well-established churches.   1.1606783668269585
U&S& Dist& Judge Charles L& Powell denied all motions    1.5127085093302464
made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud    1.5127085093302464
trial.   Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance, mistrial,    1.5127085093302464
separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony and directed    1.4513752902486308
verdict.   In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated    1.5127085093302464
that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that    1.67495327387791
"a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators    1.67495327387791
are".   Attorney Dwight L& Schwab, in behalf of    1.4513752902486308
defendant Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein    1.5636360329510388
to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared this is a matter    1.6065767145351917
for the jury to decide.    1.1606783668269585
Schwab also declared    1.0
there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the    1.6432600607208703
U&S& mails to defraud, to which federal prosecutor A& Lawrence    1.5636360329510388
Burbank replied:   "It is not necessary that a defendant    1.5127085093302464
actually have conpired to use the U&S& mails to defraud as long    1.6432600607208703
as there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were then used    1.67495327387791
to carry it out".   In the afternoon, defense attorneys began    1.5636360329510388
the presentation of their cases with opening statements, some of which    1.6065767145351917
had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and    1.6065767145351917
presented its case.    1.0
_MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction    1.5636360329510388
of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League    1.5636360329510388
clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision,    1.5636360329510388
this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3.   1.7026049541338664
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds    1.67495327387791
were to end their victory draought as they coasted along with a 3-to-o    1.67495327387791
advantage.    1.0
Over the first five frames, Jack    1.2818970554302986
Fisher, the big righthandler who figures to be in the middle of    1.6432600607208703
Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held    1.6432600607208703
the ~A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.   Then    1.5127085093302464
Dick Hyde, submarine-ball hurler, entered the contest and only    1.5127085093302464
five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock.   1.6432600607208703
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill    1.6432600607208703
Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the    1.7026049541338664
Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts.    1.3761581156320553
With one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole    1.67495327387791
second as Hyde fanned Tuttle. Catcher Frank House's throw    1.5127085093302464
in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt.   Then    1.67495327387791
Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled up the middle and    1.5636360329510388
Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run.   1.6065767145351917
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of    1.5636360329510388
the ninth and gave up the ~A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman    1.7269387314284994
Dick Howser, a wild pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under    1.5636360329510388
Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center.   The Orioles    1.4513752902486308
once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion, gathering    1.5636360329510388
only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers. Three    1.6432600607208703
were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding    1.5636360329510388
one.    1.0
Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed    1.2818970554302986
Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach    1.67495327387791
to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.   1.6065767145351917
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before    1.7026049541338664
Hartman took over in the top of the fourth. Hartman, purchased    1.6065767145351917
by the ~A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall, allowed no hits    1.6432600607208703
in his scoreless three-inning appearance, and merited the triumph.   1.5127085093302464
Keegan, a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder, gave up the Orioles' last    1.5127085093302464
two safeties over the final three frames, escaping a load of trouble    1.6432600607208703
in the ninth when the Birds threatened but    1.4513752902486308
failed to tally.    1.0
In the ninth, Robinson led off with his second    1.5127085093302464
double of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left.   1.7026049541338664
Whitey Herzog, performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly    1.5636360329510388
their strongest team of the spring, worked Keegan for a base on    1.6432600607208703
balls.   Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce.   1.4513752902486308
Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing in a bunt    1.67495327387791
attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back of short.   John    1.6065767145351917
Powell, batting for Adair, fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches,    1.6065767145351917
and Buddy Barker, up for Stepanovich, bounced out sharply to    1.5636360329510388
Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest.   1.5127085093302464
The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding, along with    1.67495327387791
Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right    1.67495327387791
center, moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed    1.6432600607208703
on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.   1.6432600607208703
The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits    1.7026049541338664
after two were out.   Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole    1.6065767145351917
at short to start the rally.    1.2818970554302986
Jim Gentile bounced    1.0
a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single, and    1.7026049541338664
when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's    1.6432600607208703
head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.   1.5636360329510388
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both    1.6432600607208703
runners. When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple, he    1.6432600607208703
was cut down in a close play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey.    1.67495327387791
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went    1.6432600607208703
like this:   Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde    1.67495327387791
and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet    1.6065767145351917
over the scoreboard in right center.    1.2818970554302986
Carey singled    1.0
on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field    1.6432600607208703
and threw wide to first. It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.   1.7026049541338664
Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play. Breeding    1.5127085093302464
to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the    1.6065767145351917
wall in left center.   If the Orioles are to break their losing    1.6432600607208703
streak within the next two days, it will have to be at the expense    1.7026049541338664
of the American League champion New York Yankees, who come in here    1.6432600607208703
tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon.    1.6065767145351917
_MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida    1.5127085093302464
Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles    1.5636360329510388
were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under    1.5636360329510388
the Army's military training program and is ready for belated    1.5636360329510388
spring training.   Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of    1.5636360329510388
22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average, completes the    1.7026049541338664
Birds' spring squad at 49 players.   The big, 22-year-old    1.5127085093302464
shortstop, the 1960 American league "rookie-of-the year", flew here    1.5127085093302464
late this afternoon from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated    1.6065767145351917

City- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row.    1.5127085093302464
The 6-foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds,    1.6065767145351917
15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring. He hopes    1.6065767145351917
to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three    1.67495327387791
weeks hence.   When he was inducted into the Army at Fort    1.6065767145351917
Knox, Ky&, Hansen's weight had dropped to 180- "too light    1.5636360329510388
for me to be at my best" he said.   "I feel good physically",    1.67495327387791
Hansen added, "but I think I'll move better carrying a little    1.6065767145351917
less weight than I'm carrying now".    1.2818970554302986
The rangy, Albany (Cal&) native, a surprise slugging    1.4513752902486308
sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz, set    1.67495327387791
"improved fielding" as his 1961 goal.   1.2818970554302986
"I think I can do a better job with the glove, now that I    1.7026049541338664
know the hitters around the league a little better", he said.   1.6065767145351917
Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to    1.6432600607208703
the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New    1.6432600607208703

fall than did Hansen.   Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent    1.4513752902486308
now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and    1.5636360329510388

"Take a ride on this one", Brooks Robinson greeted    1.5127085093302464
Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed for the plate    1.67495327387791
and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield    1.5127085093302464
wall tonight.   It was the first of two doubles by Robinson,    1.6065767145351917
who was in a mood to celebrate.   Just before game time, Robinson's    1.6432600607208703
pretty wife, Connie informed him that an addition to the family    1.6065767145351917
can be expected late next summer.   Unfortunately, Brooks'    1.4513752902486308
teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before    1.6432600607208703
Hansen arrived just before nightfall, two hours late, in company    1.5636360329510388

_CLEVELAND, MARCH 17 (~AP)_- George Kerr, the swift-striding    1.4513752902486308
Jamaican, set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus    1.7026049541338664
track meet tonight, beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot    1.5636360329510388
duel in 1.10.1.   Kerr, who set the world record earlier this month    1.6432600607208703
in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3, wiped out Mills's early    1.6432600607208703
pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards. Both    1.67495327387791
were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield.   1.67495327387791
Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of    1.67495327387791
the race. Then Kerr, a graduate student from Illinois, moved past    1.6065767145351917
him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn.    1.67495327387791
Mills was timed in 1.10.4.   The crowd at the twenty-first    1.5636360329510388
annual K& of C& Games, final indoor meet of the season, got a    1.67495327387791
thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender, bespectacled woman broke    1.6065767145351917

_SAN FRANCISCO, MARCH 17 (~AP)_- Bobby Waters of Sylvania,    1.5127085093302464

game of the 1960 season. While working out in Sylvania a swelling    1.6432600607208703
developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician._ST&    1.67495327387791

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the    1.5636360329510388
team's plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference    1.5127085093302464
scoring after three games.   Time stands still every time Moritz,    1.5636360329510388
a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field. Although    1.6065767145351917
he never gets to play while the clock is running, he gets a big    1.7026049541338664
kick- several every Saturday, in fact- out of football.    1.5127085093302464
Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of    1.7026049541338664
the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily    1.6432600607208703
favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.   That's    1.5127085093302464
because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries. He ran    1.67495327387791
his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before    1.6065767145351917
one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington    1.6432600607208703
State.   Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right    1.6065767145351917
halfback, the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team. But    1.6432600607208703
ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the    1.6432600607208703
quick response, "place-kicker".   A 208-pound, 6-foot 1-inch    1.3761581156320553
senior from Stamford, Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking. Last    1.5127085093302464
year, when he worked out at halfback all season, he didn't get    1.6432600607208703
into a single game.   "This year, coach Royal told me if I'd    1.6432600607208703
work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me", said Moritz.    1.6432600607208703
"So I started practicing on it in spring training.   Moritz    1.5636360329510388
was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle    1.67495327387791
in the thigh of his right (kicking) leg and, as a result, several of    1.7026049541338664
his successful conversions have gone barely far enough.   Moritz    1.5127085093302464
said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a result, he hopes to start    1.7026049541338664
practicing field goals this week. He kicked several while playing at    1.6065767145351917
Stamford High School, including one that beat Anson, 3-0, in a 1953    1.6432600607208703
district game.   "I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries    1.6065767145351917
during three years in high school", he said, "and made 26 in a    1.67495327387791
row at one time. I never did miss one in a playoff game- I kicked    1.7269387314284994
about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years".   Moritz    1.6432600607208703
came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered    1.6432600607208703
by a knee injury. He missed the 1955 season because of an operation    1.67495327387791
on    1.0
the ailing knee, then played 77 minutes in 1956. His statistical record    1.6432600607208703
that year, when Texas won only one game and lost nine, was far from    1.7026049541338664
impressive: he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10    1.67495327387791
yards, punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards.   1.67495327387791
He went into the Army in March, 1957, and returned two years later.    1.67495327387791
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present    1.5636360329510388
last season.   Place kicking is largely a matter of timing, Moritz    1.6065767145351917
declared.   "Once you get the feel of it, there's not much    1.6065767145351917
to it. I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some    1.7269387314284994
of them can't seem to get the feel. Practice helps you to get your    1.7026049541338664
timing down.   "It's kind of like golf- if you don't    1.5636360329510388
swing a club very often, your timing gets off".   Moritz, however,    1.6065767145351917
kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session.   1.6432600607208703
"If you kick too much, your leg gets kinda dead", he    1.6065767145351917
explained. @ _FOOTNOTES:_ In their first three games, the Longhorns    1.5127085093302464
have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times, or 40 per cent    1.7026049541338664
**h their total passing yardage in three games, 447 on 30 completions    1.6432600607208703
in 56 attempts, is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage    1.67495327387791
in 1959, when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries **h. Tailback    1.7026049541338664
James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant    1.6065767145351917
sophomore season, when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries; he    1.6065767145351917
now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games **h. Saxton has made    1.7026049541338664
only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington    1.6432600607208703
State game, for four plays: he returned the kickoff 30 yards,    1.6065767145351917
gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown    1.6432600607208703
run before retiring to the bench **h. Wingback Jack Collins injured    1.6065767145351917
a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready    1.6432600607208703
for Oklahoma **h. Last week, when Royal was informed that three    1.6065767145351917
Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing, he said:    1.6065767145351917
"That won't last long". It didn't; Monday, he had four    1.5636360329510388
Longhorns in the top four **h.   1.2818970554302986
A good feeling prevailed on the ~SMU coaching staff Monday,    1.5636360329510388
but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's    1.5636360329510388
problem: Rice University. The Mustangs don't play this    1.4513752902486308
week.   "We're just real happy for the players", Coach Bill    1.5636360329510388
Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy. "I    1.6432600607208703
think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight    1.7269387314284994
week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on. It was    1.6432600607208703
the first time we've been ahead this season (when John Richey kicked    1.6432600607208703
what proved to be the winning field goal)".   Assistant coach    1.5636360329510388
John Cudmore described victory as "a good feeling, I think, on    1.6065767145351917
the part of the coaches and the players. We needed it and we got it".   1.7269387314284994
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive    1.3761581156320553
performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon. Both    1.5636360329510388
turned in top jobs for the second straight game.   "Nelson played    1.6065767145351917
magnificent football", Meek praised. "He knocked down the interference    1.5127085093302464
and made key stops lots of times. And he caused the fumble    1.6432600607208703
that set up our touchdown. He broke that boy (Air Force fullback Nick    1.67495327387791
Arshinkoff) in two and knocked him loose from the football".   1.5636360329510388
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts    1.5127085093302464
in the late stages.   One was on a fourth-down screen pass from    1.6432600607208703
the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory.   1.5636360329510388
"As soon as it started to form, Gannon spotted it", Meek    1.6065767145351917
said. "He timed it just right and broke through there before the    1.6432600607208703
boy (halfback Terry Isaacson) had time to turn around. He really crucified    1.6432600607208703
him **h he nailed it for a yard loss".   The Air Force's,    1.6432600607208703
and the game's, final play, was a long pass by quarterback    1.6065767145351917
Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned    1.6065767145351917
22 yards.   "He just lay back there and waited for it", Meek    1.6432600607208703
said. "He almost brought it back all the way".   Except    1.5636360329510388
for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice, Meek expects    1.6065767145351917
the squad to be physically sound for Rice.   "Kelsey is    1.5636360329510388
very doubtful for the Rice game", Meek said. "He'll be out of    1.6432600607208703
action all this week. He got hit from the blind side by the split end    1.7269387314284994
coming back on the second play of the game. There is definitely some    1.67495327387791
ligament damage in his knee".   Rice has not played since injuring    1.6065767145351917
a knee in the opener with Maryland.   "He's looking    1.5127085093302464
a lot better, and he's able to run", Meek explained. "We'll    1.6065767145351917
let him do a lot of running this week, but I don't know if he'll    1.7269387314284994

Monday, ran for 30 minutes, then went in, while the reserves scrimmaged    1.6432600607208703
for 45 minutes.   "We'll work hard Tuesday, Wednesday    1.4513752902486308

The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory    1.6065767145351917
in four American Football League starts- a 19-12 triumph over    1.5636360329510388
the Denver Broncos- but their visit will be a short one.    1.6065767145351917
The Texans have two more road games- at Buffalo and Houston-    1.6065767145351917
before they play for the home folks again, and it looks as if coach Hank    1.7269387314284994
Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into    1.6432600607208703
the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings.   1.6432600607208703
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey, who has become one of the game's    1.6065767145351917
greatest collectors of quarterbacks, apparently now has found a productive    1.5636360329510388
pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers, M& C& Reynolds    1.5127085093302464
and Warren Rabb.   Rabb, the former Louisiana State    1.4513752902486308
field general, came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday    1.67495327387791
and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston    1.67495327387791
Oilers, defending league champions.   "Just our luck"! exclaimed    1.4513752902486308
Stram. "Buster would solve that quarterback problem just    1.4513752902486308
as we head that way".   Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about    1.7026049541338664
himself, for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid    1.5636360329510388
effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous    1.6432600607208703
Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star, Jack Spikes, though    1.6065767145351917
he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury.   1.5636360329510388
"Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well",    1.5127085093302464
said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the    1.6432600607208703
game. "In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job".    1.6065767145351917
The Texans won the game through ball control, with Quarterback Cotton    1.6065767145351917
Davidson throwing only 17 passes.   "We always like to keep    1.5636360329510388
the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an    1.7026049541338664
explosive attack", explained Stram. "They can be going along,    1.5127085093302464
doing little damage, then bang, bang- they can hit a couple of passes    1.67495327387791
on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble".   The Broncs    1.6065767145351917
did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans, but    1.67495327387791
Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off.   The principal    1.6432600607208703
tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes, the flashy    1.67495327387791
halfback. He was called upon 26 times- more than all of the other    1.67495327387791
ball-carriers combined- and delivered 145 yards.   The Texans    1.4513752902486308
made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's    1.6065767145351917
Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson,    1.6065767145351917
the speedy halfback, hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed    1.5636360329510388
it for Dallas. A quick touchdown resulted.   "That permitted    1.5127085093302464
us to start controlling the ball right away", said Stram, quipping,    1.6065767145351917
"I think I'll put that play in the book".   1.5127085093302464
The early Southwest Conference football leaders- Texas, Arkansas    1.4513752902486308
and Texas ~A+~M- made a big dent in the statistics last    1.6065767145351917
week.   Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave    1.4513752902486308
the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards (1,065 rushing    1.6065767145351917
and 447 passing) a new ~SWC high.   Arkansas combined 280    1.5636360329510388
yards rushing with 64 yards passing (on 5 completions in 7 tosses) and    1.67495327387791
a tough defense to whip ~TCU, and ~A+~M, with a 38-point    1.6065767145351917
bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950.    1.67495327387791
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards, the Aggies had a total    1.67495327387791
offense of 361 yards.   Texas leads in per-game rushing averages,    1.5636360329510388
355 yards, and passing 149 (to Baylor's 126), but idle Baylor has    1.6432600607208703
the best defensive record (187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189).    1.6065767145351917
~A+~M has the best defense against passes, 34.7 yards per game.   1.6065767145351917
Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness    1.5127085093302464
of baseballs currently in use, the major leagues have ordered their own    1.6432600607208703
tests, which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   1.5636360329510388
{Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday    1.4513752902486308
night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis, 5-3}.   1.6065767145351917
The husky 6-3, 205-pound lefthander, was in command all the    1.5636360329510388
way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television    1.6432600607208703
viewers in the Denver area.   It was Nischwitz' third    1.5127085093302464
straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning    1.6065767145351917
streak to four straight. They now lead Louisville by a full game on    1.67495327387791
top of the American Association pack.   {Nischwitz fanned six    1.5127085093302464
and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning. He has given    1.6432600607208703
only the one pass in his 27 innings, an unusual characteristic for a    1.67495327387791
southpaw}.   The Bears took the lead in the first inning, as    1.6065767145351917
they did in Sunday's opener, and never lagged.   Dick McAuliffe    1.5636360329510388
cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph    1.6065767145351917
to open the Bear's attack. After Al Paschal gruonded out, Jay    1.6065767145351917
Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe. Alusik then    1.5636360329510388
moved Cooke across with a line drive to left. Jay Porter drew a    1.67495327387791
base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked    1.67495327387791
down by Rudolph for the putout.   The Bears added two more in    1.6432600607208703
the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner,    1.6065767145351917
Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil    1.6065767145351917
Shartzer's glove.   {Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter    1.4513752902486308
when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the    1.7026049541338664
sixth. Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner, Cliff Cook    1.5636360329510388
and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infielder roller accounted    1.5127085093302464

on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert.   1.5636360329510388
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis    1.6432600607208703
run in the ninth.   Despite the 45-degree weather the game    1.5636360329510388
was clicked off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and some    1.7026049541338664
good infield play.   Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's    1.6065767145351917
grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some    1.67495327387791
good stops and showed a strong arm at third base.    1.5636360329510388

line double, which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left    1.6065767145351917
field, drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the    1.7026049541338664
last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the    1.7026049541338664
Chicago White Sox Monday}.   Lemon was on with his fourth    1.5636360329510388
single of the game, a liner to center. He came all the way around on    1.7269387314284994
Gardner's hit before 5777 fans. It was Gardner's second run batted    1.6065767145351917
in of the game and his only ones of the year.   Turk Lown    1.67495327387791
was tagged with the loss, his second against no victories, while Ray    1.6432600607208703
Moore won his second game against a single loss.   The Twins tied    1.6432600607208703
the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high    1.67495327387791
chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left.   1.6432600607208703
The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on    1.7269387314284994
a pair of pop fly hits- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo    1.7269387314284994
Carreon- a walk and a sacrifice fly.   Jim Landis' 380-foot    1.5636360329510388
home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead,    1.7026049541338664
but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his    1.67495327387791
second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.   1.6065767145351917
Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth- his fourth homer    1.6065767145351917
of the campaign- tied the score and Carreon's first major league    1.6065767145351917
home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front.   A double by    1.7026049541338664
Green, Allison's run-scoring 2-baser, an infield single by Lemon    1.5127085093302464
and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front    1.6432600607208703

_OGDEN, UTAH, MAY 1- (~AP)_- Boston Red Sox Outfielder    1.5127085093302464
Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball.   1.5636360329510388
"I've had it", he told a newsman. "I know when my reflexes    1.6432600607208703
are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club".   1.7269387314284994
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout.   1.6065767145351917
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average    1.67495327387791
in the first 12 games.   He took a midnight train out of Cleveland    1.67495327387791
Saturday, without an official word to anybody, and has stayed    1.5636360329510388
away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno, Nev&,    1.67495327387791
where his wife, former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen,    1.5636360329510388
awaited.   She said, when she learned Jackie was heading home:    1.5636360329510388
"I'm just speculating, but I have to think Jack feels he's    1.6065767145351917
hurting Boston's chances".   The Union Pacific Railroad    1.3761581156320553
streamliner, City of San Francisco, stopped in Ogden, Utah, for    1.5636360329510388
a few minutes. Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard    1.6065767145351917
Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.   The conductor    1.6065767145351917
said to Ritchie: "I don't think you want to talk to him.    1.6432600607208703
You'll probably get a ball bat on the head. He's mad at the    1.67495327387791
world".   But Jackie had gone into the station. Ritchie walked    1.5636360329510388
up to him at the magazine stand.   "I told him who I was and    1.7026049541338664
he was quite cold. But he warmed up after a while. I told him what    1.7269387314284994
Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything    1.67495327387791
he (Liston) got was through a keyhole. He said he had never    1.6432600607208703
talked to Liston".   Liston is Bill Liston, baseball writer    1.5127085093302464
for the Boston Traveler, who quoted Jensen as saying:    1.5127085093302464
"I    1.0
can't hit anymore. I can't run. I can't throw. Suddenly my    1.6065767145351917

And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren    1.6065767145351917
Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants'    1.6065767145351917
Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree    1.4513752902486308
Sunday.   Both, of course, were remarkable feats and further embossed    1.5636360329510388
the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime.   1.5127085093302464
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching    1.5636360329510388
probably reached the most hearts.   It was a real stimulant    1.5636360329510388
to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone.    1.7026049541338664
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked, "Wish    1.5636360329510388

Enos Slaughter, another all-out guy, who played rightfield that    1.5127085093302464
day and popped one over the clubhouse.   The spectacular Mays,    1.5636360329510388
who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25, joined six other    1.7026049541338664
sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.   1.6432600607208703
{Incidentally, only two did it before a home audience. Bobby Lowe    1.6065767145351917

which boils down to a matter of opinion, depending on whether you're    1.6432600607208703
an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee. The record    1.6065767145351917
books, however, would favor the Giants' ace.   In four of his    1.6065767145351917
nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as    1.7026049541338664
many as 25 bases. Once the figure was 30-30. Willie's lifetime batting    1.6432600607208703
average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's.   {The    1.5127085093302464
Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick    1.6432600607208703
Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park. It will forever    1.6065767145351917
be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after    1.6432600607208703
{THE DENVER-AREA ~TV}    1.0
audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs, thanks to a    1.6432600607208703
new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked    1.7026049541338664
out when his Bears are playing at home.   This rule providing    1.6065767145351917
for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of    1.6432600607208703
a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top    1.7026049541338664
rulers.   {The last couple of years the Bears management got    1.5636360329510388
the business from the "Living Room Athletic Club" when games    1.5636360329510388
were cut off. Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide    1.67495327387791
policy}.   This year, I am told, the ~CBS network    1.5127085093302464
will continue to abide by the rule but ~NBC will play to a conclusion    1.7026049541338664
here. There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation    1.5636360329510388
will arise.   It is an irritable rule that does baseball more    1.6065767145351917
harm than good, especially at the minor league level. You would be surprised    1.67495327387791
how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last    1.5636360329510388
year because of the television policy.   This dissatisfaction led    1.5127085093302464
to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end    1.6432600607208703
of the game.    1.0
_CINCINNATI, OHIO (~AP)_- The powerful New York Yankees    1.4513752902486308
won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati,    1.6432600607208703
crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely    1.6432600607208703
played finale.   With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both    1.5127085093302464
out of action due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted    1.6432600607208703
a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers,    1.5636360329510388
the most ever used by one team in a series game.   Johnny Blanchard,    1.67495327387791
Mantle's replacement, slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed    1.5636360329510388
loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning. Hector Lopez, subbing    1.6065767145351917
for Berra, smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run    1.6432600607208703
explosion in the fourth.   The Yanks also took advantage of    1.5636360329510388
three Cincinnati errors.   The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances    1.6065767145351917
to applaud.   In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long    1.5636360329510388
home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center, about    1.67495327387791
400 feet away, with two men on. Momentarily the Reds were back in    1.67495327387791
the ball game, trailing only 6-3, but the drive fizzled when John Edwards    1.67495327387791
fouled out with men on second and third and two out.   In    1.6432600607208703
the fifth, Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley, but by    1.67495327387791
that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter.   The    1.6432600607208703
Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team    1.67495327387791
to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a    1.7269387314284994
manager. Only Bucky Harris, the "boy-manager" of Washington in    1.5127085093302464
1924, and Eddie Dyer of the St& Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished    1.67495327387791
the feat.    1.0
_PHILADELPHIA, JAN& 23_- Nick Skorich, the line coach for the    1.5636360329510388
football champion Philadelphia Eagles, was elevated today to head    1.5127085093302464
coach.   Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed    1.5636360329510388
to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year. He succeeds Buck Shaw,    1.6432600607208703
who retired at the end of last season.   The appointment was    1.6065767145351917
announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain    1.6432600607208703
two members of Shaw's staff- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer.   1.5636360329510388
Williams is a defensive coach. Gauer works with the ends.    1.5636360329510388
The selection had been expected. Skorich    1.2818970554302986
was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin    1.6432600607208703
permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings,    1.6065767145351917
the newest National Football League entry.   Van Brocklin,    1.4513752902486308
the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title, was signed by the    1.67495327387791
Vikings last Wednesday. Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better    1.5636360329510388
connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end    1.6065767145351917
his career as a player.   With Skorich at the helm, the Eagles    1.6432600607208703
are expected to put more emphasis on running, rather than passing. In    1.6432600607208703
the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials.   1.5636360329510388
Skorich, however, is a strong advocate of a balanced attack- split    1.6065767145351917
between running and passing.    1.0
Skorich,    1.0
who is 39 years old, played football at Cincinnati University and    1.6065767145351917
then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland    1.6432600607208703
with the Pittsburgh Steelers.   An injury forced Skorich    1.4513752902486308
to quit after the 1948 season. He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh    1.67495327387791
Central Catholic High School in 1949. He remained there    1.5127085093302464
for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute    1.5127085093302464
in Troy, N& Y&. He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers    1.67495327387791
as an assistant coach.   Four years later he resigned to    1.5636360329510388
take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers. The Eagles signed    1.6432600607208703
him for Shaw's staff in 1959.   Skorich began his new job auspiciously    1.6432600607208703
today. At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson    1.6065767145351917
Dilworth, the Eagles were honored for winning the championship.   1.5127085093302464
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches and team    1.6065767145351917
officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation    1.6065767145351917
and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football.   1.5636360329510388
With the announcement of a "special achievement award" to    1.5127085093302464
William A& (Bill) Shea, the awards list was completed yesterday    1.5636360329510388
for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New    1.6065767145351917
York Chapter, Baseball Writers' Association of America, at the    1.5127085093302464
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.   Shea, the chairman of Mayor Wagner's    1.4513752902486308
Baseball Committee, will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn,    1.6065767145351917
the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves; Frank Graham,    1.5636360329510388
the Journal-American sports columnist; Bill Mazeroski, the    1.3761581156320553
World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Casey Stengel,    1.5636360329510388
the former manager of the Yankees.   Stengel will receive the    1.5636360329510388
Ben Epstein Good Guy Award. Mazeroski, whose homer beat the Yankees    1.6065767145351917
in the final series game, will receive the Babe Ruth Award as    1.6432600607208703
the outstanding player in the 1960 world series.   Graham will    1.5636360329510388
be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the    1.6432600607208703
William J& Slocum Memorial Award. To Spahn will go the Sid    1.6065767145351917
Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year.    1.5636360329510388
A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies,    1.5127085093302464
which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon    1.67495327387791
baseball personalities in skit, dance and song.   The 53-year-old    1.5127085093302464
Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background,    1.5127085093302464
is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return    1.6432600607208703
of a National League club to New York. Named by Mayor Wagner    1.6432600607208703
three years ago    1.0
to head a committee that included James A& Farley,    1.5127085093302464
Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea worked relentlessly.   1.4513752902486308
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city. The    1.67495327387791
departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York    1.6432600607208703
with only the Yankees.   Despite countless barriers and disappointments,    1.5127085093302464
Shea moved forward. When he was unable to bring about    1.5636360329510388
immediate expansion, he sought to convince another National League    1.5127085093302464
club to move here.   When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's    1.6065767145351917
aid in the formation of a third major league, the Continental,    1.6065767145351917
with New York as the key franchise. The Continental League never    1.6065767145351917
got off the ground, but after two years it forced the existing majors    1.67495327387791
to expand.    1.0
The New York franchise    1.0
is headed by Mrs& Charles Shipman Payson. A big-league municipal    1.5636360329510388
stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works, and once the lease    1.67495327387791
is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner    1.6065767145351917
Ford C& Frick. Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new    1.5636360329510388
stadium.   Shea and his wife, Nori, make their home at Sands    1.6065767145351917
Point, L& I&. Bill Jr&, 20; Kathy, 15, and Patricia,    1.5636360329510388
9, round out the Shea family.   Shea was born in Manhattan. He    1.6432600607208703
attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University    1.5127085093302464
in Washington. He played basketball there while working toward    1.5127085093302464
a law degree.   Later, Shea owned and operated the Long Island    1.6065767145351917
Indians, a minor league professional football team. He was the lawyer    1.6065767145351917
for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football    1.5636360329510388
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees    1.5127085093302464
and the local National Leaguers yesterday. On Friday, Roger Maris,    1.5636360329510388
the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player    1.5636360329510388
award, will meet with Roy Hamey, the general manager.    1.5127085093302464
Maris is in line for a big raise.   1.4513752902486308
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at    1.6065767145351917
the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association    1.5636360329510388
tonight. The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre.    1.5636360329510388
Palmer, golf's leading money-winner in 1960, and Snead will be saluted    1.6065767145351917
as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin.    1.67495327387791
Deane Beman, the National Amateur champion, and all the metropolitan    1.5636360329510388
district champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title-holder,    1.4513752902486308
also will receive awards.   The writers' Gold Tee    1.4513752902486308
Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield, N& J&, and    1.6065767145351917
Palm Beach, Fla&, for his sponsorship of charity tournaments. Horton    1.5636360329510388
Smith of Detroit, a former president of the Professional Golfers    1.5636360329510388
Association, will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback    1.5636360329510388
following a recent illness.   The principal speaker will be Senator    1.5636360329510388
Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.    1.1606783668269585
ARNOLD PALMER has been a blazing figure    1.3761581156320553
in golf over the past twelve months. He won the Masters, the United    1.67495327387791
States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money. He was heralded    1.6432600607208703
as "Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated, and last night    1.6065767145351917
was acclaimed in Rochester as the "Professional Athlete of the    1.5636360329510388
Year", a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond- studded    1.6065767145351917
Hickok Belt.   But he also achieved something that endeared    1.5127085093302464
him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot. A couple of weeks ago,    1.7026049541338664
he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole. It made him human. And    1.7026049541338664
it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were    1.6432600607208703
meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving    1.5636360329510388
them to despair. If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could    1.6432600607208703
commit such a scoring sacrilege, there was hope left for all.   It    1.6432600607208703
was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden    1.67495327387791
that motivated Arnold. He merely became victimized by a form    1.5636360329510388
of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all. The world's    1.6065767145351917
best golfer, shooting below par, came to the last hole of the opening    1.67495327387791
round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering    1.6065767145351917
a final crusher. He boomed a 280-yard drive. Then the pixies and the    1.67495327387791
zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance.    1.5636360329510388
On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole, Arnold whipped    1.5636360329510388
into his second shot. The ball went off in a majestic arc, an    1.67495327387791
out-of-bounds slice. He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds.    1.6432600607208703
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side.    1.6432600607208703
"It is possible that I over-corrected", he said ruefully. Each    1.5636360329510388
of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes. So he wound up with a    1.7269387314284994
dozen.   "It was a nice round figure, that 12", he said as    1.6432600607208703
he headed for the clubhouse, not too much perturbed.   From the    1.6065767145351917
standpoint of the army of duffers, however, this was easily the most heartening    1.67495327387791
exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways    1.6065767145351917
during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open. The idol of    1.7026049541338664
the hackers, of course, is Ray Ainsley, who achieved a 19 in the United    1.7026049541338664
States Open. Their secondary hero is another pro, Willie Chisholm,    1.5636360329510388
who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his    1.6432600607208703
way out of a rock-strewn gully. Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes,    1.6432600607208703
who tried to keep count.    1.1606783668269585
"How many    1.0
is that, Jim"? asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project.   1.6432600607208703
"Thirteen", said Long Jim.   "Nae, man",    1.2818970554302986
said Willie, "ye must be countin' the echoes". He had a 16.   1.6432600607208703
Palmer's dozen were honestly earned. Nor were there any rules    1.5636360329510388
to save him. If there had been, he would have found a loophole, because    1.7026049541338664
Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man    1.67495327387791
who wrote the book. This knowledge has come in handy, too.   His    1.6432600607208703
first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along    1.7026049541338664
the right side of the fairway. The ball floated downstream. A spectator    1.6432600607208703
picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped this    1.7026049541338664
suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.   Arnold sent for    1.6065767145351917
Joe Dey, the executive secretary of the golf association. Joe naturally    1.6065767145351917
ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had    1.67495327387791
originally entered the stream.   "I knew it all along", confessed    1.5636360329510388
Arnold with a grin, "but I just happened to think how much    1.6432600607208703
nicer it would be to drop one way up there".   For a serious young    1.7026049541338664
man who plays golf with a serious intensity, Palmer has such an    1.6432600607208703
inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves    1.67495327387791
from jangling like banjo strings. Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.    1.6432600607208703
He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure    1.6065767145351917
he's right. That's how he first won the Masters in 1958.    1.6065767145351917
It happened on the twelfth hole, a 155-yarder. Arnold's iron shot    1.6065767145351917
from    1.0
the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green, an embankment    1.6065767145351917
that had become soft and spongy from the rains, thereby bringing local    1.6432600607208703
rules into force.    1.0
"I can remove the ball,    1.1606783668269585
can't I"? asked Palmer of an official.   "No", said    1.5127085093302464
the official. "You must play it where it lies".   "You're    1.5636360329510388
wrong", said Arnold, a man who knows the rules. "I'll do    1.6065767145351917
as you say, but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a    1.67495327387791
ruling".   1.0
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball, a 3 with the provisional    1.67495327387791
one. The golfing fathers ruled in his favor. So he picked up a stroke    1.7026049541338664
with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of    1.6432600607208703
that stroke.   Until a few weeks ago, however, Arnold Palmer    1.5636360329510388
was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.    1.6432600607208703
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys, a bigger    1.7269387314284994
hero than he ever had been before.   1.3761581156320553
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings    1.5636360329510388
and    1.0
the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will    1.6065767145351917
be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the    1.6432600607208703
Hotel Warwick today.   Other items on the agenda during the    1.5636360329510388
meetings, which are expected to continue through Saturday, concern television,    1.5636360329510388
rules changes, professional football's hall of fame, players'    1.4513752902486308
benefits and constitutional amendments.   The owners would    1.3761581156320553
like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series    1.6432600607208703
with teams in its division, plus two games against teams in the other    1.67495327387791
division. However, this would require a lengthening of the season    1.5636360329510388
from thirteen to fourteen weeks.   Pete Rozelle, the league commissioner,    1.5636360329510388
pointed out:   "We'll have the problem of baseball    1.4513752902486308
at one end and weather at the other".   Nine of the league's    1.6432600607208703
teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season    1.5636360329510388
conflict in dates.   1.0
If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies,    1.5636360329510388
they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season.   1.6065767145351917
"Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat", Mauch said here    1.5636360329510388
the other day. "The Pirates showed they could outclass the field    1.6065767145351917
last year. They have the same men, no age problem, no injuries and    1.67495327387791
they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season, along with    1.6432600607208703
Bobby Shantz".   Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals, who    1.5127085093302464
gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960, breaking even    1.67495327387791
with them, will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions.    1.6432600607208703
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are    1.6432600607208703
7-9.    1.0
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his    1.3761581156320553
starting pitcher, from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio, for several    1.5636360329510388
reasons: 1. Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark    1.5636360329510388
against Pittsburgh a year ago; 2. The desire to give Broglio as    1.6432600607208703
many starts as possible; 3. The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse    1.5636360329510388
against the Phillies Sunday.   Manager Hemus, eager to    1.4513752902486308
end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games    1.67495327387791
on the current home stand, moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting    1.6432600607208703
assignment. After Thursday's open date, Solly plans to open with    1.5636360329510388
Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night.   Harvey    1.5127085093302464
Haddix, set back by the flu this season, will start against his former    1.67495327387791
Cardinal mates, who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer    1.5636360329510388
in tonight's game at Busch Stadium. Boyer is suffering from a stiff    1.6432600607208703
neck.   Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds, despite    1.5636360329510388
only a 1-3 mark in 1960.   Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh    1.5636360329510388
said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's    1.6065767145351917
game. Mizell has won both of his starts.    1.4513752902486308
After a lengthy workout yesterday, an open date, Hemus said that    1.6065767145351917
Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup. That means Stan    1.6065767145351917
Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his    1.6432600607208703
record five-home run day against the Giants.   "I have to stay    1.6065767145351917
with Nieman for a while", Hemus said. "Bill White (sore ankles)    1.6065767145351917
should be ready. With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh, I may    1.6065767145351917
use Don Taussig in center".   "Lindy McDaniel threw batting    1.5127085093302464
practice about 25 minutes, and he looked good", Hemus said. "He    1.6065767145351917
should be getting back in the groove before long. Our pitching    1.6065767145351917
is much better than it has shown".   The statistics hardly indicated    1.6065767145351917
that the Pirates needed extra batting practice, but Murtaugh    1.5127085093302464
also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday.    1.5127085093302464
Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati    1.5636360329510388
over the weekend, the champions had eight men hitting over .300. Despite    1.6432600607208703
the recession, Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list    1.5636360329510388
of averages: Smoky Burgess .455, Gino Cimoli .389, Bill Virdon    1.5636360329510388
.340, Bob Clemente and Dick Groat, each .323, Dick Stuart .306,    1.6065767145351917
Don Hoak .280 and Bob Skinner .267.   Bill Mazeroski with    1.5636360329510388
.179 and Hal Smith with .143 were the only Pirates dragging their    1.6432600607208703
feet.   Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the    1.6065767145351917
news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend,    1.7026049541338664
who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home    1.6432600607208703
runs. Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely    1.7269387314284994
to see action here this week.   "We're getting Friend    1.5127085093302464
some runs for a change, and he has been pitching good", Murtaugh said.    1.67495327387791
"Virdon has been blasting the ball. No plunkers for him".    1.5636360329510388
The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May    1.5636360329510388
1 last year, when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them    1.67495327387791
even over the season. On last May 1, the Cardinals stood at 7-6, ending    1.7026049541338664
a two-season fall-off on that milestone. In 1958, the Birds were    1.6065767145351917
3-10 on May 1. A year later they were 4-13.   Since 1949, the    1.67495327387791
St& Louis club has been below .500 on May 1 just four times. The    1.7026049541338664
'49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning, then fell as low as 12-17    1.7269387314284994
on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories.   The '52 Cards    1.6065767145351917
were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs, the club's top    1.67495327387791
since    1.0
1949. Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May    1.67495327387791
19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories.   1.67495327387791
Since 1949, the only National League club that got off to a hot    1.67495327387791
start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team. Those    1.7026049541338664
Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game    1.7026049541338664
lead by May 8. The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable    1.7026049541338664
period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants, who    1.6065767145351917
dropped 11 of their first 13.   1.2818970554302986
They honored the battling Billikens last night. Speakers at    1.5127085093302464
a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St& Louis    1.67495327387791
University players who, in the words of Coach John Benington, "had    1.6065767145351917
more confidence in themselves than I did".   The most valuable    1.5636360329510388
player award was split three ways, among Glen Mankowski, Gordon    1.5636360329510388
Hartweger and Tom Kieffer. In addition, a special award was given    1.6065767145351917
to Bob (Bevo) Nordmann, the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of    1.6065767145351917
the season because of a knee injury.   "You often hear people    1.6065767145351917
talk about team spirit and that sort of thing", Benington said in a    1.67495327387791
conversation after the ceremonies, "but what this team had was a little    1.6432600607208703
different. The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's    1.5636360329510388
ability. They knew what they could do and it was often a little more    1.7026049541338664
than I thought they could do.   1.2818970554302986
"Several times I found the players    1.2818970554302986
pepping me up, where it usually is the coach who is supposed to    1.67495327387791
deliver the fight talk. We'd be losing at halftime to a good team    1.67495327387791
and Hartweger would say, 'Don't worry, Coach- we'll get 'em    1.5636360329510388
all right'".   The trio who shared the most-valuable honors    1.5127085093302464
were introduced by Bob Broeg, sports editor of the Post-Dispatch.   1.5636360329510388
Kieffer, the only junior in the group, was commended for his    1.6065767145351917
ability to hit in the clutch, as well as his all-round excellent play.   1.67495327387791
Mankowski, the ball-hawking defensive expert, was cited for    1.4513752902486308
his performance against Bradley in St& Louis U&'s nationally    1.5127085093302464
televised victory. Benington said, "I've never seen a player    1.5127085093302464
have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day".   1.6432600607208703
Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted    1.5636360329510388
Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking    1.67495327387791
in all of the accepted basketball skills. After the coach listed all    1.6432600607208703
the boy's faults, Hartweger said, "Coach before I leave here,    1.5636360329510388
you'll get to like me".   Mrs& Benington admired Gordon's    1.5127085093302464
spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy    1.67495327387791
might help the team.   As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl,    1.5636360329510388
he said, "I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting    1.67495327387791
me play".   Bob Burnes, sports editor of the Globe-Democrat,    1.5127085093302464
presented Bob Nordmann with his award. Bevo was congratulated for    1.5636360329510388
his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his    1.7269387314284994
knee healed in time. Within a week after the injury, suffered in St&    1.67495327387791
Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament, Nordmann    1.6065767145351917
was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help    1.6432600607208703
Benington.   On the clock given him was the inscription, "For    1.5636360329510388
Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball, 1960-61".   1.2818970554302986
Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished    1.6432600607208703
as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were:    1.4513752902486308
Art Hambric, Donnell Reid, Bill Nordmann, Dave Harris, Dave Luechtefeld    1.5636360329510388
and George Latinovich.   "This team set a precedent    1.4513752902486308
that could be valuable in the future", Benington pointed out. "By    1.6065767145351917
winning against Bradley, Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams'    1.5636360329510388
home courts, they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome    1.6432600607208703
anywhere and that it doesn's take a super team to do it".   1.6432600607208703
St& Louis University found a way to win a baseball game. Larry    1.6432600607208703
Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game, said to be the first    1.6432600607208703
in Billiken baseball history, as the Blue and White beat Southeast    1.6065767145351917
Missouri State College, 5-1, at Crystal City.   The victory    1.5127085093302464
was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and    1.67495327387791
a tie. The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday.    1.5636360329510388
Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including    1.7269387314284994
a double, Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave    1.6432600607208703
Ritchie had a home run and a triple.   St& Louis U&    1.6065767145351917
was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington    1.7269387314284994
University at Ligget Field.   The game opened a busy    1.5127085093302464
week for Washington. The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers    1.6432600607208703
College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy, Ill&,    1.6065767145351917
Saturday.    1.0
If it's true that contented cows give more milk,    1.5127085093302464
why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits?    1.5127085093302464
The two top talents of the time, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays,    1.6432600607208703
have    1.0
hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season    1.6432600607208703
than at any period in careers which, to be frank about it, never have    1.7026049541338664
quite reached expectations.   And that's meant as a boost, not    1.5636360329510388
a knock.   Mays and Mantle, both 10-year men at 30, have so    1.6432600607208703
much ability that, baseball men agree, they've never hit the heights.    1.6065767145351917
Their heights, that is.   Mantle, the bull-necked blond switch-hitter,    1.5127085093302464
had one sensational triple-crown season, 1959, when he batted    1.5127085093302464
.365 and also led the American League in home runs, 52, and ~RBIs,    1.67495327387791
130.   Like the Yankees' slugger, Mays, the terror of    1.5127085093302464
the Giants, has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by    1.6432600607208703
most players, but not by- or for- Willie. His best years were 1954    1.67495327387791
when he hit .345 with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs,    1.7269387314284994
drove in 127 and stole 24 bases.   Now, apparently happier    1.5636360329510388
under new managers, Mays and Mantle, the perfect players, are behaving    1.6065767145351917
as though they're going to pass those previous peaks.    1.5127085093302464
Yes, we know, they're professionals, men paid to play, and    1.5636360329510388
they shouldn't care how they're handled, just as long as their    1.6065767145351917
names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month.   1.6432600607208703
The truth is, though, that men react differently to different    1.5636360329510388
treatment. For that matter, Stan Musial is rare, possessing the disposition    1.6065767145351917
that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers, reserving    1.6432600607208703
his opinions, but not    1.0
his effort.   Mantle, it's apparent,    1.1606783668269585
resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the    1.6065767145351917
perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility. The old    1.6065767145351917
man was almost too possessive. Stengel inherited DiMaggio, Rizzuto,    1.5127085093302464
but HE brought up Mantle from Class ~C to the majors, from    1.6432600607208703
Joplin to New York.   With the speed and power of the body    1.6432600607208703
beautiful he saw before him, Ol' Case wanted No& 7 to be not    1.67495327387791
only the best homerun hitter, but also the best bunter, base-runner and    1.6432600607208703
outfielder. Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when    1.6065767145351917
the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats.   Inheriting    1.67495327387791
a more mature Mantle, who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway,    1.7026049541338664
Ralph Houk quietly bestowed, no pun intended, the mantle of    1.5636360329510388
authority on Mickey. The Major decided that, rather than be led,    1.6065767145351917
the slugger could lead. And what leadership a proud Mantle has given    1.6432600607208703
so far.   The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule,    1.6065767145351917
pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting    1.6065767145351917
target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr&, Mantle just might    1.5636360329510388
break the most glamorous record on the books, Babe Ruth's 60 homers    1.6432600607208703
of 1927.    1.0
Mays' day came a day earlier for    1.3761581156320553
Willie than for the kids and Commies this year. Willie's wonderful    1.6065767145351917
walloping Sunday- four home runs- served merely to emphasize how    1.5636360329510388
happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark.   Next to Leo Durocher,    1.67495327387791
Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed    1.6432600607208703
up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month, to help the Giants    1.7026049541338664
win a dramatic pennant.   1.0

cocktail party Tuesday, May 2, from 6 to 8 p&m& in their home. The    1.7026049541338664
Bassis are leaving soon for their new post.   There will be    1.6065767145351917
a stag dinner Friday evening at the Denver Country Club which will    1.6432600607208703
precede the opening of the 1961 golf season.   Cocktails will    1.5636360329510388
be served from 6 to 7 p&m&, with dinner at 7 and entertainment in    1.7026049541338664
the main dining room immediately following.   {Miss Betsy Parker}    1.5127085093302464
was one of the speakers on the panel of the Eastern Women's    1.6432600607208703
Liberal Arts College panel on Wednesday evening in the Security    1.5636360329510388

The committee for the annual Central City fashion    1.4513752902486308
show has been announced by {Mrs& D& W& Moore}, chairman.   1.5636360329510388
The event, staged yearly by Neusteters, will be held in    1.5636360329510388
the Opera House Wednesday, Aug& 16. It will be preceded by luncheon    1.6432600607208703

Members of the committee include {Mrs& Milton Bernet,    1.4513752902486308

Andrew S& Kelsey} of Washington, D&C&, announce the birth    1.5127085093302464
of a daughter, {Kira Ann Kelsey}, on Monday in Washington,    1.5636360329510388
D&C&.   Grandparents are {Mr& and Mrs& R&L&    1.3761581156320553

Scarsdale, N&Y&.   Mrs& Kelsey is the former {Miss    1.4513752902486308
Ann Rickenbaugh}.   1.0
A cheery smile, a compassionate interest in others and a practical    1.6065767145351917
down-to-earth approach.   Those qualities make {Esther Marr}    1.3761581156320553
a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social    1.4513752902486308
Center at 1200 Larimer st&.   The pert, gray-haired woman    1.5127085093302464
who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo, N&Y&, is    1.6065767145351917
a "civilian" with the Army.   Her position covers a number    1.5636360329510388
of daily tasks common to any social director. The job also covers a    1.67495327387791
number of other items.   "Mom" Marr, as the more than 80 men    1.6432600607208703
at the center call her,    1.1606783668269585
is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between    1.5636360329510388
alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.   1.5636360329510388
Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing letters    1.6065767145351917
there are to be written (and during May, which is National Salvation    1.6432600607208703
Army Week, there are plenty), schedules to be made or problems    1.6065767145351917
to be solved, Mrs& Marr's office is always open and the welcome    1.6432600607208703
mat is out.   {MRS& MARR} is the first contact a Skid    1.6065767145351917
Row    1.0
figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.   1.6432600607208703
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and    1.7026049541338664
the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and    1.67495327387791
explains procedures.   "Usually at this point a man is withdrawn    1.5636360329510388
from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle    1.7269387314284994
with his fellow men", Mrs& Marr explained.   The Denverite    1.5127085093302464
has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities    1.6432600607208703
of the center.   "And I bum tickets to everything I can",    1.6065767145351917
she said. "I've become the greatest beggar in the world".   1.5636360329510388
{IN ADDITION}    1.0
to the tickets to the movies, sporting events    1.4513752902486308
and concerts, Mrs& Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics    1.6065767145351917
require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system.   1.6432600607208703
Mrs& Marr also has a number of parolees to "mother", watching    1.6065767145351917
to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn    1.7026049541338664
to readjust to society.   1.0
By mid-June, millions of Americans will take to the road on    1.6065767145351917
vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely    1.7026049541338664
land.   In another four weeks, with schools closed across the    1.5636360329510388
nation, the great all-American summer safari will be under way. By    1.6065767145351917
July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers all over the nation will,    1.6432600607208703
by 6 p&m&, be switching on that bleak- to motorists- sign, "No    1.6432600607208703
Vacancy".   No matter how many Americans go abroad in    1.5127085093302464
summer, probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car, throw    1.67495327387791
suitcases, kids and comic books in the back seat, and head for home. And    1.7026049541338664
where is "home", that magic place of the heart?   Ah,    1.5636360329510388
that is simple. Home is where a man was born, reared, went to school    1.7026049541338664
and, most particularly, where grandma is. That is where we turn in the    1.67495327387791
good old summertime.   The land lies ready for the coming onslaught.    1.6065767145351917
My husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just finished    1.67495327387791
a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson, Ariz&, to New    1.6432600607208703
York City:    1.0
I can testify that motels, service    1.2818970554302986
and comfort stations (they go together like Scots and heather), dog    1.6065767145351917
wagons, roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms are braced    1.5636360329510388
and waiting.   I hope it can be said without boasting that    1.6065767145351917
no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty    1.6065767145351917
of scene, such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and    1.7026049541338664
such decent, far-flung over-night accommodations.   Maybe motel-keeping    1.3761581156320553
isn't the nation's biggest industry, but it certainly looks    1.5127085093302464
that way from the highway.   There are motels for all purposes    1.6065767145351917
and all tastes. There are even motels for local weather peculiarities,    1.6065767145351917
as I discovered in Shamrock, Tex&. There the Royal Motel    1.5636360329510388
advertises "all facilities, vented heat, air conditioned, carpeted,    1.4513752902486308
free ~TV, storm cellar".    1.0
Innumerable motels    1.0
from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ("swim at your    1.6065767145351917
own risk" is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools).    1.67495327387791
Some even boast two pools, one for adults and one for children. But    1.67495327387791
the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort    1.67495327387791
and security of a storm cellar.   Motorists like myself who    1.5636360329510388
can remember the old "tourists accommodated" signs on farm houses    1.5636360329510388
and village homes before World War /2, can only marvel at the great    1.67495327387791
size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business.    1.6432600607208703
At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester,    1.2818970554302986
Va&, we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with    1.6065767145351917
wall-to-wall carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade    1.5127085093302464
chairs, 24-inch ~TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels.    1.67495327387791
All for $14.   That made up for the "best" motel in Norman,    1.6432600607208703
Okla&, where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when    1.6065767145351917
we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.   1.3761581156320553
Oxnard, Calif&, will be the home of the Rev& Robert D&    1.6065767145351917
Howard and his bride, the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay, who were    1.6432600607208703
married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church.    1.4513752902486308

the bride was given in marriage by her father. Honor attendants for    1.6432600607208703
the couple were Miss Sandra Branum and Warren V& McRoberts.   1.5636360329510388
The couple will honeymoon in Sequoia National Park, Calif&.   1.5127085093302464
Miss Joan Frances Baker, a graduate of ~SMU, was married    1.5636360329510388
Saturday to Elvis Leonard Mason, an honor graduate of Lamar State    1.6065767145351917

Church of Houston.   The bride, daughter of Rhodes Semmes    1.5127085093302464
Baker Jr& of Houston and the late Mrs& Baker, was president of    1.6432600607208703
Kappa Kappa Gamma and a member of Mortar Board at ~SMU. Her    1.6432600607208703
husband, who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport, La&,    1.6432600607208703
and the late Mrs& Henry Cater Parmer, was president of Alpha    1.6065767145351917

graduate work at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa,    1.5127085093302464
on a Rotary Fellowship.   The Rev& Richard Freeman of    1.5127085093302464
Texas City officiated and Charles Pabor and Mrs& Marvin Hand    1.5636360329510388
presented music. The bride was given in marriage by her father.   1.6065767145351917
She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed with bateau neckline    1.6065767145351917
and princesse skirt accented by lace appliques. Her veil was caught    1.6065767145351917
to a crown, and she carried gardenias and stephanotis.   Miss    1.5636360329510388
Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor, and bridesmaids were Miss Pat    1.67495327387791
Dawson of Austin, Mrs& Howard M& Dean of Hinsdale, Ill&,    1.5636360329510388
and Mrs& James A& Reeder of Shreveport, La&.   Cecil    1.5127085093302464
Mason of Hartford, Conn&, was best man for his brother, and    1.6065767145351917
groomsmen were Rhodes S& Baker /3, of Houston, Dr& James    1.5636360329510388
Carter of Houston and Conrad McEachern of New Orleans, La&.    1.5636360329510388
Lee Jackson and Ken Smith, both of Houston, and Alfred Neumann    1.6065767145351917
of Beaumont seated guests.   After a reception at The Mayfair,    1.5636360329510388
the newlyweds left for a wedding trip to New Orleans, La&. They    1.6432600607208703
will live in Corpus Christi.   1.1606783668269585

State University, was married Saturday to Larry W& Mills, who    1.5636360329510388
has attended Arlington State College. They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh    1.6065767145351917

couple are Ray Meredith of Denton and the late Mrs& Meredith    1.6065767145351917
and Mrs& Hardy P& Mills of Floresville and the late Mr& Mills.   1.6432600607208703
The Rev& Melvin Carter officiated at the ceremony    1.4513752902486308
in Slaughter Chapel of the First Baptist Church. Dan Beam presented    1.6065767145351917

a flared skirt and lace jacket with bateau neckline. Her veil was    1.6432600607208703
caught to a pearl headdress, and she carried stephanotis and orchids.   1.6065767145351917
Miss Glenda Kay Meredith of Denton was her sister's maid    1.5636360329510388
or honor, and Vernon Lewelleyn of San Angelo was best man. Robert    1.6432600607208703
Lovelace and Cedric Burgher Jr& seated guests. A reception was    1.5636360329510388

"A Night in New Orleans" is the gayety planned by members    1.6065767145351917
of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club.    1.6432600607208703
The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different    1.6065767145351917
and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition.    1.67495327387791
Mrs& H& J& Grinsfelder is chairman.   The Louisiana    1.4513752902486308
city is known, of course, for its fine food, good music and its colorful    1.7026049541338664
hospitality "and,    1.0
when guests arrive at Philmont that night",    1.3761581156320553
says Mrs& Grinsfelder, "that is exactly what we expect to offer    1.6065767145351917
them. We've been working for weeks. The prospects look great.    1.5636360329510388
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats. But we can't    1.67495327387791
tell it all now and then have no new excitement later".    1.6065767145351917
But she does indicate festivities will start early, that    1.5127085093302464
a jazz combo will "give with the Basin Street beat" during the    1.6432600607208703
cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take    1.6065767145351917
over during the dancing.   As for food, Mrs& Henry Louchheim,    1.5636360329510388
chairman of this phase,    1.0
is a globetrotter who knows good food. "New    1.4513752902486308
Orleans"? she says, "of course I've had the best. It    1.5636360329510388
is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no ~R's,    1.748515906000203
so no oysters. But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties.    1.6432600607208703
I know they will be good. We've tried them out on the club chef-    1.7026049541338664
or say, he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best".    1.7269387314284994
Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic    1.4513752902486308
effects. There will be masses of flowers, reproductions of the    1.5636360329510388
handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are    1.6065767145351917
typical of New Orleans. Mrs& Harry K& Cohen is chairman of this    1.6432600607208703
phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A& Van Hollander,    1.6432600607208703
display director of Gimbel Brothers.   The gala is the Thrift    1.5636360329510388
Shop's annual bundle party and, as all Thrift Shop friends    1.5636360329510388
know, that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition,    1.7026049541338664
contributions of household equipment, bric-a-brac and such to    1.4513752902486308
stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters at 1213 Walnut St&.    1.6065767145351917
For the convenience of guests bundle centers    1.3761581156320553
have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations    1.6065767145351917
may be deposited between now and the date of the big event. In addition    1.7026049541338664
to the bundles, guests pay the cost of their dinners. Members    1.6065767145351917
of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing    1.748515906000203
time are welcomed.   The Thrift Shop, with Mrs& Bernhard    1.5127085093302464
S& Blumenthal as president, is one of the city's most successful    1.6065767145351917
fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies. Some idea    1.5127085093302464
of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made    1.6432600607208703
by them during the past 25 years that totals $840,000.    1.5636360329510388
"Big business, this little Thrift Shop business",    1.3761581156320553

festivities, presented at the Muncipal Auditorium and chosen as her    1.5636360329510388
ladies in waiting were Misses Clayton Nairne, Eleanor Eustis, Lynn    1.5636360329510388
Chapman, Irwin Leatherman of Robinsonville, Miss& and Helene    1.4513752902486308
Rowley. The large municipal hall was ablaze with color, which shown    1.6065767145351917
out from the bright array of chic ballgowns worn by those participating    1.6432600607208703
in the "maskers' dances".   The mother of young queen,    1.5127085093302464
Mrs& G& Henry Pierson Jr& chose a white brocade gown made    1.6065767145351917
on slim lines with panels of tomato-red and bright green satin extending    1.6432600607208703
down the back. Mrs& Thomas Jordan selected a black taffeta frock    1.6065767145351917
made with a skirt of fringed tiers and worn with crimson silk slippers.    1.67495327387791
Mrs& Clayton Nairne, whose daughter, was among the court maids,    1.5636360329510388
chose a deep greenish blue lace gown. Mrs& Fenwick Eustis, whose    1.6065767145351917
daughter was also a maid to the queen, wore an ashes of roses slipper    1.7026049541338664
satin gown. Mrs& Peter Feringa Jr&, last year's Achaeans'    1.5127085093302464
queen, chose an eggshell white filmy lace short dress made with    1.6065767145351917
a wide decolletage trimmed with an edging of tulle. Mrs& Eustis Reily's    1.6432600607208703
olive-green    1.0
street length silk taffeta dress was embroidered on    1.4513752902486308

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would    1.5127085093302464
reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary    1.67495327387791
cuts and lay-offs effective at 12.01 A&M& next Saturday. The    1.5636360329510388
current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000.   Howard E&    1.5127085093302464
Simpson, the railroad's president, said, "A drastic decline in    1.5127085093302464
freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement    1.6065767145351917
of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action".   The    1.5127085093302464
reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in    1.6065767145351917
which the B& + O& operates.    1.1606783668269585
It    1.0
will be accomplished in two ways: _1._ A flat reduction of 10 per    1.67495327387791
cent in the salary of all officers, supervisors and other employees    1.6065767145351917
not belonging to unions. There are about 3,325 officers and employees    1.6065767145351917
in this class. _2._ Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to    1.5636360329510388
bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.   Since    1.67495327387791
the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members    1.5636360329510388
under contract, it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some    1.6065767145351917
of the men on furlough, a B&+O& spokesman said.   Those    1.5636360329510388
union members kept on their jobs, therefore, will not take a cut in their    1.7026049541338664
wages.   The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot    1.5636360329510388
be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending    1.67495327387791
on what men are most needed on the job.   1.5127085093302464
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night    1.7026049541338664
after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount streets.   The    1.6065767145351917
victim, Norman B& Wiley, 38, of the 900 block North Charles street,    1.6432600607208703
was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery.   1.6065767145351917
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got    1.6065767145351917
out of the cab with his money. The victim was beaten when he attempted    1.7026049541338664
to stop the bandit.   He said the assailant, who was armed    1.6065767145351917
with a .45-caliber automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue    1.5636360329510388
and Gold street.   In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41,    1.5127085093302464
proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street, told police    1.67495327387791
two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash    1.67495327387791
register after choking and beating him.   1.2818970554302986
A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously    1.6432600607208703
injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel    1.6432600607208703
county home.   The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1,    1.4513752902486308
was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital    1.5636360329510388
in Annapolis.   His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and    1.5636360329510388
John Raymond, Jr& 22 months, were admitted to the hospital. The    1.6065767145351917
girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body.    1.7026049541338664
The boy received second-degree burns of    1.2818970554302986
the face, neck and back. His condition was reported to be fair.   1.6432600607208703
Police said the children's mother, Mrs& Eleanor Somerville,    1.4513752902486308
was visiting next door when the fire occurred.   The house is    1.6065767145351917
on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park, at Jones Station,    1.67495327387791
police said.    1.0
_ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent    1.5127085093302464
has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice    1.6065767145351917
of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more    1.6432600607208703
question about who said what.   The proposal was made by Dr&    1.6065767145351917
David S& Jenkins after he and Mrs& D& Ellwood Williams,    1.5636360329510388
Jr&,    1.0
a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent, argued    1.5636360329510388
for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.   The disagreement    1.5636360329510388
was over what Dr& Jenkins had said at a previous session    1.6065767145351917
and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following    1.6432600607208703
meeting.    1.0
Mrs& Williams had a list which    1.2818970554302986
she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory    1.6065767145351917
of Dr& Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for    1.6065767145351917
the board's approval.   "I hate to have these things come    1.5636360329510388
up again and again", Dr& Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion.    1.6432600607208703
"These are the board's minutes. I'll write what you tell    1.5636360329510388
me to".   For a number of years the board used a machine to    1.67495327387791
keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.   1.6432600607208703
It was about that time, a board member said later, that Dr&    1.6432600607208703
Thomas G& Pullen, Jr&,    1.0
State superintendent of schools, told    1.1606783668269585
Dr& Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would    1.6432600607208703
not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him.   1.67495327387791
The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary Commission,    1.4513752902486308
the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies    1.5636360329510388
use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law    1.6432600607208703
suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their    1.5636360329510388
meetings.   Dr& Jenkins notes, however, that most of the    1.5127085093302464
school boards in the State do not do so.   1.5127085093302464
State Senator Joseph A& Bertorelli (D&, First Baltimore)    1.4513752902486308
had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block    1.6432600607208703
of West Pratt street.   He was taken to University Hospital    1.5636360329510388
in a municipal ambulance.   Doctors at the hospital said he was    1.6065767145351917
partially paralyzed on the right side. His condition was said to be,    1.6432600607208703
"fair".   Police said he became ill while parked in front of    1.6065767145351917
a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street.    1.4513752902486308
He called    1.0

The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday    1.5127085093302464
that there are "deficiencies" in the city's snow clearing program    1.5636360329510388
which should be corrected as soon as possible.   Councilman William    1.5636360329510388
D& Schaefer (D&, Fifth) said in a letter to Mayor Grady    1.6065767145351917
that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms    1.6065767145351917
and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month.    1.67495327387791
Conceding that several cities to the north were    1.4513752902486308
in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr& Schaefer    1.6065767145351917
listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here.   1.67495327387791
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December.    1.67495327387791
Equipment should be in operation "almost immediately after the    1.5127085093302464
first snowfall", Mr& Schaefer said.   The Councilman,    1.3761581156320553
who is the Administration floor leader, also criticized Bernard L&    1.5636360329510388
Werner, public works director, for "halting snow operations" on    1.5127085093302464
Tuesday night after the Sunday storm.    1.2818970554302986
Mr&    1.0
Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week.    1.5127085093302464
What he did, Mr& Werner said, was let manual laborers go home Tuesday    1.67495327387791
night for some rest. Work resumed Wednesday, he said.    1.5127085093302464
Mr& Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan,    1.5636360329510388
under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to    1.67495327387791
use snow tires or chains on them, should be "strictly enforced".   1.6065767145351917
Admitting that main streets and the central business district    1.5127085093302464
should have priority, the Councilman said it is also essential that    1.6065767145351917
small shopping areas "not be overlooked **h if our small merchants are    1.6432600607208703
to survive".   Recounting personal observations of clearance    1.3761581156320553
work, the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment    1.5636360329510388
or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be    1.6432600607208703
set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually    1.7026049541338664
freezes.    1.0
_ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7 (SPECIAL)_- The 15-year-old adopted son of    1.5127085093302464
a Washington attorney and his wife, who were murdered early today in    1.6432600607208703
their Chesapeake Bay-front home, has been sent to Spring Grove State    1.6065767145351917
Hospital for detention.   The victims were H& Malone Dresbach,    1.5127085093302464
47, and his wife, Shirley, 46. Each had been shot in the back    1.67495327387791
several times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle, according to Capt&    1.5636360329510388
Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.   Judge    1.4513752902486308
Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital    1.6065767145351917
because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel    1.6065767145351917
County Jail. The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have    1.6065767145351917
a hearing in Juvenile Court.      1.1606783668269585
Soon after 10 A&M&, when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick    1.5636360329510388
home    1.0
in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles south of here on the bay, in    1.7026049541338664
response to a call from the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they    1.6432600607208703
found Mrs& Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor. Her    1.5636360329510388
husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.   The younger    1.6065767145351917
son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings    1.67495327387791
and had driven away in their mother's car.   The description    1.5636360329510388
of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland    1.5127085093302464
on police radio.    1.0
Police said the boys    1.0
are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.   1.6432600607208703
Trooper J& A& Grzesiak spotted the wanted car,    1.4513752902486308
with    1.0
three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside Annapolis. The    1.6432600607208703

_ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L&    1.5127085093302464
Simpkins, his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary    1.3761581156320553
of State.   Mr& Simpkins will move into the post being vacated    1.6065767145351917
by Thomas B& Finan, earlier named attorney general to succeed    1.5636360329510388
C& Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated to an associate judgeship    1.6065767145351917
on the Maryland Court of Appeals.   Governor Tawes announced    1.5127085093302464
that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office    1.6065767145351917
next Friday.    1.0
Mr& Simpkins is a resident    1.1606783668269585
of Somerset county, and he and the Governor, also a Somerset countian,    1.6432600607208703
have been friends since Mr& Simpkins was a child.   Now    1.5636360329510388
38, Mr& Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's    1.5636360329510388
College of Agriculture in 1947.   Five years later, he    1.5127085093302464
was awarded the university's degree in law.   Mr& Simpkins    1.5127085093302464
made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from    1.7026049541338664
1951 through 1958. From the outset of his first term, he established    1.6432600607208703
himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.   1.6432600607208703
MARYLAND contracts for future construction during October    1.3761581156320553
totaled $77,389,000, up to 10 per cent compared to October, 1960, F&    1.6432600607208703
W& Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.   Dodge reported    1.3761581156320553
the following breakdown:   Nonresidential at $20,447,000, down    1.3761581156320553
28 per cent; residential at $47,101,000, up 100 per cent; and    1.6065767145351917
heavy engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.   The cumulative    1.5636360329510388
total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted    1.6432600607208703
to $634,517,000, a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding    1.6065767145351917
period of last year.   A breakdown of the ten-month total    1.5636360329510388
showed:   Nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent; residential    1.5127085093302464
at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent; and heavy engineering at    1.5636360329510388

The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments, which    1.6065767145351917
began about six years ago, has more than tripled within that span of    1.67495327387791
time.   In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings    1.5636360329510388
will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction.   1.67495327387791
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor    1.5127085093302464
in encouraging apartment construction, the generally high level of    1.5127085093302464
prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among    1.6432600607208703
the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the    1.5636360329510388
apartment-building    1.0
field.   Although economic and personal circumstances    1.2818970554302986
vary widely among those now choosing apartments, Leo J& Pantas,    1.5636360329510388
vice president of a hardware manufacturing company, pointed out recently    1.5636360329510388
that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common:    1.6065767145351917
a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems    1.5636360329510388
involved in maintaining a house.    1.1606783668269585
"Convenience    1.0
is therefore the key to the housing market today. Trouble-free,    1.5636360329510388
long-life, quality components will play an increasingly important    1.4513752902486308
part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960", Pantas    1.5636360329510388
predicted.   1.0
SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the 165-unit    1.5127085093302464
Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section.   Ultimately    1.5127085093302464
the development will comprise 300 units, in two-story and three-story    1.5636360329510388
structures. Various of the apartments are of the terrace type, being    1.6065767145351917
on the ground floor so that entrance is direct. Others, which are    1.6432600607208703
reached by walking up a single flight of stairs, have balconies.   1.6065767145351917
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction.    1.6065767145351917
Heating is by individual gas-fired, forced warm air systems.   1.5127085093302464

_LONDON, FEB& 9_- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic    1.5127085093302464
submarine, the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire United    1.5636360329510388
States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet, were stolen by a    1.5636360329510388
London-based soviet spy ring, secret service agents testified today.   1.5127085093302464
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United    1.5636360329510388
States in 1959 and was launched last year. It is a killer sub- that    1.7026049541338664
is, a hunter of enemy subs. It has a hull patterned on that of the    1.7269387314284994
United States navy's Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine.    1.5127085093302464
Its power unit, however, was derived from the reactor of the more    1.6432600607208703
modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack.    1.1606783668269585
The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen    1.6065767145351917
was made in Bow st& police court here at the end of a three day    1.7269387314284994
hearing. A full trial was ordered for:   Two British civil    1.5636360329510388
servants, Miss Ethel Gee, 46, and her newly devoted friend, Harry    1.6065767145351917
Houghton, 55, and divorced. They are accused of whisking secrets out    1.6065767145351917
of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard.   Gordon A&    1.5636360329510388
Lonsdale, 37, a mystery man presumed to be Russian altho he carries    1.6432600607208703
a Canadian passport. When arrested, he had the submarine secrets    1.5636360329510388
on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in    1.67495327387791

man, usually on the first Saturday evening of each month, and    1.6065767145351917
spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow, either    1.6432600607208703
on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted    1.67495327387791
over period marks in used books. Each dot on magnification resumed    1.6065767145351917
its original condition as a drawing, a printed page, or a manuscript.   1.6432600607208703
All five pleaded innocent. Only Miss Gee asked for bail.    1.5636360329510388
Her young British lawyer, James Dunlop, pleaded that she was sorely    1.6065767145351917
needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother, 80, her maiden    1.6432600607208703
aunt, also 80 and bedridden for 20 years, and her uncle, 76, who once    1.7026049541338664
ran a candy shop.    1.0
"I am not prepared to    1.1606783668269585

The trial will be held, probably the first week of    1.5636360329510388
March, in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus    1.6065767145351917
Fuchs, the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded    1.5127085093302464
in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and    1.6065767145351917
thereby changed world history during the 1950s, was sentenced to 14 years    1.6432600607208703
in prison.   Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced    1.5636360329510388
by the new five, who may have altered history in the 1960s. Fuchs,    1.67495327387791
after nine and a half years, was released, being given time off for good    1.7026049541338664
behavior. He promptly went to communist East Germany.   The    1.5127085093302464
magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American    1.6065767145351917
and British currency, mostly $20 bills, and in British government    1.5636360329510388
bonds and stocks.   "This is Russian money", said Mervin Griffith-Jones    1.5636360329510388
for the attorney general's office. He asserted that    1.4513752902486308
the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow, Lonsdale the Red paymaster,    1.6065767145351917
and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's    1.6065767145351917
The fact that secrets of    1.1606783668269585
the Dreadnought, and thereby of the American undersea fleet, were involved    1.6065767145351917
in the spy case had been hinted at earlier.   But just before    1.6432600607208703
luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's    1.6065767145351917
chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare, Capt& George    1.5636360329510388
Symonds. He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed    1.5636360329510388
details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of    1.6432600607208703
film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants    1.67495327387791
outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon, Jan& 7.   1.5127085093302464
The information, he said, would have been of the highest value to    1.6432600607208703
a potential enemy.    1.0
Just how many sub secrets were    1.2818970554302986
being handed over when the ring, watched for six months, was broken    1.6432600607208703
remained untold.   The British defending lawyers, who today increased    1.5127085093302464
from three to four, demanded to know if they could make the information    1.67495327387791
involved seem of little value to a jury, the chances of their    1.6432600607208703
clients would improve. So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared    1.6432600607208703
the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate    1.6432600607208703
for almost an hour.   Almost any information about the Dreadnought    1.5636360329510388
would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.    1.5127085093302464
Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American    1.67495327387791
government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with    1.6065767145351917
Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed. The United    1.5636360329510388
States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like    1.6065767145351917
that used in the Skipjack.   With the machinery went a complete    1.6065767145351917
design for the hull.   The Skipjack was a second generation    1.5636360329510388
atomic sub, much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded    1.67495327387791
it.    1.0
"Much of the navy's future    1.1606783668269585

Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August, 1959, for exhibition    1.6065767145351917
to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station.    1.5127085093302464
It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work.   1.6432600607208703
"Her basic hull form [a teardrop] and her nuclear power    1.5636360329510388
plant will be used for almost all new submarines, including the potent    1.6432600607208703
Polaris missile submarines", the statement went on.   The atom    1.5127085093302464
reactor, water cooled, was the result of almost a decade of research    1.6432600607208703
at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse    1.6432600607208703
Electric Corp&. Thru development, the reactor and its    1.4513752902486308
steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size, and also in complexity,    1.6432600607208703
allowing a single propeller to be used, the navy said.   The    1.6065767145351917
hull was also a result of almost a decade of work. It was first tried    1.7269387314284994
out on a conventional submarine, the Albacore, in 1954.   The    1.5636360329510388
Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built. Reputedly it could    1.5636360329510388
outrun, underwater, the fastest destroyers. It could, reputedly, go    1.5127085093302464
70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month.    1.6065767145351917
It was of the hunter-killer type, designed to seek out ships and other    1.67495327387791
submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes.   1.6065767145351917
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found    1.6065767145351917
in Miss Gee's purse would, if completed and handed back, have    1.6065767145351917
given the Kremlin a complete picture "of our current anti-submarine    1.5636360329510388
effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development    1.67495327387791
for the future".    1.0
The spy ring also    1.0
was particularly interested in ~ASDIC, the underwater equipment    1.4513752902486308
for detecting submarines, it was testified. Range was a vital detail.    1.6065767145351917
Designs of parts were sought.   Six radiomen told how, twice    1.5636360329510388
on two days after the ring was nabbed, a transmitter near Moscow was    1.67495327387791
heard calling, using signals, times and wavelengths specified on codes    1.5636360329510388
found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the    1.5636360329510388
Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid. Oddly,    1.5636360329510388
the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested.   1.6432600607208703
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics    1.5636360329510388
detail detectives "is the product of rumor, combined with malice,    1.5636360329510388
and individual enmity" on the part of the federal narcotics unit here    1.6432600607208703
was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph    1.5636360329510388
Sam Perry in federal District court.   The three- Miles J&    1.5636360329510388
Cooperman, Sheldon Teller, and Richard Austin- and eight other    1.5127085093302464
defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate    1.5636360329510388
federal narcotic laws.   In his opening statement to a jury    1.5636360329510388
of eight women and four men, Bernard H& Sokol, attorney for the detectives,    1.67495327387791
said that evidence would show that his clients were "entirely    1.5636360329510388
"When they became    1.0
members of the city police narcotics unit", Sokol said, "they were    1.6065767145351917
told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which    1.7026049541338664
narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in    1.67495327387791
the narcotics racket. They, on occasion, posed as addicts and peddlers".   1.6065767145351917
Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked    1.4513752902486308
together, Sokol continued,    1.0
rivalries developed when they were "aiming    1.2818970554302986
at the same criminals". This, he added, brought about "petty jealousies"    1.6065767145351917
and "petty personal grievances".   "In the same    1.3761581156320553
five year period that the United States says they [the detectives]    1.6065767145351917
were engaged in this conspiracy", Sokol continued, "these three    1.5127085093302464
young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special    1.6432600607208703
compensations, and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the    1.6065767145351917
mayor's medal".    1.0
In opening, D&    1.0
Arthur Connelly, assistant United States attorney, read the indictment,    1.5127085093302464
but made no comments. Attorneys for the eight other defendants    1.5636360329510388
said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt.    1.6065767145351917
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin    1.6065767145351917
to a convicted narcotics peddler, Otis Sears, 45, of 6934 Indiana av&.    1.6432600607208703
Among other acts, Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800    1.6065767145351917
to Sears.   The first witness, Moses Winston Mardis, 5835    1.5127085093302464
Michigan av&, a real estate agent and former bail bondsman, took the    1.6432600607208703
stand after opening statements had been made. But court adjourned after    1.6065767145351917
he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings,    1.5636360329510388
two of the defendants, and also introduced Pullings to Jessy    1.5636360329510388
Maroy, a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.   1.5636360329510388
Buaford Robinson, 23, of 7026 Stewart av&, a ~CTA bus    1.5636360329510388
driver, was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st    1.7026049541338664
street and South Park way. Robinson was treated at a physician's    1.6065767145351917
office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.    1.67495327387791
His losses included his money bag, containing $40 to $50 and his $214    1.67495327387791
paycheck.   Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan    1.4513752902486308
Lloyd of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south    1.6432600607208703
bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High school, 30th    1.6065767145351917
street and South Park way, and began "skylarking".   When    1.5127085093302464
51st street was reached, Robinson related, he stopped the bus and told    1.6432600607208703
the youths he was going to call the ~CTA supervisor. As he left    1.67495327387791
the bus with his money bag, Robinson added, the largest youth accosted    1.6432600607208703
him, a quarrel ensued, and the youth knocked him down. Then the    1.6432600607208703
youths fled with his money.   1.1606783668269585
Mrs& Blanche Dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years in the Dwight    1.6432600607208703
reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law, Ervin    1.6432600607208703
Lang, then 28, appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before    1.6432600607208703
two Illinois pardon and parole board members, John M& Bookwalter    1.5636360329510388
and Joseph Carpentier. She had been sentenced to 180 years in    1.6065767145351917
prison, but former Gov& Stratton commuted her term to 75 years, making    1.6432600607208703
her eligible for parole, as one of his last acts in office.   1.6432600607208703
Mrs& Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became    1.6065767145351917
her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934. It was when he    1.7026049541338664
attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place.   1.5636360329510388
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday    1.6065767145351917
and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman    1.6432600607208703
on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan&    1.6432600607208703
20.   The defendant, William L& Stickney /3, 23, of    1.5127085093302464
3211 Park pl&, Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless driving, also    1.6065767145351917
was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic    1.6065767145351917
school each Tuesday night for one month.   Stickney is a salesman    1.6065767145351917
for Plee-Zing, Inc&, 2544 Green Bay rd&, Evanston, a    1.5127085093302464
food brokerage and grocery chain firm, of which his father, William L&    1.6432600607208703
Jr&, is president.   Patrolman James F& Simms said    1.4513752902486308
he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart    1.67495327387791
avenue at Central street.   At Jenks street, Simms said,    1.5127085093302464
the car skidded completely around, just missed two parked cars, and    1.6065767145351917
sped east in Jenks.   The car spun around again, Simms said,    1.6065767145351917
before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue, and then violated    1.6065767145351917
two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie.    1.6065767145351917
_ST& JOHNS, MICH&, APRIL 19._- A jury of seven men and five    1.6432600607208703
women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday    1.5127085093302464
in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs& Anna Hengesbach.   Pohl    1.5127085093302464
received the verdict without visible emotion. He returned to his cell    1.6065767145351917
in the county jail, where he has been held since his arrest last July,    1.7026049541338664
without a word to his court-appointed attorney, Jack Walker, or his    1.6065767145351917
guard.    1.0
The verdict brought vindication to    1.1606783668269585
the dead woman's stepson, Vincent Hengesbach, 54, who was tried    1.5636360329510388
for the same crime in December, 1958, and released when the jury failed    1.67495327387791
to reach a verdict. Mrs& Hengesbach was killed on Aug& 31, 1958.   1.6432600607208703
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since. When    1.5636360329510388
the verdict came in against his young neighbor, Hengesbach said:   1.5636360329510388
"I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed. Still,    1.6432600607208703
I don't wish to appear happy at somebody's else's misfortune".    1.5636360329510388
Hengesbach, who has been living on welfare    1.3761581156320553
recently, said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by    1.6432600607208703
his grandfather in Westphalia, 27 miles southwest of here.   Hengesbach    1.5636360329510388
has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were    1.6432600607208703
burned down after his release in 1958.   Pohl confessed the    1.5636360329510388
arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area    1.6065767145351917
by State Police.   He also admitted killing Mrs& Hengesbach.    1.5127085093302464
However, the confession, which was the only evidence against him,    1.5636360329510388
was retracted before the trial.    1.1606783668269585
Assistant Prosecutor    1.0
Fred Lewis, who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases,    1.5636360329510388
said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending    1.7026049541338664
against Pohl.   Circuit Judge Paul R& Cash did not set    1.5636360329510388
a date for sentencing. Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison    1.7026049541338664
or probation.   Walker said he was considering filing a motion    1.5636360329510388
for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the    1.67495327387791
weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial    1.6432600607208703
procedure.    1.0
A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05    1.3761581156320553
p&m& after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation. The jury, which    1.5636360329510388
was locked up in a motel overnight, was canvassed at the request of    1.67495327387791
Walker after the verdict was announced.   The jury foreman, Mrs&    1.5636360329510388
Olive Heideman, of rural Elsie, said that a ballot was not even    1.6432600607208703
taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation    1.6065767145351917
was spent in going over the evidence.   She said the jurors agreed    1.6432600607208703
that Pohl's confession was valid.   The jury asked Judge    1.5127085093302464
Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first    1.6432600607208703
and second-degree murder and manslaughter.   The verdict came    1.4513752902486308
three hours later.   Some 30 spectators remained in the court during    1.6065767145351917
the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read. The trial had    1.7026049541338664
packed the large courtroom for more than a week.   1.5127085093302464
A Sterling Township family of six surviving children, whose    1.5127085093302464
mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one    1.67495327387791
of the children, found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors    1.67495327387791
and school friends.   While neighbor women assumed some of the    1.5636360329510388
dead mother's duties, fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners    1.6065767145351917
association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski    1.5636360329510388
family, 34220 Viceroy.   Mrs& Eleanor Kowalski, 42,    1.3761581156320553
died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered    1.5636360329510388
in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the    1.67495327387791
flat of her widowed mother, Mrs& Mary Pankowski, in the adjoining    1.6065767145351917
suburb of Warren.    1.0
Funeral services for Mrs&    1.0
Kowalski and her daughter, Christine, 11, who died of burns at    1.6065767145351917
the same hospital Monday, have been scheduled for 10 a&m& tomorrow    1.6065767145351917
in St& Anne's Catholic Church, 31978 Mound, in Warren.   1.5127085093302464
The    1.0
mother and daughter, who will be buried side by side in Mt& Olivet    1.67495327387791
Cemetery, rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott    1.6065767145351917
Funeral Home, 31730 Mound, Warren.   Mrs& Pankowski,    1.3761581156320553
61, remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion,    1.6432600607208703
which occurred while Mrs& Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's    1.6432600607208703
small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east.    1.5127085093302464
Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes    1.4513752902486308
apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski    1.6432600607208703
girls present held for her mother, because the flat lacked electricity.   1.6065767145351917
Christine's twin sister, Patricia, and Darlene Kowalski,    1.3761581156320553
8, escaped with minor burns. They are home now with the other Kowalski    1.67495327387791
children, Vicky, 14; Dennis, 6; Eleanor, 2; and Bernardine,    1.5127085093302464
1.   "All we have left in the world is one another, and we    1.67495327387791
must stay together the way Mother wanted", Kowalski said in telling    1.6065767145351917
his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon.    1.4513752902486308
Kowalski, a roofer who seldom worked last winter, already was in arrears    1.6432600607208703
on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered    1.5636360329510388
Neighbor    1.0
women, such as Mrs& Sidney Baker, 2269 Serra, Sterling Township,    1.5636360329510388
have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores    1.6065767145351917
with Kowalski's sister-in-law, Mrs& Anna Kowalski, 22111    1.3761581156320553
David, East Detroit.   Another neighbor, Mrs& Frank C&    1.4513752902486308
Smith, 2731 Pall Mall, Sterling Township, surprised Kowalski by    1.5127085093302464
coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the    1.6065767145351917
$400 funeral costs.   John C& Houghton, president of the Tareytown    1.5636360329510388
Acres Homeowners Association, followed that by announcing plans    1.4513752902486308
last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision    1.5636360329510388
on behalf of the Kowalski family.    1.2818970554302986
Houghton    1.0
said 6 p&m& Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes    1.7026049541338664
in the subdivision, which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14    1.6065767145351917
Mile road east. He said contributions also could be mailed to Post    1.6432600607208703
Office Box 553, Warren Village Station.   Vicky Kowalski    1.4513752902486308
meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost    1.6065767145351917
$25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior    1.6432600607208703
High School, 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.   Principal    1.4513752902486308
Clayton W& Pohly said he would allow a further collection between    1.6065767145351917
classes today, and revealed that ~Y-Teen Club past surpluses had    1.5636360329510388
been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs& Kowalski.    1.6432600607208703
Student Council officers announced    1.0
today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from    1.6065767145351917
a school dance held two weeks ago, and another dance for Fuhrmann's    1.6432600607208703
770 students this Friday night.   "Furhmann's faculty is proud    1.5127085093302464
that this has been a spontaneous effort, started largely among the    1.6065767145351917
students themselves, because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for    1.5636360329510388
her entire family, Pohly said.   There also were reports of a    1.6065767145351917
collection at the County Line Elementary School, 3505o Dequindre,    1.5127085093302464
which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including    1.67495327387791
Christine.    1.0
Kowalski has spoken but    1.0
little since the fire last Saturday. But today he wanted to make a public    1.7026049541338664
statement.   "I never knew there were such neighbors and    1.5127085093302464
friends around me and my family. I wasn't sure there were such people    1.67495327387791
anywhere in the world. I'll need more than a single day to find    1.67495327387791
the words to properly express my thanks to them".   1.5127085093302464
An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police    1.5636360329510388
today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against    1.6065767145351917
a youthful motorist.   Patrolman George Kimmell, of McClellan    1.4513752902486308
Station, said he would recommend a special safety citation for    1.5636360329510388
Ralph Sisk, 9230 Vernor east, a third grader at the Scripps School,    1.6432600607208703
for his assistance in the case.   Kimmell said he and Ralph    1.6065767145351917
were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon    1.5127085093302464
when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the    1.6065767145351917
pedestrian crosswalk.    1.0
Kimmell ordered the driver    1.0
to back up, watched the children safely across and was approaching    1.6065767145351917
the car when it suddenly "took off at high speed", he said, narrowly    1.67495327387791
missing him.   Commandeering a passing car, Kimmell pursued    1.4513752902486308
the fleeing vehicle, but lost it in traffic. Returning to the school    1.6432600607208703
crossing, the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized    1.6432600607208703
the driver, a neighbor, and had obtained the license number.   The    1.6065767145351917
motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees, 17, of 2433 McClellan,    1.6065767145351917
currently on probation and under court order not to drive.    1.5636360329510388
He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday    1.4513752902486308
by Traffic Judge George T& Murphy, who continued his no-driving    1.5636360329510388
probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit    1.7026049541338664
House of Correction. The jail sentence is to begin the day    1.6065767145351917
after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June.   1.5127085093302464
The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today.   1.5636360329510388
Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree    1.6065767145351917
tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire.    1.1606783668269585
In Vientiane,    1.0
the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its "friends and    1.6065767145351917
neighbors" for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive    1.6432600607208703
threatening the southeast Asian kingdom.   Britain's plans    1.3761581156320553
to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in    1.6065767145351917
London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home.   He said Britain also    1.5636360329510388
proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened,    1.5127085093302464
sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.   1.67495327387791
A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5,    1.6065767145351917
he said.    1.0
The Laos government plea for help was    1.3761581156320553
made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana. He indicated that requests    1.5636360329510388
would be made for more U&S& arms and more U&S& military    1.6065767145351917
advisers.   He declared the government is thinking of asking    1.5127085093302464
for foreign troops if the situation worsens.   One of the first    1.6065767145351917
moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States    1.6432600607208703
to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the    1.5636360329510388
current civilian body.   A note making the request was handed to    1.6065767145351917
U&S& Ambassador Winthrop G& Brown.    1.1606783668269585
The    1.0
Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been    1.6065767145351917
launched, heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam.   1.5636360329510388
The minister, describing the attacks which led up to the    1.5636360329510388
appeal, said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal    1.5636360329510388
army troops on one front- near Thakhek, in southern-central Laos.   1.5636360329510388
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent    1.5636360329510388
sources. In the past such government claims have been found    1.5636360329510388
exaggerated.    1.0
_HAVANA, APRIL 19._- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed    1.5636360329510388
by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing    1.5636360329510388
the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators.   1.5636360329510388
A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans    1.3761581156320553
as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair.   The executions    1.5127085093302464
took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their    1.67495327387791
conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar del Rio, where the    1.6065767145351917
executions took place.    1.0
The broadcast said    1.0
Anderson, a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman, and McNair,    1.5127085093302464
of Miami, were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.   1.6432600607208703
Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations    1.3761581156320553
and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded    1.6432600607208703
since the start of Fidel Castro's regime.   Anderson's    1.4513752902486308
wife and four children live in Miami.   McNair, 25, was seized    1.6065767145351917
March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload    1.67495327387791
of rifles in Pinar del Rio, about 35 miles from Havana.    1.6065767145351917
At least 20 other Americans were reported to have    1.5127085093302464
been arrested in a mass political roundup.   Among them were a    1.6065767145351917
number of newsmen, including Henry Raymont, of United Press International,    1.5636360329510388
and Robert Berrellez, of Associated Press.   So many    1.4513752902486308
Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the    1.6065767145351917
massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted    1.6065767145351917
into makeshift jails. More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested-    1.6432600607208703
100 of them Roman Catholic priests.   1.2818970554302986
Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in    1.6065767145351917
Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state, few emerge in the    1.6432600607208703
West to tell about it.   M& Kegham- the name is a pseudynom-    1.6432600607208703
was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary    1.6432600607208703
Federation (~ARF)- two reasons the Communists put    1.3761581156320553
him    1.0
away when they arrived in 1945.   Today, M& Kegham was in Detroit,    1.6432600607208703
en route to join his wife and children in California.   1.5636360329510388
Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that    1.4513752902486308
it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's    1.7026049541338664
tax laws made such a step possible.   "Emory University's    1.5127085093302464
charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of    1.5636360329510388
students on the basis of race", board chairman Henry L& Bowden    1.6065767145351917
stated.   But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory    1.5636360329510388
board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements    1.6065767145351917
at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes.   The statement    1.5636360329510388
explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law,    1.5127085093302464
tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they    1.5636360329510388
are segregated.   "Emory could not continue to operate according    1.5127085093302464
to its present standards as an institution of higher learning, of    1.6065767145351917
true university grade, and meet its financial obligations, without the    1.5636360329510388
tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it    1.6432600607208703
conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions",    1.4513752902486308
the statement said.   The statement did not mention what steps    1.5636360329510388
might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.   1.5636360329510388
An Emory spokesman indicated, however, that the university itself    1.5127085093302464
did not intend to make any test of the laws.   The Georgia    1.6432600607208703
Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from    1.5636360329510388
property taxation if, among other criteria, "all endowments to institutions    1.5636360329510388
established for white people shall be limited to white people,    1.5636360329510388
and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall    1.5636360329510388
be limited to colored people".   At least two private colleges    1.5636360329510388
in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student    1.67495327387791
bodies, but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the    1.6065767145351917
state.   Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church. Some    1.5127085093302464
church leaders, both clerical and lay, have criticized the university    1.5636360329510388
for not taking the lead in desegregation.    1.3761581156320553
The student    1.0
newspaper, The Emory Wheel, as early as the fall of 1954 called    1.6432600607208703
for desegregation.   "From its beginning", the trustees'    1.3761581156320553
statement said Friday, "Emory University has assumed as its primary    1.5636360329510388
commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning.    1.5127085093302464
Teaching, research and study, according to highest standards, under    1.5127085093302464
Christian influence, are paramount in the Emory University policy.   1.5127085093302464
"As a private institution, supported by generous individuals,    1.4513752902486308
Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no    1.5636360329510388
policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in    1.6065767145351917
scholarship and Christian education.   "There is not now, nor    1.5127085093302464
has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any    1.6065767145351917
requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race,    1.6432600607208703
color or creed. Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned,    1.6065767145351917
Emory University could now consider applications from prospective    1.4513752902486308
students, and others    1.0
seeking applications from prospective students,    1.1606783668269585
and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university,    1.6432600607208703
irrespective of race, color or creed.    1.2818970554302986
"On    1.0
the other hand, Emory University derives its corporate existence from    1.5636360329510388
the State of Georgia. **h   "When and if it can do so without    1.67495327387791
jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges    1.2818970554302986
essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities,    1.5636360329510388
Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring    1.4513752902486308
to study or work at the University without regard to race, color or    1.67495327387791
creed, continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered    1.5636360329510388
on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria    1.6065767145351917
designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university    1.6065767145351917
and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian    1.6065767145351917
higher education".   1.0
A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday    1.6432600607208703
when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue    1.7026049541338664
near Waddell Street, ~NE, police said.   The dead youth    1.5127085093302464
was identified as Robert E& Sims, 19, of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir&,    1.6432600607208703
~SE.   Patrolman G& E& Hammons said the car evidently    1.5127085093302464
slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the    1.6065767145351917
pole.   The other occupants were James Willard Olvey, 18, of    1.5636360329510388
963 Ponce de Leon Ave&, ~NE, and Larry Coleman Barnett, 19,    1.6065767145351917
of 704 Hill St&, ~SE, both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital    1.67495327387791
for severe lacerations and bruises.   1.1606783668269585
The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie    1.5636360329510388
theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and "stand-ins"    1.4513752902486308
if negotiations failed.   The demands were set forth in    1.5127085093302464
letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal    1.6432600607208703
"We intend to    1.0
attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year", the identically    1.6432600607208703
worded letters said.   The letters set a Nov& 15 deadline    1.5636360329510388
for the start of negotiations. They indicated that stand-ins and    1.5636360329510388
picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate.   1.5636360329510388
Downtown and art theater managers and owners, contacted Friday    1.5127085093302464
night for comment on the ~COAHR request, said they had no knowledge    1.6432600607208703
of such a letter, and that it was not in the Friday mail. However,    1.7026049541338664
three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the    1.67495327387791
proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend.    1.6065767145351917
The ~COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering    1.6065767145351917
of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday.    1.5636360329510388
Several theater operators said, however, that there is little likelihood    1.5636360329510388
of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair.   1.5127085093302464
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration    1.5127085093302464
several months ago. Charles A& Black, ~COAHR chairman,    1.4513752902486308
said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet    1.5636360329510388
with the students on Oct& 31 but had failed to show up. He declined    1.7026049541338664
to name the three.   Friday's letters asked for a Nov& 15    1.6065767145351917
meeting. Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend,    1.6065767145351917
the letters said, would be considered a "sign of indifference".   1.5636360329510388
Black said ~COAHR "hoped to be able to integrate the    1.5636360329510388
theaters without taking direct action, but we are pledged to using every    1.6432600607208703
legal and nonviolent means at our disposal **h"   A    1.5127085093302464
prepared    1.0
statement released by the student group Friday stated that "extensive    1.5636360329510388
research by ~COAHR into techniques and methods of theater    1.5127085093302464
integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines    1.6065767145351917
and stand-ins    1.0
before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits **h"   1.5127085093302464
Besides managers of downtown theaters, the students sent    1.4513752902486308
letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead.    1.6432600607208703

A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking    1.5127085093302464
into the home of relatives in search of his wife, hitting his uncle with    1.7026049541338664
a rock and assaulting two police officers who tried to subdue him,    1.6432600607208703
police said.   Patrolmen J& W& Slate and A& L& Crawford    1.5636360329510388
Jr& said they arrested Ronald M& Thomas, of 1671 Nakoma    1.5636360329510388

The officers gave this account:   Thomas early Sunday went    1.5127085093302464
to the home of his uncle and aunt, Mr& and Mrs& R& C& Thomas,    1.7026049541338664
511 Blanche St&, ~NW, looking for his wife, Margaret Lou    1.5636360329510388
Thomas, 18, and their 11-month-old baby.   The younger Thomas    1.5127085093302464
ripped a screen door, breaking the latch, and after an argument struck    1.6432600607208703
his uncle with a rock, scratching his face. He also struck his aunt    1.67495327387791
and wife, and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches.   1.6065767145351917
When police arrived the man was still violent, Slate said.    1.5636360329510388
He attacked one of the officers and was restrained.    1.5127085093302464
About five minutes later he jumped up, Slate said, and struck the    1.6432600607208703
two policemen again.   He was then subdued and placed in the police    1.6432600607208703
car to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches received    1.6432600607208703
in the melee. Then he attacked the two officers again and was again    1.67495327387791
restrained, Slate related.   Slate said he and Crawford received    1.5127085093302464
cuts and scratches and their uniforms were badly torn.    1.5127085093302464
Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and battery. Two counts    1.6432600607208703
of assault on an officer, resisting arrest, disturbance and cursing,    1.5636360329510388
police said. A hearing was set for 8:30 a&m& Tuesday.   1.5636360329510388
Mrs& Mary Self, who knows more than any other person about    1.6065767145351917
the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept personnel records over    1.6432600607208703
the years, has closed her desk and retired.   Over the weekend,    1.6065767145351917
Mrs& Self, personnel clerk, was a feted and honored guest of the    1.6432600607208703
Atlanta Club, organization of women employes at City Hall.    1.5127085093302464
After 18 years in the personnel office, she has taken a disability pension    1.67495327387791
on advice of her doctors.   As personnel clerk, she handled    1.5636360329510388
thousands of entries, ranging from appointments to jobs, to transfers    1.5636360329510388
to other employments, to pensions.   "I have enjoyed it and    1.5636360329510388
will feel a bit lost at least for a while", she said wistfully Friday.   1.7026049541338664
One of the largest crowds in the club's history turned out    1.6065767145351917
to pay tribute to Mrs& Self and her service.   1.5127085093302464
Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire    1.4513752902486308
ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading    1.6432600607208703
pest.   The department is planning to expand its eradication    1.5127085093302464
program soon to four additional counties- Troup, Pierce, Bryan    1.5127085093302464
and Bulloch- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants, according    1.6065767145351917
to W& E& Blasingame state entomologist.   Low-flying planes    1.4513752902486308
will spread a granular-type chemical, heptachlor, over 30,000 acres    1.5127085093302464
in Troup, 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and    1.6432600607208703
Bryan counties.   1.0
The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb    1.4513752902486308
and Jones counties, over 37,679 acres. The department has just finished    1.6065767145351917
treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon.   Also being    1.5636360329510388
treated are Houston, Bleckley, Tift, Turner and Dodge counties,    1.5127085093302464
Blasingame said. The fire ant is thought to infest approximately    1.5636360329510388
two million acres of land in Georgia, attacking crops, young wildlife    1.6065767145351917
and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic    1.7026049541338664
to its venom, Blasingame said.   1.1606783668269585
The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will    1.5636360329510388
be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week.    1.5636360329510388
This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase    1.67495327387791
of a traffic survey on the North Expressway. Students have been    1.6065767145351917
using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study.    1.6065767145351917
Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and    1.6432600607208703
suggest methods to eliminate it.   Incidentally, 14th Street    1.4513752902486308
and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight    1.5636360329510388
hours. It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue, ~NE;    1.6065767145351917

Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes, two of    1.5636360329510388
them    1.0
in a fiery crash near Snellville, the State Patrol said Sunday.   1.6065767145351917
The latest death reported was that of 4-year-old Claude Douglas    1.5636360329510388
Maynor of Calvary. Troopers said the child ran into the path    1.6065767145351917
of a passing car a half-mile north of Calvary on Georgia 111 in Grady    1.7026049541338664
County.   That death occurred at 6:50 p&m& Friday and    1.5127085093302464
was reported Sunday, the patrol said.    1.2818970554302986
An    1.0

_SALEM (SPECIAL)_- For a second month in a row, Multnomah County    1.6065767145351917
may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an    1.67495327387791
unusually high summer month's need, the state public welfare commission    1.5636360329510388
was told Friday.   It is the only county in the state so    1.6432600607208703
far this month reporting a possible shortage in ~GA category, for    1.6065767145351917
which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary.   1.6065767145351917
William Smythe, director of field service, told the commissioners    1.5127085093302464
that Multnomah, as of Aug& 22, had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted    1.67495327387791
$66,000 in the category, leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month.   1.67495327387791
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the    1.6432600607208703
month, this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000. But it probably    1.7026049541338664
will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of    1.67495327387791
each month, Smythe said. No request for emergency allotment had yet    1.6065767145351917
been received, however.    1.0
The commission, meeting    1.0
for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners, Roy    1.6065767145351917
Webster, of Hood River, and Dr& Ennis Keizer, of North Bend,    1.6065767145351917
approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing    1.6065767145351917
department who has been the center of considerable controversy in    1.5636360329510388
the past.   The contract with Ray Field, who has been converting    1.6065767145351917
the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape, would    1.5636360329510388
renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours    1.7269387314284994
a month.   Field does the planning for the machine operations    1.5636360329510388
and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to    1.6432600607208703
new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes.   1.6432600607208703
Acting Administrator Andrew F& Juras said that because    1.4513752902486308
of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program, the    1.5636360329510388
agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for    1.6432600607208703
a period.   But he emphasized that the agency must train people    1.6065767145351917
within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles, and he said he personally    1.7026049541338664
"regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the    1.6432600607208703
past".   He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency    1.5636360329510388
was literally dependent now on the machine processing, "and the whole    1.6065767145351917
wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four    1.7269387314284994
persons directing it were to leave".    1.2818970554302986
Juras    1.0
said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only    1.6065767145351917
and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not    1.6432600607208703
to other agencies of the government. He also said that the salary,    1.6432600607208703
in    1.0
terms of going rates in the field, was "modest" in terms of the man's    1.7026049541338664
responsibility. The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed,    1.5636360329510388
he said, and added Field's long service in state government    1.5636360329510388
and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program.   1.5636360329510388
"Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and    1.67495327387791
defend this contract"? asked Mrs& Grace O& Peck, representative    1.5127085093302464
from Multnomah County, of the commission chairman, Joseph E&    1.5127085093302464
Harvey Jr&.   "My feeling at the moment", he said,    1.5127085093302464
"is that we have no alternative, irrespective of some of the arguments    1.6432600607208703
about him. The continued operation of this program depends on having    1.6065767145351917
his service".    1.0
Mrs& Peck, later joined    1.0
by the commission's vice-chairman, Mrs& Lee Patterson, took Harvey    1.5127085093302464
to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary    1.6432600607208703
Club Tuesday.   A publicity release from Oregon Physicians    1.4513752902486308
Service, of which Harvey is president, quoted him as saying the welfare    1.6432600607208703
office move to Salem, instead of "crippling" the agency,    1.5127085093302464
had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses, with the    1.5636360329510388
key being improved communications between ~F+~A and the commission    1.5127085093302464
staff.   "I rather resent", she said, "you speaking to    1.5127085093302464
those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this.    1.6065767145351917
**h I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter: That the    1.7269387314284994
move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all    1.67495327387791
the people. **h The staff deserves a lot of credit working    1.6065767145351917
down here under real obstacles".   Harvey said his objective    1.5127085093302464
was to create a better public image for welfare".   1.5127085093302464
The wife of convicted bank robber Lawrence G& Huntley was    1.5636360329510388
arrested in Phoenix, Ariz&, last week and will be returned to Portland    1.6432600607208703
to face charges of assault and robbery, Portland detectives said    1.5636360329510388
Friday.   Mrs& Lavaughn Huntley is accused of driving the    1.5127085093302464
getaway car used in a robbery of the Woodyard Bros&' Grocery,    1.6065767145351917

who was sentenced to 15 years in the federal prison at McNeil Island    1.67495327387791
last April for robbery of the Hillsdale branch of Multnomah Bank,    1.6065767145351917
also was charged with the store holdup. Secret Grand Jury indictments    1.6065767145351917
were returned against the pair last week, Detective Murray Logan    1.5636360329510388
reported.   The Phoenix arrest culminates more than a year's    1.5127085093302464
investigation by Detective William Taylor and other officers. Taylor    1.5127085093302464
said Mrs& Huntley and her husband also will be questioned about    1.6065767145351917
a series of 15 Portland robberies in spring of 1959 in which the    1.67495327387791
holdup men bound their victims with tape before fleeing.   Mrs&    1.5636360329510388
Huntley was held on $20,000 bond in Phoenix. She was arrested by    1.6432600607208703
Phoenix Police after they received the indictment papers from Portland    1.5636360329510388

four of the company's eight trucks were making collections with    1.5636360329510388
both newly hired and regular workers.   Sydney Larson, a staff    1.5636360329510388
representative for the United Steel Workers, which the firm's 25    1.5636360329510388

A 62-year-old Smithfield man, Lester E& Stone of 19 Beverly    1.5636360329510388
Circle, was in satisfactory condition last night at Our Lady of    1.6065767145351917
Fatima Hospital, North Providence, with injuries suffered when a    1.5127085093302464
car he was driving struck a utility pole on Woonasquatucket Avenue    1.6065767145351917
in North Providence near Stevens Street.   Mr& Stone suffered    1.5127085093302464
fractured ribs and chest cuts, hospital authorities said. He was    1.5636360329510388
taken to the hospital by the North Providence ambulance.   Before    1.5636360329510388
hitting the pole, Mr& Stone's car brushed against a car driven    1.6065767145351917
by Alva W& Vernava, 21, of 23 Maple Ave&, North Providence,    1.6065767145351917
tearing away the rear bumper and denting the left rear fender of    1.6432600607208703
the Vernava car, police said. Mr& Vernava was uninjured.   The    1.5636360329510388
impact with the utility pole caused a brief power failure in the immediate    1.67495327387791

The fight over the Warwick School Committee's appointment    1.4513752902486308
of a coordinator of audio-visual education may go to the state Supreme    1.6432600607208703
Court, it appeared last night.   Two members of the Democratic-endorsed    1.5636360329510388
majority on the school board said they probably would vote    1.5636360329510388
to appeal a ruling by the state Board of Education, which said yesterday    1.67495327387791
that the school committee acted improperly in its appointment of    1.5636360329510388
the coordinator, Francis P& Nolan 3rd, the Democratic-endorsed    1.4513752902486308
committee chairman, could not be reached for comment.   In its    1.5636360329510388
ruling, the state Board of Education upheld Dr& Michael F& Walsh,    1.6065767145351917
state commissioner of education, who had ruled previously that    1.5127085093302464
the Warwick board erred when it named Maurice F& Tougas as coordinator    1.6432600607208703
of audio-visual education without first finding that the school    1.5127085093302464
superintendent's candidate was not suitable.   Supt& Clarence    1.3761581156320553

The award was made by Judge Fred B& Perkins who heard their    1.6432600607208703
petition without a jury by agreement of the parties.   The award,    1.6065767145351917
without interest, compared with a valuation of $57,500 placed on the    1.6065767145351917
property by the property owners' real estate expert, and a valuation    1.6065767145351917

The ~FBI yesterday arrested    1.0
on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach    1.7269387314284994
a verdict in the "Freedom Rider" bus burning trial four weeks    1.6065767145351917
ago.   U&S& Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint,    1.5127085093302464
charged that the juror gave false information when asked about    1.5636360329510388
Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury.   He identified    1.5636360329510388
the man as Lewis Martin Parker, 59, a farmer of Hartselle,    1.6065767145351917
Ala&.   Eight men were tried together in U&S& District    1.5127085093302464
Court in Anniston, Ala&, on charges of interfering with interstate    1.5636360329510388
transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack    1.5636360329510388
on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders. The    1.6432600607208703
bus was    1.0
burned outside Anniston.   One of the eight defendants was    1.5127085093302464
freed on a directed verdict of acquittal. A mistrial was declared in    1.6432600607208703
the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on    1.7026049541338664
a verdict.   The arrest of Mr& Parker marks the third charge    1.6065767145351917
of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case.   The first    1.6065767145351917
incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H&    1.6065767145351917
Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering    1.6432600607208703
efforts.   He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone    1.6432600607208703
outside the court had spoken to them about the case. Two members    1.6432600607208703
of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their    1.67495327387791
homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial. Neither    1.5636360329510388
was seated on the jury.   Then, when the case went to the    1.6432600607208703
jury, the judge excused one of the jurors, saying the juror had told him    1.7026049541338664
he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the    1.7026049541338664
trial opened. The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient.    1.7026049541338664
The judge replaced the juror with an alternate.   No formal    1.5636360329510388
charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported    1.67495327387791
incidents.   At the opening of the trial, the jury panel was questioned    1.6432600607208703
as a group by Mr& Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections.   1.6065767145351917
One member of the panel- not Mr& Parker- indicated    1.5127085093302464
he had been a member of the ~KKK at one time. He was not seated    1.7269387314284994
on the jury.   The perjury charge against Mr& Parker carries    1.5636360329510388
a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction.    1.6432600607208703

_ASILOMAR, MARCH 26_ Vast spraying programs conducted by "technicians    1.5127085093302464
with narrow training and little wisdom" are endangering crops    1.5127085093302464
and wildlife, Carl W& Buchheister, president of the National Audubon    1.5636360329510388
Society, said today.   "It is like handing a loaded .45    1.5636360329510388
automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play", he    1.67495327387791
commented.   Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon    1.5127085093302464
Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy    1.5127085093302464
its target, the fire ant.   "But it did destroy the natural    1.6065767145351917
controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane    1.7026049541338664
crop", he said.   The conservation leader said other mistakes    1.5127085093302464
in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming. There    1.6065767145351917
have even been serious errors in the U& S& Forest Service,    1.6065767145351917
whose    1.0
officials pride themselves in their scientific training, he added.   1.5127085093302464
"The news of their experiments reach the farmers who, forgetting    1.5636360329510388
that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents,    1.6432600607208703
are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally    1.6432600607208703
peck their grapes or their blueberries", Buchheister told the delegates.   1.5636360329510388
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying,    1.5127085093302464
Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill, creation    1.5127085093302464
of national seashore parks, including Point Reyes; preservation    1.4513752902486308
of the wetlands where birds breed; a pesticides co-ordination act;    1.5636360329510388
stronger water pollution control programs, and Federal ratification    1.4513752902486308
of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by    1.6065767145351917

The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin    1.5636360329510388
county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon    1.6065767145351917
Society.   Mrs& Norman Livermore, president of the Marin    1.4513752902486308
Conservation League, handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands    1.5636360329510388
tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W& Buchheister, president    1.5636360329510388
of the Society.   The presentation was made before several    1.5127085093302464
hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall,    1.6432600607208703
College of Marin, Kentfield.   Buchheister pledged the land    1.4513752902486308
would be an "inviolate" sanctuary for all birds, animals and plants.   1.6065767145351917
Seventeen years ago today, German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed    1.5127085093302464
into a makeshift cockpit installed in a ~V-1 rocket-bomb that    1.5636360329510388
was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber.   The World    1.6065767145351917
War /2, German bomber rolled down a runway and took off.   1.6065767145351917
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the    1.7026049541338664
pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip. This had never been done    1.7026049541338664
before.   Now a quiet-spoken, middle-aged man, Fiedler is an    1.5127085093302464
aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division    1.4513752902486308
at Sunnyvale, where he played a key role in the development of the    1.67495327387791
Navy's Polaris missile.   He sat in his office yesterday and    1.5636360329510388
recalled that historic flight in 1944.   "The first two pilots    1.5636360329510388
had crashed", he said. "I had developed the machines and therefore    1.6065767145351917
knew them. It was time to go up myself".   Fiedler was then    1.6432600607208703
technical director of Hitler's super-secret "Reichenberg project",    1.3761581156320553
which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war.   1.5636360329510388
About 200 of the special ~V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready    1.6432600607208703
for manned flight with an explosive warhead. The target was Allied    1.6065767145351917
shipping- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of    1.6065767145351917
Europe.   The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's    1.5127085093302464
flight.   Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by    1.5636360329510388
the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism, the scientist waited while    1.5127085093302464
the bomber gained altitude.   At 12,000 feet, Fiedler signaled    1.5127085093302464
"release", and started the roaring pulse-jet engine- then streaked    1.5127085093302464
away from beneath the Heinkel.   To the German pilot in the    1.6065767145351917
bomber the rocket became a faint black speck, hurtling through the    1.6065767145351917
sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m&p&h&.   It was probably    1.6432600607208703
man's first successful flight in a missile. "She flew beautifully",    1.5636360329510388
said Fiedler. "There was only one power control- a valve    1.5636360329510388
to adjust the fuel flow. I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to    1.7026049541338664
the test strip".   Using a steering system that controlled the    1.5636360329510388
modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons,    1.5127085093302464
Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the    1.67495327387791
fuselage.   He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed    1.6065767145351917
of 200 m&p&h&- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown-    1.6065767145351917
and banked into the airfield.   Moments later the ~V-1 skimmed    1.5636360329510388
across the landing strip, edging closer and closer to a touchdown-    1.6065767145351917
then in a streamer of dust it landed.   Fiedler went on to make    1.67495327387791
several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg    1.6065767145351917
missiles.   The missiles were to be armed with an underwater    1.5636360329510388
bomb. Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water,    1.6432600607208703
striking below the waterline of individual ships.   A crack corps    1.5636360329510388
of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers, but the project    1.67495327387791
was halted before the end of the war, and the missiles later fell into    1.7026049541338664
Allied hands.   Now a family man with three children, Fiedler    1.5636360329510388
lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale.    1.6432600607208703
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders.   "It's    1.5127085093302464
so quiet", he said, "so slow, serene- and so challenging".   1.5636360329510388

In a letter to the American Friends Service, Dr& Schweitzer    1.5636360329510388
wrote:   "Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep    1.6065767145351917
busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event    1.6065767145351917
the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out.   "They    1.5127085093302464
cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons    1.67495327387791
imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack. The only    1.5636360329510388
way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons;    1.67495327387791
otherwise no peace is possible.   "Governments apparently    1.3761581156320553
do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger;    1.67495327387791
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly    1.5127085093302464
stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency".   1.6432600607208703
A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation    1.6065767145351917
of the affairs of Ben Stein, 47, who collected big fees as    1.6432600607208703
a "labor consultant" and operator of a janitors' service.    1.5127085093302464
Before he testified for 20 minutes, Stein, who lives at 3300 Lake    1.6432600607208703
Shore dr&, admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with    1.6432600607208703
crime syndicate hoodlums.    1.0
Among his gangland    1.0
buddies, he said, were    1.0
Joseph [Joey] Glimco, a mob labor racketeer,    1.3761581156320553
and four gang gambling chiefs, Gus [Slim] Alex, Ralph Pierce,    1.5636360329510388
Joe [Caesar] DiVarco, and Jimmy [Monk] Allegretti.    1.3761581156320553
Another hoodlum, Louis Arger, drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor    1.5127085093302464
firm, the National Maintenance company, in three years ending in 1959,    1.6065767145351917
Stein disclosed in an interview.   "I put Arger on the payroll    1.6065767145351917
because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy    1.6432600607208703
pier", Stein said. "But Arger never was able to produce it, so    1.6432600607208703
I cut him off my payroll".    1.2818970554302986
Other witnesses,    1.0
after appearances before the jury, which reportedly is probing    1.5127085093302464
into possible income tax violations, disclosed that government prosecutors    1.5127085093302464
were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of    1.6432600607208703
gangsters, including Glimco and Alex.   The federal lawyers,    1.4513752902486308
according to their witnesses, also were tracing Stein's fees as a    1.6065767145351917
labor consultant. Under scrutiny, two of the witnesses said, were payments    1.6065767145351917
and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison    1.5636360329510388
st&.   The company supplies janitors and workmen for    1.4513752902486308
McCormick    1.0
Place and factories, liquor firms, and other businesses.    1.4513752902486308
Among the witnesses were Ed J& Lee, director of    1.5127085093302464
McCormick Place; Jerome Leavitt, a partner in the Union Liquor    1.5636360329510388
company, 3247 S& Kedzie av&, Dominic Senese, a teamster union    1.5636360329510388
slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo, onetime    1.7026049541338664
gang chief; and Frank W& Pesce, operator of a Glimco dominated    1.6065767145351917
deodorant firm, the Best Sanitation and Supply company, 1215    1.5127085093302464
Blue Island av&.   Lee said he had told the jury that he made    1.67495327387791
an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors    1.6065767145351917
in McCormick Place. Stein's fee, Lee said, was 10 per cent of    1.6432600607208703
the janitors' pay. Stein estimated this amount at "about $1,500    1.5636360329510388
or $1,600 a month".    1.0
Leavitt, as he entered    1.0
the jury room, said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500    1.67495327387791
his liquor firm paid to Stein for "labor consultant work" with    1.6065767145351917
five unions which organized Leavitt's workers. Leavitt identified    1.4513752902486308
the unions as a warehouseman's local, the teamsters union, a salesman's    1.6065767145351917
union, the janitors' union, and a bottling workers' union.   1.5127085093302464
Government attorneys, Leavitt said, have questioned him closely    1.4513752902486308
about "five or six loans" totaling about $40,000 which the liquor    1.6065767145351917
company made to Stein in the last year.   All of the loans,    1.6432600607208703
in amounts up to $5,000 each, have been repaid by Stein, according    1.6432600607208703
to Leavitt. Stein said he needed the money, Leavitt said, to "meet    1.6432600607208703
the payroll" at National Maintenance company.   The deodorant    1.4513752902486308
firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's    1.6065767145351917
discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island av&.   1.5127085093302464
The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded    1.5636360329510388
a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over    1.67495327387791
Chicago yesterday.   The reading, which has been watched    1.4513752902486308
with    1.0
interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was 4    1.6065767145351917
on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below the danger point,    1.67495327387791
according to the board of health.   The weather bureau has estimated    1.6065767145351917
that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week.    1.6065767145351917
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that    1.67495327387791
an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation.   1.7026049541338664
Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake av&, Wilmette, was arrested    1.6065767145351917
yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling    1.5636360329510388
an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings    1.5636360329510388
and Loan association, 1 S& Dearborn st&, where he formerly    1.5636360329510388
was employed    1.0
as an attorney.   Federal prosecutors estimated that the    1.4513752902486308
amount may total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association estimated    1.6065767145351917
its loss at approximately $10,000.    1.1606783668269585
Huff's attorney, Antone F& Gregorio, quoted his client as saying    1.5636360329510388
that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff, as    1.6065767145351917
attorney for the loan association, in satisfaction of mechanic's liens    1.5636360329510388
on property on which the association held mortgages.   Huff told    1.5636360329510388
Gregorio that he took the money to pay "the ordinary bills and    1.6432600607208703
expenses of suburban living".   Huff, who received a salary of    1.5636360329510388
$109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September    1.67495327387791
of this year, said that his private practice was not lucrative.    1.6065767145351917
Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their four children, 6 to 10 years    1.7026049541338664
old, in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage.    1.5127085093302464
The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by    1.6065767145351917
Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.   The shortage was    1.5636360329510388
discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept& 18. On    1.6432600607208703
that date, according to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room    1.67495327387791
in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av&. There, Gregorio    1.6065767145351917
said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense.   Later,    1.5636360329510388
Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House, using    1.6432600607208703
a credit card. All bounced.   When Huff attempted to cash another    1.6065767145351917
$100 check there Monday, hotel officials called police.    1.4513752902486308
_BONN, OCT& 24 (~UPI)_- Greece and West Germany have ratified    1.5636360329510388
an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek    1.5636360329510388
victims of Nazi persecution, it was announced today.   1.4513752902486308
PROBABLY THE hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment    1.5636360329510388
community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue, which was    1.6065767145351917
sold to the public during the past week.   For many reasons, the    1.6432600607208703
demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous.    1.5636360329510388
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the    1.67495327387791
stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers    1.7269387314284994
and explaining to others why they had no more to sell.   Investors    1.6432600607208703
who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25, and customers    1.67495327387791
who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100    1.7026049541338664
and counted themselves lucky to get that many.   In fact, very    1.6065767145351917
few customers, anywhere in the nation, were able to get more than 100    1.67495327387791
shares. Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares, for all of    1.6432600607208703
their customers.   A measure of how hot the stock was, can be    1.6432600607208703
found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.   1.7026049541338664
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share.    1.7026049541338664
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler,    1.4513752902486308
Guerin + Turner, the managing underwriter, was at $17 a share. And    1.6065767145351917
from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday    1.67495327387791
morning at around $22 a share.   But the Morton Foods issue    1.6065767145351917
was hot long before it was on the market. Indeed, from the moment the    1.7026049541338664
reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last    1.6065767145351917
January, the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up.   1.6065767145351917
Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the    1.6432600607208703
nation, all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would    1.7026049541338664
be sold (185,000 to the public at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved    1.6432600607208703
for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share).   There was even    1.6065767145351917
a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned    1.67495327387791
about the Dallas stock offering. "We subscribe 500 shares of Morton    1.6065767145351917
Foods of Texas. Cable confirmation", it said translated. But    1.5127085093302464
E&G&T& could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares.   1.6065767145351917
After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group    1.6065767145351917
members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.   1.6432600607208703
But the result of it all was, E&G&T& partner Dean Guerin    1.6065767145351917
believes, an effective distribution of the stock to owners all    1.5636360329510388
over the nation.   "I feel confident the stock will qualify for    1.6065767145351917
the 'national list'", he said, meaning its market price would    1.5636360329510388
be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country.   He was    1.6065767145351917
also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved    1.6065767145351917
again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a    1.67495327387791
job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do.   1.67495327387791
But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one?   1.6432600607208703
The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.   1.5636360329510388
First, the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last    1.6432600607208703
few months, driving stocks of all kinds up. As a result, it is not    1.7026049541338664
easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced (at roughly    1.7026049541338664
10 times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64~c    1.7269387314284994
anticipated dividend).   Second, the "potato chip industry"    1.3761581156320553
has caught the fancy of investors lately, and until Morton Foods    1.6065767145351917
came along there were only two potato chip stocks- Frito and H&    1.6432600607208703
W& Lay- on the market.   Both of those have had dynamic run-ups    1.6432600607208703
in price on the market in recent months, both were selling at higher    1.67495327387791
price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market    1.5636360329510388
at, and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock    1.6432600607208703
to have a fast run-up.   And third, the potato chip industry has    1.6432600607208703
taken on the flavor of a "growth" industry in the public mind of    1.67495327387791
late. Foods, which long had been considered "recession resistant"    1.5127085093302464
but hardly dynamic stocks, have been acting like growth stocks, going    1.6065767145351917
to higher price-earnings ratios.   The potato chip industry these    1.5127085093302464
days is growing, not only as a    1.3761581156320553
result of population increase and public    1.2818970554302986
acceptance of convenience foods, but also because of a combination    1.5636360329510388
of circumstances    1.0
that has led to growth by merger.   The history of the    1.6065767145351917
U&S& potato chip industry is that many of today's successful    1.5636360329510388
companies got started during the deep depression days. Those that remain    1.6065767145351917
are those that were headed by strong executives, men with the abilities    1.6432600607208703
to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.   1.6432600607208703
But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and    1.6065767145351917
suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their    1.6065767145351917
closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management    1.6065767145351917
in their firms.   So they go looking for mergers with other    1.6065767145351917
firms that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they pound on    1.6432600607208703
the doors of firms like Frito.   All those things combined to    1.6065767145351917
make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.   1.67495327387791
Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known as Chip-o's,    1.6065767145351917
turns out to sell as well as its stock did, the stock may turn out    1.7269387314284994
to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up    1.7269387314284994
to.    1.0
Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and    1.6065767145351917
distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies, valued in the    1.6065767145351917
millions of dollars.   More than 10 companies maintain facilities    1.5127085093302464
in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at    1.6432600607208703
Sherman.   It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's    1.5636360329510388
Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their    1.6432600607208703
52-year history.   The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at    1.5127085093302464
the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars. It    1.67495327387791
weighs in the tons, so the proximity of factory and exhibition area    1.6432600607208703
makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year.   A modern    1.6065767145351917
cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000, and it's    1.6065767145351917
a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U&S&    1.67495327387791
and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area.    1.5127085093302464
The Murray Co& of Texas, Inc&, originated in Dallas in 1896.    1.6065767145351917
They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's. More than    1.6065767145351917
700 employes make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown.   1.6065767145351917
Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except    1.5127085093302464
for driers and cleaners, and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based    1.6432600607208703
firm.   The Continental Gin Co& began operations in    1.4513752902486308
Dallas in 1899. The present company is a combination of several smaller    1.6432600607208703
ones that date back to 1834.   Headquarters is in Birmingham,    1.5636360329510388
Ala&. Factories are located here and in Prattville, Ala&.    1.5127085093302464
About    1.0
40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by    1.67495327387791
more than 200 employes.   The company sells a complete line of    1.6065767145351917
gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world.   Hardwicke-Etter    1.4513752902486308
Co& of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment.    1.6432600607208703
The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern    1.5127085093302464
states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co&. They    1.6432600607208703
export also.   The company began operation in 1900 with hardware    1.5636360329510388
and oil mill supplies. In 1930, they began making cotton processing    1.6065767145351917
equipment. Presently, Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people, depending    1.3761581156320553
on the season of the year.   The Lummus Cotton Gin Co&    1.6065767145351917
has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912. Factory    1.6432600607208703
operations are in Columbus, Ga&. The district office here employs    1.5636360329510388
about 65.   The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co& and Gordin    1.5636360329510388
Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here. The cleaner    1.5636360329510388
equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system, which    1.6065767145351917
turns out a complete ginning system, began operations in 1959.    1.5636360329510388
Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.   The John E&    1.5127085093302464
Mitchell Co& began work in Dallas in 1928. The firm is prominent    1.6432600607208703
in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton, driers, and heaters,    1.5636360329510388
and they lay claim to being the first maker (1910) of boil extraction    1.67495327387791
equipment.   The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes    1.5127085093302464
cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation.   1.5636360329510388
Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people. They export cotton    1.6065767145351917
ginning machinery.   The Hinckley Gin Supply Co& is a maker    1.5636360329510388
of "overhead equipment". This includes driers, cleaners, burr    1.4513752902486308
extractors, separators and piping that's located above gin stands in    1.5636360329510388
a complete gin.   The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells    1.6432600607208703
equipment in the central cotton belt, including the Mississippi    1.5127085093302464
Delta.   The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co& has home offices    1.5127085093302464
and factory facilities here. They make gin saws and deal in parts, supplies    1.67495327387791
and some used gin machinery.   The Stacy Co& makes cleaning    1.5636360329510388
and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas. They've been    1.5636360329510388
in Dallas since 1921.   Cotton Belt Gin Service, Inc&    1.5127085093302464
of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago. They distribute    1.67495327387791
equipment in 11 states. The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies    1.67495327387791
such as belting, bearings, etc&.   Cotton processing equipment    1.4513752902486308
is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy.    1.4513752902486308
New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of    1.6432600607208703
recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year.   1.5636360329510388
Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000    1.5636360329510388
mark in March for the first time this year.   Totaling 3,399,    1.6065767145351917
sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963. However, compared    1.5636360329510388
with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441, this March was off 23 per    1.7026049541338664
cent.   On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, the first quarter of    1.5127085093302464
1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's    1.67495327387791
3-month total of 11,744.   This year-to-year decline for Dallas    1.5127085093302464
County closely follows the national trend- estimated sales of domestic    1.5636360329510388
cars in the U&S& for first three months of 1961 were about    1.6432600607208703
1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier.   1.7269387314284994
With the March pickup, dealers are optimistic that the    1.5127085093302464
April-June quarter will equal or top last year. The March gain plus    1.6432600607208703
this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost    1.6432600607208703
production schedules for the next quarter.   On the local level,    1.5636360329510388
compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense    1.67495327387791
of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars. Only three standard    1.5636360329510388
models- Buick, Chrysler, and Mercury- had slight year-to-year    1.4513752902486308
gains in March sales in the county.   1.3761581156320553

came under fire in Dallas last week.   The Administration's    1.5127085093302464
proposals, complex and sweeping as they are, all deal with fringe    1.6065767145351917

_SANTA BARBARA_- "The present recovery movement will gather steady    1.5127085093302464

Gaither + Anderson, urged the U&S& to "throw down the    1.5127085093302464
gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be    1.6432600607208703
pushed arouny any more". He urged support for President Kennedy's    1.5636360329510388
Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement    1.3761581156320553
in economic activity was not a "temporary flash in the pan"    1.6065767145351917
but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry    1.6065767145351917
the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our    1.67495327387791
traditional growth pattern.   "In view of the current expansion,    1.5127085093302464
which promises to be substantial" he said the odds appear to favor    1.6432600607208703
rising interest rates in coming months, but "there is reason to    1.6065767145351917

in late 1959 and 1960".    1.1606783668269585
Sprinkel strongly refuted    1.0
the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of    1.6065767145351917
limited and slow growth, declaring that this pessimism "is based    1.5636360329510388
on    1.0
very limited and questionable evidence".   Rather than viewing    1.4513752902486308
the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost    1.67495327387791
prospects for growth", he said "it should be viewed as a lesson    1.6432600607208703
well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement    1.5636360329510388
in this recovery".    1.0
He cautioned that "the    1.0
greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government    1.6065767145351917
which could bring moderate inflation".   The economist    1.3761581156320553
does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery    1.67495327387791
and believes it "even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will    1.6065767145351917
aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn    1.6065767145351917
as was the case in 1958".   The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion,    1.5636360329510388
he said, was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our    1.6432600607208703
economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies    1.6065767145351917
combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike.    1.5127085093302464
Draper declared, "As I see it, this    1.3761581156320553
country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today. We    1.6432600607208703
must justify our heritage. We must be ready for any needed sacrifice".   1.6432600607208703
He said that from his experience of two years with Gen&    1.6065767145351917
Clay in West Berlin administration, that "Russia respects our show    1.5636360329510388
of strength, but that presently we're not acting as we should and    1.6432600607208703
must".   He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail    1.5636360329510388
action, and noted that in war "you can't buy yourself out and    1.6432600607208703
that's what we're trying to do".   While he declined to suggest,    1.6065767145351917
how, he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro,    1.67495327387791
"for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this    1.6432600607208703
hemisphere. Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and    1.67495327387791
I don't believe we can permit that".    1.3761581156320553
_NEW YORK (~AP)_- {Stock market Tuesday staged a technical    1.5127085093302464
recovery, erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press    1.5636360329510388
average and making the largest gain in about two weeks.}   Analysts    1.6065767145351917
saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under    1.67495327387791
way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for "support    1.6432600607208703
level" represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial    1.5636360329510388
average. It was a level at which some of the investors standing on    1.67495327387791
the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented    1.6065767145351917
in the averages.    1.0
Although it looked like a routine    1.2818970554302986
technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some    1.5636360329510388
good news. A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods    1.67495327387791
was reported for last month.   Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon    1.5127085093302464
said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next    1.6432600607208703
year, paving the way for lower taxes.   The Dow Jones industrial    1.6065767145351917
average advanced 7.19 to 687.87.   Of 1,253 issues traded, 695    1.5636360329510388
advanced and 354 declined. New highs for the year totaled nine and    1.6432600607208703
new lows 14.   Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day.    1.5636360329510388

A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was    1.6065767145351917
envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G& Peterson, head    1.6065767145351917
of one of the world's greatest camera firms, in a key address before    1.67495327387791
the American Marketing Assn&.   However, Peterson, president    1.3761581156320553
of Bell + Howell, warned 800 U&S& marketing leaders attending    1.5127085093302464
a national conference at the Ambassador, that the future will    1.5636360329510388
belong to the industrialist of creative and "unconventional wisdom".    1.5127085093302464
"As we look to the $800 billion economy    1.4513752902486308
that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer    1.67495327387791
expenditures that will be required to reach that goal, management    1.5636360329510388
can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new    1.67495327387791
products will be created and marketed", Peterson said.   "With    1.5127085093302464
this kind of new product log-jam, the premium for brilliant    1.5636360329510388
product    1.0
planning will obviously go up geometrically".   The executive    1.4513752902486308
paid tribute to research and development and technology for their    1.5636360329510388
great contributions in the past, but he also cautioned industry that    1.6065767145351917
they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace    1.7026049541338664
within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which    1.6432600607208703
it often needs.    1.0
Peterson said America has nothing    1.1606783668269585
to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both    1.67495327387791
marketing and product ideas. He cited, as an example, how the American    1.6432600607208703
camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition    1.5636360329510388
of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs, by improving its production    1.6065767145351917
know-how and technology.   He also used as an example the    1.5636360329510388
manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany, with    1.5127085093302464
the result that it became the best selling camera in the German    1.6432600607208703

on Oct& 23, 1959, and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on    1.7026049541338664
Feb& 8, 1960. Something has gone wrong some place. I am getting    1.6432600607208703
dividends on only 50 shares. In other words, I am getting only half    1.67495327387791
the dividends I should. _ANSWER_- Write to the fund's custodian    1.5636360329510388
bank- the First National Bank of Jersey City, N&J&.    1.5127085093302464
That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock    1.6432600607208703
Fund, Fundamental Investors, Diversified Investment Fund and    1.3761581156320553
Television-Electronics Fund.   The bank installed a magnetic    1.3761581156320553
tape electronic data processing system to handle things. But it seems    1.6065767145351917
that this "electronic brain" wasn't "programmed" correctly.   1.3761581156320553
This resulted in a great number of errors. And letters began    1.6065767145351917
to come in to this column from irate shareholders.   I visited    1.6065767145351917
the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation. At that time,    1.7026049541338664
the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation    1.67495327387791
in hand. They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all    1.7026049541338664
old errors would be corrected    1.1606783668269585
"within 60 days".   That 60-day    1.1606783668269585
period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of    1.6432600607208703
these four funds, complaining about mistakes in their accounts.    1.5127085093302464
Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers    1.6432600607208703
expected. Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake    1.6432600607208703
in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank.   {Doyle    1.6432600607208703

to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations,    1.5127085093302464
"there is no reason, in my judgment why the international financial    1.6065767145351917

future".    1.0
_WASHINGTON (~UPI)_- New York Central Railroad president Alfred    1.4513752902486308
E& Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of    1.6065767145351917
bankruptcy if the Chesapeake + Ohio and Baltimore + Ohio Railroads    1.5127085093302464
merge.   Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect    1.5636360329510388
of the merger, but could possibly be an ultimate effect.   The    1.6065767145351917
railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate    1.6065767145351917
Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the ~C+~O's    1.6065767145351917
request to control and then merge with the ~B+~O.   1.5127085093302464
"All these kind of things weaken us", Perlman said.    1.5127085093302464
Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore + Ohio    1.4513752902486308
Railroad Co&, testified the ~B+~O was in its worst financial    1.5636360329510388
condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic    1.5636360329510388
lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad.   1.6065767145351917
"The financial situation of the Baltimore + Ohio,    1.3761581156320553
has become precarious- much worse than at any time since the depression    1.6432600607208703
of the 1930s", he told the hearing.   ~C+~O president    1.5127085093302464
Walter J& Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New    1.5636360329510388
York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing    1.5636360329510388
the complex case.   The New York Central also has asked the    1.6065767145351917
~ICC to permit it to gain control of the ~B+~O.   Central    1.6065767145351917
was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to    1.6065767145351917
make it a three-way merger. The proposed ~C+~O-~B+~O railroad    1.5127085093302464
would make it the hemisphere's second largest.    1.3761581156320553
_WASHINGTON (~AP)_- The government's short-term borrowing costs    1.3761581156320553
rose with Tuesday weekly offering of Treasury bills. On $1.1 billion    1.6065767145351917
of 90-day bills, the average yield was 2.325%. The rate a week    1.6432600607208703
ago was 2.295%.    1.0
_WASHINGTON, MARCH 11 (~UPI)._- "Consumer uncertain about economic    1.4513752902486308
conditions".   This was the chief reason for a so-so sales    1.5636360329510388
outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National    1.6065767145351917
Housing Center.   Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more    1.5127085093302464
of the builders were "resistance to high interest rates, cost advantage    1.6065767145351917
of buying over renting has narrowed, shelter market nearing saturation    1.5636360329510388
and prospects unable to qualify".    1.1606783668269585
The    1.0
poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference.    1.5636360329510388
It disclosed that the builders:   Expect their own production    1.5127085093302464
volume, and presumably sales, to jump 30 percent in 1961.   1.5636360329510388
Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent    1.6065767145351917
this year from 1960's 1,257,7000 non-farm housing starts. The industry    1.5636360329510388
has said 1960 was a poor year. Starts were down 20 percent from    1.67495327387791
1959.   Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for    1.5127085093302464
themselves and for the industry?    1.1606783668269585
The    1.0
reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders invited to the    1.6432600607208703
intentions conference "are generally among the more successful businessmen,    1.5127085093302464
and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders".    1.5127085093302464
_ELBURN, ILL&_- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back    1.5127085093302464
in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales: "We've    1.67495327387791
sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for    1.6432600607208703
10 more. We sold only four pickers all last year".   Gus Ehlers,    1.6432600607208703
competitor of Mr& Houtz in this farm community, says his business    1.6065767145351917
since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier. "Before    1.6065767145351917
then, my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%",    1.7026049541338664
he says.   Though the sales gains these two dealers are    1.5636360329510388
experiencing are above average for their business, farm equipment sales    1.5636360329510388
are climbing in most rural areas. Paradoxically, the sales rise is    1.6065767145351917
due in large    1.0
measure to Government efforts to slash farm output. Although    1.5127085093302464
the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point    1.5636360329510388
since 1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather,    1.6432600607208703
are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced    1.6432600607208703
to buy new harvesting machines. Fields of corn and some other crops    1.6432600607208703
in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them    1.6432600607208703
efficiently.    1.0
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation,    1.5127085093302464
together with rising prices for farm products, are pushing up farm income,    1.6432600607208703
making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery.   1.5636360329510388
Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery    1.67495327387791
say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown    1.6432600607208703
gains averaging nearly 10% above last year. "In August our dealers    1.6065767145351917
sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September    1.6432600607208703
retail sales were 14% higher than last year", says Mark V&    1.6065767145351917
Keeler, farm equipment vice president of International Harvester    1.4513752902486308
Co&. For the year to date, sales of the company's farm equipment    1.6432600607208703
dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960.    1.3761581156320553
Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states,    1.5636360329510388
two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains    1.67495327387791
from a year earlier, with the increases ranging from 5% to 50%.    1.6432600607208703
Not all sections are showing an upswing, however; the drought-seared    1.5636360329510388
North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend.   1.6065767145351917
The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends    1.5636360329510388
beyond the farm equipment industry. The demand for farm machinery    1.5636360329510388
is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally. Farmers spend    1.6065767145351917
more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group    1.67495327387791
of products. More than 20 million people live on farms and they own    1.67495327387791
a fourth of the nation's trucks, buy more gasoline than any other    1.6432600607208703
industry and provide a major market for home appliances, chemicals and    1.6065767145351917
other products.   Farmers are so eager for new machinery that    1.5636360329510388
they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago, dealers    1.6432600607208703
report.   "Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so    1.5636360329510388
we can get more money on a sale", says Jack Martin, who sells J&    1.7026049541338664
I& Case tractors and implements in Sioux City, Iowa. "This    1.5636360329510388
morning, we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on    1.7026049541338664
a new $2,700 model. Last year, we probably would have given him $700    1.67495327387791
for a comparable machine". Mr& Martin sold 21 tractors in August;    1.6065767145351917
in August of 1960, he sold seven.    1.3761581156320553
With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year    1.6432600607208703
ago, the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately    1.6432600607208703
by the country's farm equipment manufacturers. For example, farm    1.5127085093302464
equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed    1.4513752902486308
about 5% above a year earlier, Mr& Keeler reports.   Tractor    1.5636360329510388
production at Massey-Ferguson, Ltd&, of Toronto in July and    1.5127085093302464
August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier,    1.7026049541338664
says John Staiger, vice president.   With the lower dealer    1.5127085093302464
inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there    1.5127085093302464
could be shortages of some implements. Merritt D& Hill, Ford Motor    1.6065767145351917
Co& vice president, says his company is starting to get calls    1.6065767145351917
daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping    1.5636360329510388
dates on orders for corn pickers.   Except for a few months    1.6065767145351917
in late 1960 and early 1961, retail farm equipment sales have trailed    1.6432600607208703
year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959. The rise in sales    1.6432600607208703
last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program    1.6065767145351917
was adopted; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20%    1.6065767145351917
in    1.0
planted acreage and, as a result, reduced the immediate need for machines.   1.6432600607208703
Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers    1.5127085093302464
say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement    1.6432600607208703
in crop prospects. Total farm output for this year is officially    1.6065767145351917
forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average, three points higher than    1.6065767145351917
the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960.   1.67495327387791
The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects. Agriculture    1.5127085093302464
Department economists estimate the Government this year will    1.4513752902486308
hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments,    1.5636360329510388
well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639    1.67495327387791
million of 1960. Price support loans may total another $1 billion    1.6065767145351917
this year. With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly    1.6065767145351917
above 1960, farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion, $1.5    1.6065767145351917
billion above 1960's record high. Net income may reach $12.7 billion,    1.6065767145351917
up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953. The Government    1.6432600607208703
reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers    1.6065767145351917
rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month,    1.6432600607208703
reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July.   1.6065767145351917
{KENNEDY OPPOSES any widespread relief from a High Court    1.5127085093302464
depletion ruling.}   The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960    1.4513752902486308
was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it    1.7026049541338664
mined. The company, in figuring its taxable earnings, deducted a percentage    1.6065767145351917
of the revenue it received for its finished products. Such "depletion    1.6065767145351917
allowances", in the form of percentages of sales are authorized    1.5636360329510388
by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their    1.6065767145351917
assets. The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage    1.6432600607208703
allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground,    1.6432600607208703
not to the revenue from finished products.   A measure passed    1.5636360329510388
by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact, on    1.5636360329510388
prior-year returns still under review, for clay-mining companies that    1.5127085093302464
make brick and tile products. The measure allows such companies in    1.6065767145351917
those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the    1.6432600607208703
value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay    1.67495327387791
alone.   <President Kennedy, in signing the relief measure    1.4513752902486308
into law, stressed he regarded it as an exception. "My approval of    1.6432600607208703
this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment    1.67495327387791

A RULE on the Federal deductibility of state taxes    1.5127085093302464
is contested.}   A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax    1.5636360329510388
under Federal law, on its gain from the sale of property disposed    1.6432600607208703
of in line with a plan of liquidation. Louisiana, however, collected    1.6065767145351917
an income tax on the profits from the sale. The corporation, in filing    1.67495327387791
its final Federal income return, claimed the state tax payment as a    1.6432600607208703
deductible expense, as permitted under U&S& tax law.   The    1.5127085093302464
Revenue Service disallowed the claim, invoking a law provision that    1.5636360329510388
generally bars deductions    1.0
for expenses incurred in connection with what    1.3761581156320553
it said was tax-exempt income. The Tax Court rejected this view.    1.6065767145351917
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the    1.7026049541338664
exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations.   1.67495327387791

The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had    1.6432600607208703
to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager. The Court upheld    1.7026049541338664
the taxpayer's contention that these "kickbacks" were not his    1.5127085093302464

for example, may be entitled to distributions under the company's    1.5636360329510388

be taxed on the pensions when received, of course, but the company's    1.6432600607208703

sort of arrangement, experts warn, is a tendency to pay the wife more    1.67495327387791

2% sales tax within that area. Colorado has a 2% sales    1.6065767145351917

that the state's occupation tax applied to sales, made at cost to an    1.67495327387791
oil company, by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain    1.6065767145351917
supplies without divulging the identity of the parent. The state's    1.5636360329510388
occupation tax is computed on gross sales. The court held that the tax    1.67495327387791

benefits by doing business as two separate entities.    1.4513752902486308
_WASHINGTON_- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising    1.5127085093302464
for two consecutive months, the Government reported.   The Commerce    1.5127085093302464
Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped    1.5127085093302464
to slightly under $18 billion in April, down 1% from the March    1.6432600607208703
level of more than $18.2 billion. April sales also were 5% below    1.6432600607208703
those of April last year, when volume reached a record for any month,    1.67495327387791
$18.9 billion (see chart on Page One).   The seasonal adjustment    1.5636360329510388
takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this    1.6432600607208703
year, two weeks earlier than in 1960, and pre-Easter buying was pushed    1.6432600607208703
into March.   Commerce Department officials were inclined to    1.4513752902486308
explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer    1.67495327387791
buying in March. Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively    1.6065767145351917
steep 2.5% from those of the month before, which in turn were slightly    1.67495327387791

member of a Texas Tech class on food. The pretty coeds must have ogled    1.7026049541338664
him all day long- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.   1.67495327387791
Last October he gave a public speech in Washington, D&C&    1.5636360329510388
entitled "Are Women Here to Stay"? So you can see that Gerald    1.6432600607208703
G& Ramsey, director of ~SMU's food services, is not the    1.5636360329510388
ordinary type of craven, women-trodden chef. He is apt to rear back    1.6432600607208703
{RAMSEY}, as ~SMU's food    1.0
wrangler, buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week. Tell    1.6065767145351917
that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden!   1.6432600607208703
He also dishes up 3,000 snacks. And he operates three cafeterias    1.6065767145351917
in the Student Center, along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the    1.6065767145351917
athlete's tables.   Ramsey, 6-3, 195 and ruggedly slim, says,    1.5127085093302464
"I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me    1.6432600607208703
{HE WAS IN CHARGE} of the Hockaday School    1.4513752902486308
meals from 1946 to 1950, before he moved to ~SMU. And you'll    1.6432600607208703
notice that in both places, there are acres of charming young ladies    1.6432600607208703
who with little effort spice up any chow line.   What does he feed    1.67495327387791
his ~SMU football mastodons at the training table?   "Mostly    1.5127085093302464
meat and potatoes- they have to have that go-go-go without    1.5636360329510388
getting too fat", says Ramsey. So he hides the mayonnaise. And to    1.6432600607208703
keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress,    1.5127085093302464
{WHAT DO} the    1.0
pretty ~SMU girls like on their plates?   "Pretty much    1.5127085093302464
hamburger, hotdogs, steak and, at night, maybe pizza", says the handsome    1.6065767145351917
food expert. "Unfortunately, there is still little demand for    1.5127085093302464
broccoli and cauliflower".   Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman,    1.5127085093302464
Henry Cabot Lodge, the King of Morocco, Clement Atlee and    1.5636360329510388
other shiny characters. Once four Tibetan monks, in their saffron robes,    1.6065767145351917
filed through the cafeteria line.   "They aren't supposed    1.4513752902486308
to look at women, you know", Ramsey recalled. "What with all    1.6065767145351917
those pretty girls around, they had a hard time".    1.5127085093302464
Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest. Salt and pepper    1.6065767145351917
each breast. Dip in melted butter and roll in flour. Place side by    1.67495327387791
side in a 2-inch deep baking pan. Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275    1.7026049541338664
F& until lightly brown.   Add enough warmed cream, seasoned    1.5127085093302464
to taste with onion juice, to about half cover the chicken breasts.    1.6432600607208703
Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer.   While this is baking,    1.6065767145351917
saute mushrooms, fresh or canned, in butter. Sprinkle over top    1.5636360329510388
of chicken breasts. Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham    1.67495327387791
and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.   (Leave off the    1.5127085093302464
ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac, says Ramsey.)   1.5127085093302464
Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line    1.4513752902486308
modern but has sculptured pattern, many design facets, warmth, dignity    1.5636360329510388
and an effect of utter comfort and livability.   That is the    1.6065767145351917
goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month.   1.6065767145351917
Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary    1.5636360329510388
furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's,    1.67495327387791
two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated,    1.5636360329510388
but warm look in contemporary. These two, Heritage and Drexel,    1.5636360329510388
chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece,    1.6432600607208703
but a collection of correlated designs, each of which could stand alone.   1.6432600607208703
The Heritage collection, to be shown by Sanger-Harris and    1.5127085093302464
Anderson's Studio, has perhaps more different types of woods and    1.5636360329510388
decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one    1.5636360329510388
time. Called Perennian, to indicate its lasting, good today and tomorrow    1.6065767145351917
quality, the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces.   1.5636360329510388
Walnut, wormy chestnut, pecan, three varieties of burl,    1.4513752902486308
hand-woven Philippine cane, ceramic tiles, marble are used to emphasize    1.5636360329510388
the feeling of texture and of permanence, the furniture to fit into    1.6432600607208703
rooms with tiled floors, brick or paneled walls, windows that bring    1.6065767145351917
in the outdoors. It is a collection with a custom-design look, offering    1.6432600607208703
simplicity with warmth, variety and vitality.   The Drexel collection,    1.5127085093302464
called Composite, to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic    1.5636360329510388
approach to decorating, a mature modern that is a variation of many    1.6432600607208703
designs.   Rounded posts give a soft, sculptured look, paneled    1.5127085093302464
doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches,    1.6065767145351917
table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia. A high-legged    1.6065767145351917
buffet provides easy-to-reach serving, a cocktail table has small snack    1.5636360329510388
tables tucked under each end, recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch    1.6065767145351917
long chest.   An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented,    1.5636360329510388
with a young, basic, functional group of chests, dressers and    1.5636360329510388
corner units and a canted headboard. The other bedroom has heavier styling,    1.6432600607208703
door-fronted dressers with acacia panels, a poster bed or a bed    1.6065767145351917
with arched acacia panels and matching mirror.   Colorful, bright    1.5127085093302464
Eastman Chromspun fabrics, with the magenta, pink and white tones    1.5636360329510388
predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite. The    1.6065767145351917
fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles.    1.5127085093302464
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite    1.6065767145351917
contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group, Composite.    1.4513752902486308
The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony, to    1.6432600607208703
set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top. See-through design of    1.6432600607208703
the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji    1.6432600607208703
flavor. To bring warmth to the dining area, golden orange tones    1.6065767145351917
are used in the fabrics.   Dignity and comfort, in a contemporary    1.6065767145351917
manner, reflecting the best aspects of today's design, with substance    1.5636360329510388

bookcases. Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper    1.5127085093302464
and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander    1.6065767145351917

The Vagabonds are "on the road" again. Members are on their    1.6065767145351917
way to Saledo, not by stage coach, but in air-conditioned cars.   1.6065767145351917
This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn    1.5636360329510388
and adjoining country club, Saledo, for festivities. Invitations    1.4513752902486308
have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov& and    1.5636360329510388
Mrs& Price Daniel.   Stagecoach Days is the theme for the    1.5636360329510388

75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto "Go Somewhere, Anywhere,    1.6065767145351917
Everywhere". Their activities will be climaxed in the spring    1.5127085093302464
of 1962 when they go to Europe.   In the past, the men and women    1.7026049541338664
have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica, buses to Mineral    1.6065767145351917
Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and    1.5636360329510388
Galveston.   Four parties are given a year. Two of these are    1.6065767145351917
in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.   Serving    1.6432600607208703
on the club's board are ~Mmes R& P& Anderson, president;    1.5636360329510388

A cooky with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000    1.5636360329510388
for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off    1.5636360329510388
Tuesday.   Mrs& Alice H& Reese, wife of an engineer and    1.5636360329510388
mother of a 23-year-old son, was awarded the top prize at a luncheon    1.67495327387791
in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Mrs& Reese entered 10 past bake-offs    1.6065767145351917
before she got into the finals.   Second grand prize    1.5127085093302464
of $5,000 went to Mrs& Clara L& Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee    1.6432600607208703
ring, a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze.    1.6065767145351917
Mrs& Oliver is mother of five children and wife    1.5127085093302464
of a machinist. She lives in Wellsville, Mo&.   Mrs& Reese    1.5636360329510388
baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals.    1.6432600607208703
And the third time was the charm.   She dreamed up the cooky recipe,    1.67495327387791
tried it, liked it and entered it in the contest. The second baking    1.67495327387791
was for photographing when told she was a finalist. The third time    1.6432600607208703
was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical    1.67495327387791
eyes and tongues of judges.   1.1606783668269585
Mr& and Mrs& Joseph R& Bolker will give a dinner    1.5636360329510388
on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs& Norman Chandler,    1.67495327387791
chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee, and    1.5127085093302464
Mr& Chandler.   Mr& Bolker heads a group within the building    1.5636360329510388
and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural    1.6065767145351917
center for the performing arts.   A feature of the party will    1.6065767145351917
be a presentation by Welton Becket, center architect, of color slides    1.6065767145351917
and renderings of the three-building complex.    1.2818970554302986
Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los    1.3761581156320553

More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in    1.67495327387791
the spring.   Among those with reservations are Messrs& and    1.5127085093302464
Mmes& William A& Thompson, Van Cott Niven, A& B& Cox,    1.5636360329510388
David Bricker, Samuel Perry and Robert D& Stetson.    1.4513752902486308
Others are Drs& and Mmes& Alfred Robbins, and J& Lafe Ludwig    1.6065767145351917

When Dr& W& A& Swim celebrated his    1.3761581156320553
75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club, guests came by chartered    1.6065767145351917
plane from all over the country.   A flight originating in    1.5636360329510388
Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane    1.67495327387791
left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points.   1.5636360329510388
Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons    1.6432600607208703
who had known Dr& Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles. He started    1.67495327387791
practice in 1917, and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners.   1.6432600607208703
Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg,    1.6432600607208703
a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would    1.5127085093302464
have a promising career on the concert stage.   A heart attack    1.6065767145351917
when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing.    1.67495327387791
She put the violin away and took out some linen, needles and yarn to    1.7026049541338664
while away the long, idle days in Budapest.   Now her modern tapestries    1.6432600607208703
have been exhibited on two continents and, at 26, she feels she    1.6432600607208703
is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles.   Her    1.67495327387791
days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden    1.7026049541338664
end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband    1.6432600607208703
Stephen fled to Vienna.   There they continued their studies    1.5127085093302464
at the university, she in art, he in architecture. And there she had    1.67495327387791
her first showing of tapestry work.   1.2818970554302986
There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America    1.6432600607208703
today. What most people don't seem to realize, if they aren't    1.6065767145351917
tied up with the thing as I am, is that 90% of the problem is transportation.   1.748515906000203
I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved    1.4513752902486308
until, at long last, both of my boys got squeezed into high school.    1.67495327387791
It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the    1.7026049541338664
hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint    1.7026049541338664
at the grammar school.   Getting to and from school was no    1.6065767145351917
Now they go to    1.0
a high school that is two miles away. One might think the problem would    1.7026049541338664
be similar. They could walk, ride on a bus or be driven.    1.6432600607208703
It's much more complex than that. Generally, they go to school with    1.6432600607208703
a girl named Gloriana, who lives down the block, and has a car.   1.67495327387791
This is a way of getting to school, but, I understand, it entails    1.67495327387791
a certain loss of social status. A young man doesn't like to be driven    1.7026049541338664
up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even    1.748515906000203
in a higher class than he is, and is also a girl.   "Why don't    1.7026049541338664
you walk to school then"? I suggested. "My father walked,    1.5636360329510388
through two miles of snow, in Illinois".   "Did you"?    1.5127085093302464
I was asked.   "No", I said, "I didn't happen to grow    1.6065767145351917
up in Illinois".   I explained, however, that I had my share    1.6065767145351917
I had to ride a streetcar two miles. Sometimes the streetcar    1.6065767145351917
was late. Sometimes there weren't even any seats. I had to stand    1.6432600607208703
up, with the ladies. Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get    1.7026049541338664
to school at all, but wound up at the ocean, or some other dismal place,    1.7269387314284994
and had to spend the day there.   I've tried to compromise    1.6065767145351917
by letting them take the little car now and then. When they do that    1.7026049541338664
my wife has to drive me to work in the big car. She has to have at    1.7677783654484436
least one car herself. I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven    1.7269387314284994
up in front of work in a car driven by my wife, who is only a woman.   1.7677783654484436
Even that isn't satisfactory. If they have to take any car,    1.6065767145351917
they'd rather take the big one. They say that when they take a    1.67495327387791
car, Gloriana doesn't take her car, but rides with them. But when    1.6432600607208703
Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually    1.7026049541338664
The    1.0
logic of that is impeccable, of course, except that I feel like a    1.67495327387791
fool being driven up to work in a little car, by my wife, when everybody    1.7269387314284994
knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself.   The    1.67495327387791
solution, naturally, is the bus. However, it's a half-mile walk    1.5636360329510388
down a steep hill from our house to the bus, and it's too hard on my    1.748515906000203

HERE'S an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute    1.6432600607208703
and is completely charming, using puppets for lamp bases. Most children    1.6065767145351917
love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies, and    1.5636360329510388
they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action, rather than    1.7026049541338664
put away in boxes. Displayed as lamps, the puppets delight the children    1.6432600607208703
and are decorative accent.   To create such a lamp, order    1.5636360329510388
a wired pedestal from any lamp shop. Measure the puppet to determine    1.6432600607208703
the height of the light socket, allowing three to four inches above the    1.67495327387791
puppet's head. Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire    1.6432600607208703
passes is in the shape of an inverted "~L", the foot of the    1.67495327387791
"~L" about three inches long, so that the puppet can hang directly    1.6432600607208703
under the light.    1.0
Using the strings that manipulate    1.1606783668269585
the puppet, suspend him from the light fixture by tying the    1.6065767145351917
strings to the lamp base. In this way, you can arrange his legs and arms    1.7269387314284994
in any desired position, with feet, or one foot, barely resting on    1.6432600607208703
the pedestal. If the puppets are of uniform size, you can change them    1.67495327387791
in accord with your child's whims.   Although a straight drum    1.5636360329510388
shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could    1.6065767145351917
be changed without disharmony, it is far more fun to create shades    1.6432600607208703
in the gay spirit of a child's playtime. Those illustrated are reminiscent    1.6432600607208703
of a circus top or a merry-go-round. The scalloped edge is particularly    1.6432600607208703
appealing.   1.0
TODAY'S trend toward furniture designs from America's    1.3761581156320553
past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the    1.6065767145351917
shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era.   A generation ago    1.5127085093302464
there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions.    1.6065767145351917
In the background lurked the feeling, however, that these pieces,    1.5636360329510388
beautiful as they were, lacked the utilitarian touch. So junior's    1.5636360329510388
bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy, nondescript pieces that    1.5636360329510388
supposedly could take the "hard knocks", while the fine secretary    1.5636360329510388
was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only.   This    1.6432600607208703
isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's, according to decorator    1.6432600607208703
consultant, Leland Alden.   Housewives are finding literally    1.3761581156320553
hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs,    1.6432600607208703
says Mr& Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial    1.6065767145351917
craftsmen had "an innate sense of the practical".    1.4513752902486308
There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century    1.5636360329510388
designer had to develop "down to earth" designs- or go out of    1.6432600607208703

Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's    1.5636360329510388
growing threat on our doorstep and around the world?    1.5127085093302464
More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more    1.67495327387791

got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the    1.6432600607208703

schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church.   1.6432600607208703
{And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn    1.6432600607208703
about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote-    1.6432600607208703
a Biblically strong Christianity}.   So the Christian    1.3761581156320553
Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers    1.6065767145351917
and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat    1.6065767145351917
enthralled at the four-hour program.   This Sunday those attending    1.5127085093302464
the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation;    1.67495327387791

Response to the program has been so encouraging, Kern    1.5127085093302464
said, that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be    1.6432600607208703
set up soon.   And to encourage other churches to try their own    1.6432600607208703
programs, Kern said this Sunday's sessions- including the free    1.5127085093302464
dinner- will be open to anyone who makes reservations.   1.5127085093302464

stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week    1.5127085093302464
in Miami area churches next week.   Of particular meaning to    1.5636360329510388

taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies.   1.6065767145351917
The first one, two years ago, changed the routine of their    1.6065767145351917
home life.   {"When you stand up in public and take vows to    1.6432600607208703
strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the    1.67495327387791
fundamentals of the Christian faith, you strive a little harder to uphold    1.6432600607208703
those vows", explains the slender vice president of the young couples    1.6065767145351917
Sunday school class}.   Until that first dedication service,    1.4513752902486308
he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in    1.67495327387791
any religious life at home. They have five daughters- Coral Lee,    1.6065767145351917
5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and Shari, five months.   1.6432600607208703
But after that service, they decided to try to let the girls say    1.67495327387791
grace at the table, have bedtime prayers, and Bible stories. To their    1.6432600607208703
surprise, the children all were eager and quite able to take part.    1.6432600607208703

The Leningrad Kirov Ballet, which opened a series of performances    1.5636360329510388
Friday night at the Opera House, is, I think, the finest "classical"    1.6432600607208703
ballet company I have ever seen, and the production of    1.5636360329510388
the Petipa-Tschaikowsky "Sleeping Beauty" with which it began    1.4513752902486308
the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of    1.67495327387791
witnessing.   This work is no favorite of mine. I am prepared    1.6065767145351917
to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial    1.6432600607208703
Russia in its most vulgar, infantile, and reactionary aspect; that    1.5636360329510388
its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates    1.6065767145351917
that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was;    1.7026049541338664
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot    1.6432600607208703
to boobify the American people; that its choreography is undistinguished    1.5636360329510388
and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms. All    1.5127085093302464
of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of    1.7269387314284994
the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation.    1.1606783668269585
The reasons    1.0
for this enchantment are numerous, but most of them end in "ova",    1.6432600607208703
"eva", or "aya". In other words, no merely male creature    1.5636360329510388
can resist that corps de ballet. It seems to have been chosen exclusively    1.67495327387791
from the winners of beauty contests- Miss Omsk, Miss Pinsk,    1.5636360329510388
Miss Stalingr **h oops, skip it.   These qualities alone,    1.5127085093302464
however, would not account for their success, and it took me a while to    1.7026049541338664
discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective    1.5127085093302464
personality. It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address    1.6065767145351917
toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to    1.67495327387791
the American ballet. Oh-the-pain-of-it, that convention of Russian    1.4513752902486308
ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters    1.67495327387791
of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to thestage out of filial piety,    1.6065767145351917
is totally absent from the Kirov. This is all the more remarkable    1.6432600607208703
because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American    1.6432600607208703
politics. But, obviously, at least some things have changed for    1.5636360329510388
the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned.   Irina    1.6432600607208703
Kolpakova, the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance, would    1.4513752902486308
be a change for the better anywhere, at any time, no matter who had had    1.7269387314284994
the role before. She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes    1.67495327387791
on, and her dancing has a feminine suavity, lightness, sparkle, and refinement    1.6432600607208703
which are simply incomparable.    1.0
Alla Sizova, who    1.0
seems to have made a special hit in the East, was delightful as the lady    1.7269387314284994
Bluebird and her partner, Yuri Soloviev, was wonderfully    1.4513752902486308
virile,    1.0
acrobatic, and poetic all at the same time, in a tradition not unlike    1.67495327387791
that of Nijinsky. Vladilen Semenov, a fine "danseur noble";    1.5127085093302464
Konstantin Shatilov, a great character dancer; and Inna Zubkovskaya,    1.5127085093302464
an excellent Lilac Fairy, were other outstanding members of the    1.5636360329510388
cast, but every member of the cast was magnificent.   The production,    1.6065767145351917
designed by Simon Virsaladze, was completely traditional but    1.4513752902486308
traditional in the right way. It was done with great taste, was big and    1.7026049541338664
spacious, sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes,    1.6432600607208703
but sumptuous in a muted, pastel-like style, with rich, quiet harmonies    1.6065767145351917
of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes    1.5636360329510388
and the scenery.   Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally    1.4513752902486308
large orchestra, one containing excellent soloists- the violin    1.4513752902486308
solos by the concertmaster, Guy Lumia, were especially fine- but one    1.6065767145351917
in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally    1.7026049541338664
had not had time to achieve much unity.   1.4513752902486308

FOR A GOOD MANY SEASONS I've been looking at the naughty    1.6065767145351917
stuff on television, so the other night I thought I ought to see    1.67495327387791
how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies. After    1.7026049541338664
all, this year's movies are next year's television shows.   1.5127085093302464
So I went to see "La Dolce Vita".   <It has been billed    1.6432600607208703
as a towering monument to immorality. All the sins of ancient Rome    1.6432600607208703
are said to be collected into this three-hour film. If that's    1.6065767145351917
all the Romans did, it's a surprise to me that Rome fell>.    1.6432600607208703
After television, "La Dolce Vita" seems as harmless as a Gray    1.6065767145351917
Line tour of North Beach at night. I cannot imagine a single scene    1.67495327387791
that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on ~TV every week.   1.6432600607208703
I believe ~TV watchers will be bored.   <"La Dolce    1.5127085093302464
Vita" has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average    1.6432600607208703
~TV Western. Week in, week out, there is more sex to be seen    1.67495327387791
in "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet". There is more decadence    1.6065767145351917
on "77 Sunset Strip". There are more obvious nymphomaniacs    1.5127085093302464
{IN ANOTHER RESPECT},    1.0
television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors    1.6432600607208703
are unknowns. With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg,    1.6065767145351917
the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge    1.6432600607208703
Theater.   Most of the emphasis has been placed on a "wild    1.6065767145351917
party" at a seaside villa. Producer Fellini should have looked at    1.6065767145351917
some of the old silent films where they really had {PARTIES}!    1.6065767145351917
The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease (carried as    1.5636360329510388
far as a black slip); a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries    1.7269387314284994
the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her    1.67495327387791
face; a frigid beauty, and three silly fairies.   Put them all    1.6065767145351917
together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of:    1.67495327387791
dull.   <Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties    1.5127085093302464
had begun to pall. What a swinging group they must have been when    1.67495327387791
{AS A MORAL SHOCKER}    1.0
it is a dud. But this doesn't detract from its merit as an    1.67495327387791
interesting, if not great, film. The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker    1.5127085093302464
summed it up neatly:   "This is a long picture and a controversial    1.6432600607208703
one, but basically it is a moral, enthralling and heartbreaking    1.5636360329510388
description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps    1.6065767145351917
Rome has from her traditional political, cultural and religious    1.5127085093302464
glories".   <And when they sell it to television in a couple    1.6065767145351917

THE WEEK WENT along briskly enough. I bought a new little    1.6065767145351917
foreign bomb. It is a British bomb. Very austere yet racy.   1.6065767145351917
It is very chic to drive foreign cars. With a foreign car you must    1.7026049541338664
wear a cap- it has a leather band in the back. You must also wear    1.7269387314284994
a car coat.   The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive.    1.67495327387791
"WHERE    1.0
DO YOU put the lighter fluid, ha, ha"? asked the gas station    1.6432600607208703
man. The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor.   1.6065767145351917
Gas station people are very debonair about small cars.    1.5127085093302464
When I drove a car with tail fins, I had plenty status at the wind-and-water    1.7269387314284994
oases. My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth.   1.6065767145351917
This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.   When    1.4513752902486308
I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome, the    1.7026049541338664
gas people were happy to see me.   "<Tires> OK? <Check    1.5636360329510388
the oil and water, sir?>"   They polished the windshield.    1.5127085093302464
THE MAN STUCK the nozzle    1.1606783668269585
in the gas tank. "What kind of car is it"? he asked gloomily.   1.67495327387791
"It is a British Austin, the smallest they make".    1.5127085093302464
"Get much mileage"?   "About 35".   The gas station    1.4513752902486308
man sighed unhappily.   "What I always say is what if    1.5636360329510388
somebody clobbers you in a little car like that? Crunch, that's all    1.6432600607208703
she wrote".   "I will die rich".   "That will be    1.5127085093302464
$1.80", said the gas station man. "The windshield looks pretty    1.5636360329510388
AH, THE FAIR-WEATHER friends of yesteryear!    1.2818970554302986
When I wheeled about, finned fore and aft, I was the darling of the    1.7026049541338664
doormen. Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps    1.6432600607208703
politely.   With a small bomb, I tuck it between Cadillacs.    1.5636360329510388
(The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself. High    1.6432600607208703
blood pressure can get the best of any of us.)   1.5636360329510388
AT LAST the White House is going to get some much-copied    1.6065767145351917
furniture by that master American craftsman, Duncan Phyfe, whose    1.5127085093302464
designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U& S& Presidents    1.6065767145351917
of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings.   The American    1.6065767145351917
Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of    1.5636360329510388
sofas    1.0
and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library.    1.6432600607208703
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's.    1.6432600607208703
The gift is being presented by "heirs and descendants of the Rutherford    1.6432600607208703
family of New Jersey, whose famous estate,    1.3761581156320553
"Tranquility",    1.0
was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover, N& J&.   1.6065767145351917
Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon,    1.4513752902486308
although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned    1.5127085093302464
after the style trends he set 150 years ago. This acquisition is    1.6432600607208703
a    1.0
matched, perfect set- consisting of two sofas six feet long, plus six    1.6432600607208703
sidechairs and two armchairs.   THE ~AID HAS undertaken    1.4513752902486308
the redecoration of the White House library as a project in    1.6065767145351917
connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's    1.6065767145351917
Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential    1.5636360329510388
home. It is the ~AID's intention to create in the    1.5636360329510388
library "a miniature museum of Americana" before completed refurbishing    1.5127085093302464
is unveiled early this fall.   The room will also feature    1.5636360329510388
another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the    1.5636360329510388
Duncan Phyfe furniture. The ~AID has found a mantlepiece attributed    1.5636360329510388
to Samuel McIntyre of Salem, Mass&, an architect and woodcarver    1.5636360329510388
who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792.   1.6065767145351917
The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and    1.6065767145351917
is being fitted over the White House library fireplace. It will be    1.6432600607208703
painted to match the paneling in the room.   The ~AID committee's    1.6065767145351917
chairman in charge of the redecoration, Mrs& Henry Francis    1.5127085093302464
Lenygon, was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff    1.6065767145351917
members on the project. Mrs& Lenygon's committee associates,    1.4513752902486308
announced formally yesterday by the ~AID in New York, include Mrs&    1.6065767145351917
Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J& Jussel, both wellknown    1.5127085093302464
Manhattan decorators. Regional representatives appointed to serve    1.3761581156320553
from each section of the country include Frank E& Barnes of    1.6065767145351917

PRESIDENT KENNEDY couldn't stay away from his desk for    1.5127085093302464
the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn    1.6065767145351917
yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard,    1.5127085093302464
N& C&. But he left the doors to his office open so he    1.67495327387791
could hear the music.   At 4 p& m& the President left the White    1.67495327387791
House to welcome the young musicians, students from the ages of    1.6065767145351917
12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp,    1.7026049541338664
and to greet the 325 crippled, cardiac and blind children from the    1.6432600607208703
District area who were special guests at the concert.   It was    1.6065767145351917
the first in the series of "Concerts for Young People by Young    1.6432600607208703
People" to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the    1.6065767145351917
White House. She was not present yesterday, however, to enjoy the    1.6065767145351917
music or watch the faces of the delighted audience.   She is vacationing    1.6432600607208703
at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port, Mass&, and in    1.6065767145351917
his welcoming remarks, the President said he was representing her.   1.5636360329510388
As he approached the open bandstand, erected facing the South    1.5636360329510388
entrance to the Executive Mansion, the band struck up the "Star Spangled    1.6432600607208703
Banner" and followed it with "Hail to the Chief".   1.5127085093302464
"I think they played Hail to the Chief better than the Marine    1.6432600607208703
Corps Band, and we are grateful to them", President Kennedy remarked    1.6065767145351917
after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor    1.5127085093302464
James Christian Pfohl.   AFTER PAYING tribute to the conductor    1.5127085093302464
and his white-clad youthful students, President Kennedy said,    1.4513752902486308
"As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that    1.67495327387791
is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States-    1.6432600607208703
schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested    1.4513752902486308
young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music".   1.7026049541338664
He added "**h I think that sometimes in this country    1.5636360329510388
we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that    1.67495327387791
is being done in this field".   Displaying his knowledge of    1.5636360329510388
music, the New England-born President remarked that "probably the    1.5127085093302464
best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans-    1.67495327387791
and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary    1.5636360329510388
musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated all across    1.6065767145351917
the United States.   "This is a great national cultural asset,    1.5636360329510388
and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing    1.6432600607208703
as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today at the    1.7269387314284994
White House".   As he left the bandstand to return to his office,    1.6432600607208703
the slender, sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to    1.5636360329510388
shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming    1.6432600607208703
the first row under the field tent set up for the guests.   He    1.67495327387791
expressed surprise to learn that pretty, blonde Patricia Holbrook, 16,    1.5636360329510388
of Mount Rainier,    1.0
had attended the Joseph P& Kennedy School    1.3761581156320553
for the Handicapped in Boston. "The nuns there do a wonderful work",    1.6432600607208703
the President commented. Patricia now attends the C& Melvin    1.5127085093302464
Sharpe Health School in the District.   Each of the children    1.5636360329510388
invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red, white and    1.7026049541338664
blue ribbon. They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during    1.6065767145351917
the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White    1.6432600607208703
House staff.   MANY of the music-loving members of the President's    1.5636360329510388
staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the    1.5127085093302464
rapt attention given by the young seated audience. And it turned out    1.6432600607208703
to be more of a family affair than expected. Henry Hall Wilson, a    1.67495327387791
student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's    1.67495327387791
staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives, turned    1.5636360329510388
guest conductor for a Sousa march, the "Stars and Stripes Forever".   1.6065767145351917
Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs&    1.4513752902486308
Kennedy's Social Secretary, Letitia Baldrige, told about    1.3761581156320553
plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony    1.5636360329510388
Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring.   He said he contacted    1.5636360329510388
a friend, Henry Hall Wilson, on the President's staff and    1.5636360329510388
asked whether his orchestra could play, in the series. A flow of correspondence    1.67495327387791
between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation    1.5127085093302464
to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert.   1.6065767145351917
ONE OF THE MOST interested "students" on the tour which    1.5636360329510388
the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following    1.5636360329510388
their concert at the White House, was Letitia Baldrige, social    1.5636360329510388
secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.   "I was an art    1.5636360329510388
major in college", Miss Baldrige explained. "I've been here    1.5127085093302464
so many times I couldn't count them". She turned out to be a fan,    1.7026049541338664
too, of Margaret Bouton, the Gallery's associate curator of education.   1.5636360329510388
Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went    1.6065767145351917
on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5    1.5636360329510388
p& m&.    1.0
The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p& m&, remaining    1.7026049541338664
for about 45 minutes.   The Brevard visitors had very little    1.5636360329510388
to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later. They decided    1.7026049541338664
that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look "sad"**h    1.5127085093302464
they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's    1.5127085093302464
"Alba Madonna" and "texture" in a Monet painting of Rheims    1.5636360329510388
Cathedral. Everybody had heard of Van Gogh, the French impressionist.   1.5636360329510388
Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group, standing    1.4513752902486308
on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them.    1.67495327387791
He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery "is    1.6432600607208703
the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director    1.6432600607208703
**h Richard Bales **h I'm sure you've heard af him **h and his    1.67495327387791
record, 'The Confederacy'".   Along with the gallery aide    1.4513752902486308
who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group, went    1.6065767145351917
one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.   In 45 minutes,    1.5127085093302464
the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art    1.6432600607208703
from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century.   A few of them    1.6432600607208703
said they "preferred contemporary art".   Among the other    1.4513752902486308
artists, whose paintings were discussed were Boucher, Courbet, Fra    1.5127085093302464
Angelico.   The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most    1.6065767145351917
was the Gallery's rotunda fountain **h "because it's on the    1.5636360329510388
second floor".   1.0
That imposing, somewhat austere, and seemingly remote collonaded    1.4513752902486308
building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st&    1.6432600607208703
nw& took on bustling life yesterday.   More than 250 Scottish    1.5636360329510388
Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple    1.6065767145351917
to pay tribute to their most prominent leader, Albert Pike, who headed    1.6432600607208703
the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.   They came together in    1.6065767145351917
the huge, high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized.    1.6065767145351917
C& Wheeler Barnes of Denver, head of the Scottish Rite    1.5636360329510388
in Colorado, praised Pike as a historian, author, poet, journalist,    1.5636360329510388
lawyer, jurist, soldier and musician, who devoted most of his mature    1.6065767145351917
years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order.   The ceremony    1.5636360329510388
ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House    1.7269387314284994
of the Temple. A reception and tea followed.   About 1500    1.5636360329510388
delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the    1.6432600607208703
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction    1.5127085093302464
of the United States.   The opening session of the 5-day session    1.6065767145351917
will begin at 10 a& m& today. There will be a pilgrimage to    1.67495327387791
Mount Vernon at 2:30 p& m&. A wreath will be placed at the    1.67495327387791
tomb of George Washington, one of this Nation's first Masons-    1.5636360329510388
a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria.   1.5127085093302464
THE MARRIAGE of John and Mary Black had clearly reached    1.5636360329510388
the breaking point after eight years.   John had a job in a small    1.67495327387791
firm where the work was dull and monotonous. He would come home in    1.67495327387791
the evening tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play with    1.67495327387791
their three children, or spend much time chatting with his wife.   1.6065767145351917
Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary complained often    1.6065767145351917
that he didn't help around the house, and that he didn't really    1.6432600607208703
care about the family. She accused him of ignoring her. He in turn told    1.7026049541338664
her she demanded too much. They were both discouraged, disgusted    1.5636360329510388
and miserable.   Mary decided she had had enough. Without any definite    1.6065767145351917
plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could be done. The    1.7269387314284994
judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations-    1.6065767145351917
then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from    1.5636360329510388
Family    1.0
Service before going to a lawyer.   Family Service, sharing    1.5127085093302464
in ~UGF, has five agencies in the Washington area. They offer    1.6065767145351917
to the people of this community case work service and counseling on    1.6432600607208703
a wide variety of family problems.   Because neither of them really    1.6065767145351917
wanted their marriage to break up, Mr& and Mrs& Black agreed    1.6065767145351917
to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia,    1.6065767145351917
the agency nearest them. For nearly a year, they have been receiving    1.6432600607208703
counseling, separately and together, in an effort to understand and    1.5636360329510388
overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce.    1.6432600607208703
The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of    1.6432600607208703
the problems confronting the other. They are now working together toward    1.6065767145351917
solving their difficulties.   JOHN received a promotion    1.3761581156320553
in his firm. He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on    1.7026049541338664
life. Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings,    1.7026049541338664
and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session    1.5636360329510388
of happy, family rough-housing.   To outsiders, the Blacks seem    1.5127085093302464
to be an ordinary, happy family, and they are- but with a difference.    1.67495327387791
They know the value of being just that- an ordinary, happy family.   1.6432600607208703
Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this    1.5127085093302464
area. Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital. But    1.6432600607208703
to the families it serves, their help cannot be measured. Family Service    1.6432600607208703
could not open its doors to a single family without the financial    1.6432600607208703
support of the United Givers Fund.   1.2818970554302986
Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to    1.5127085093302464
materialize yesterday, park rangers said, and those who made the trip    1.6065767145351917
got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.    1.7026049541338664
One of the initial questions put to President    1.4513752902486308
Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his    1.6065767145351917
attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev. Mr& Kennedy    1.5127085093302464
replied:   @ "I'm hopeful that from @ more traditional    1.3761581156320553
exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground".   The    1.5127085093302464
President knew that a confrontation with Mr& Khrushchev sooner or    1.5636360329510388
later probably was inevitable and even desirable. But he was convinced    1.6065767145351917
that the realities of power- military, economic and ideological-    1.5127085093302464
were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that    1.6432600607208703
these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting. He    1.67495327387791
wanted to buy time to strengthen the U& S& and its allies and    1.67495327387791
to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.   Last Friday    1.6065767145351917
the White House announced:   President Kennedy will    1.3761581156320553
meet    1.0
with Soviet Premier Nikita S& Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and    1.6065767145351917
4.   The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration    1.5636360329510388
in East-West relations. The heightened tension, in fact, had been    1.5636360329510388
a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency    1.6432600607208703
of a meeting with the Soviet leader. He was not going to Vienna    1.67495327387791
to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow    1.5127085093302464
last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned. But    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.   1.5636360329510388
That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting.    1.6432600607208703
Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance    1.6065767145351917
of the meeting, it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters    1.7026049541338664
of the cold war. @    1.0
The U& S& and    1.0
Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston    1.6065767145351917
Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy    1.5636360329510388
with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace "at the    1.7026049541338664
summit of the nations".   The first time was in 1955 when a    1.6432600607208703
full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the "spirit of Geneva".    1.5636360329510388
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads    1.6432600607208703
into the Middle East.   In 1959 President Eisenhower    1.4513752902486308
and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U& S&.    1.6065767145351917
That meeting produced the "spirit of Camp David"- a spirit, it    1.6065767145351917
later turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress    1.5636360329510388
toward a Berlin settlement.   On the third occasion- another    1.5127085093302464
Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago- there was no problem    1.67495327387791
of an illusory "spirit". Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference    1.5127085093302464
at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U& S&    1.6432600607208703
for the ~U-2 incident. The episode tended to confirm the U&    1.6065767145351917
S& belief that propaganda, the hope of one-sided concessions, and    1.5636360329510388
the chance to split the Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were    1.6065767145351917
the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry.    1.3761581156320553
Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration    1.4513752902486308
that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President, Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem. Shortly before his    1.5636360329510388
nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations    1.67495327387791
with the Soviet leader in these words:   "As long    1.5127085093302464
as Mr& Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is    1.6432600607208703
shifting his way, no amount of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp    1.6432600607208703
David talks nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful    1.6065767145351917
negotiations".   1.0
The President had set for himself the task, which    1.5127085093302464
he believed vital, of awakening the U& S& and its allies to    1.6432600607208703
the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance. He did    1.6432600607208703
not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make    1.67495327387791
it unnecessary. He wanted time, too, to review the United States'    1.6065767145351917
global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited    1.6065767145351917
and new ones he was formulating. Above all, he did not want to appear    1.7026049541338664
to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep.    1.5636360329510388
At the same time the President took pains not to    1.5636360329510388
rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader. Ideally, he knew,    1.6432600607208703
it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels. But Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting, provided that undue    1.6065767145351917
hopes were not raised in connection with it. It would give him an    1.67495327387791
opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war,    1.67495327387791
to try to probe Mr& Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear    1.6065767145351917
his own views. Moreover, an eventual meeting was desirable if for no    1.6432600607208703
other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U& S& was not    1.67495327387791
inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.   1.5636360329510388
Both elements- the caution about a meeting, the willingness    1.5127085093302464
eventually to hold one- were reflected in a letter from the President    1.6432600607208703
which Ambassador Llewellyn E& Thompson brought back to Russia    1.5127085093302464
late in February. The letter, dated Feb& 22, was delivered to    1.6065767145351917
Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9. It dealt    1.5636360329510388
mainly with a broad range of East-West issues. But it also briefly    1.6432600607208703
suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr& Khrushchev before    1.5636360329510388
the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and    1.6432600607208703
schedules permitted.   Developments over the next two months, however,    1.5127085093302464
caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing.    1.5636360329510388
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House    1.6432600607208703
about the advisability of an early meeting, not because the international    1.6065767145351917
climate was improving, but precisely because it was deteriorating    1.5127085093302464
alarmingly.    1.0
The President was especially    1.0
concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at    1.6065767145351917
Geneva. The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand    1.6065767145351917
for a three-man (East, West and neutral) directorate, and thus a veto,    1.6432600607208703
over the control machinery. In the U& S&, strong pressures    1.5636360329510388
have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians    1.7026049541338664
may be secretly testing.   Mr& Kennedy was less troubled    1.5127085093302464
by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown,    1.6065767145351917
or even continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear    1.6065767145351917
weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.    1.7269387314284994
There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was    1.5127085093302464
also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly    1.5636360329510388
to Communist China. The question arose as to whether a frank discussion    1.6432600607208703
of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent. Moreover,    1.6432600607208703
Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle    1.5127085093302464
to the executive organs of all international bodies, including    1.5127085093302464
the U& N& Secretariat and the International Control Commission    1.5127085093302464
for Laos. Mr& Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand    1.6065767145351917
would make international agreements, or even negotiations, impossible.   1.4513752902486308
Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability    1.5127085093302464
of an early summit meeting. Initially the White House reaction    1.5636360329510388
was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict    1.6432600607208703
in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting. At the same time,    1.6432600607208703
there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader,    1.6432600607208703
as a result of those episodes, come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion    1.6432600607208703
about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist    1.5127085093302464
pressure.   In Cuba, the U& S& had blundered badly and    1.5636360329510388
created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even    1.5127085093302464
on its own doorstep. In Laos, the picture was almost equally bad.    1.6432600607208703
U& S& willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier    1.6432600607208703
Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be "neutralized"    1.5127085093302464
on Soviet terms. Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention    1.5636360329510388
in Laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed    1.5636360329510388
Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic    1.6432600607208703
moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces. As a result,    1.5636360329510388
the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva    1.6432600607208703
negotiations on Laos, and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast    1.6065767145351917
Asia are under increased pressure.   In the light of those    1.5636360329510388
events, there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev    1.6065767145351917
might overreach himself. Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow    1.4513752902486308
that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive. He has indicated    1.6432600607208703
that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out. The    1.67495327387791
President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn    1.67495327387791
Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such    1.5127085093302464
as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning    1.67495327387791
back.   It was in the midst of such White House deliberations    1.6065767145351917
that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the    1.6065767145351917
U& S& Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in    1.6432600607208703
the near future. Mr& Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer    1.6432600607208703
by May 20 after consultation with the Allies. The response from    1.6065767145351917
London, Paris and Bonn was favorable. Firm arrangements for the meeting    1.6065767145351917
in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and    1.6432600607208703
Washington last week. Apparently at the insistence of the U& S&,    1.6065767145351917
the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow    1.4513752902486308
last Friday emphasized the "informal" nature of the meeting. The    1.5636360329510388
Washington announcement said:   @ "The President and Chairman    1.3761581156320553
Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose    1.5636360329510388
of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems    1.5636360329510388
that involve the interest of many other countries. The meeting    1.5636360329510388
will, however, afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first    1.6065767145351917
personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the    1.6432600607208703
major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries".    1.5636360329510388
@    1.5636360329510388
The Vienna meeting will bring together a    1.3761581156320553
seasoned,    1.0
67-year-old veteran of the cold war who, in Mr& Kennedy's    1.5636360329510388
own words, is "shrewd, tough, vigorous, well-informed and confident",    1.5127085093302464
and a 44-year-old President (his birthday is May 29) with a    1.6065767145351917
demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international    1.5636360329510388
diplomacy. The announcement last week of the forthcoming    1.4513752902486308
encounter produced strong reactions in the U& S& of both approval    1.6065767145351917
and disapproval.   The approval did not arise from an expectation    1.5636360329510388
of far-reaching agreements at Vienna. The inclination was to accept    1.5636360329510388
the statement that there would be no formal negotiations. But those    1.6065767145351917
who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between    1.67495327387791
the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.    1.7026049541338664
Mr& Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about    1.6065767145351917
his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men. The feeling was    1.67495327387791
that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the    1.67495327387791
President and that plain talk by Mr& Kennedy would give him pause.   1.6432600607208703
Apart from the personal equation, another reason advanced    1.4513752902486308
in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U&S&    1.7026049541338664
appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit. Premier Khrushchev    1.6065767145351917
has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got    1.67495327387791
his summit meeting anyway. This time the initiative came, in part    1.6065767145351917
at least, from Washington.    1.0
There was also    1.0
the fact that by the time he meets Mr& Khrushchev, the President    1.6432600607208703
will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied    1.5636360329510388
leaders. Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader    1.67495327387791
of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.   Finally,    1.6065767145351917
there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's    1.67495327387791
making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test    1.6432600607208703
accord. There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings    1.6065767145351917
throughout the world. If tests are to be resumed, the argument went,    1.6432600607208703
it is vital that the U& S& make plain that the onus belongs to    1.7026049541338664
the Soviet Union.   Disapproval of the meeting was based largely    1.5636360329510388
on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse. After Cuba    1.6432600607208703
and Laos, it was argued, Mr& Khrushchev will interpret the President's    1.6065767145351917
consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness-    1.5636360329510388
perhaps even panic- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage    1.6432600607208703
he now believes he holds. Moreover, the President is meeting the    1.6065767145351917
Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided    1.6432600607208703
on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments. The    1.5636360329510388
question was raised, for example, as to what attitude the President    1.6065767145351917
would take if Mr& Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending    1.6065767145351917
from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.   1.3761581156320553
THERE ARE, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms of    1.5636360329510388
adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.    1.6065767145351917
Mollusks are a case in point. The shell, which served the strain    1.6432600607208703
so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended    1.6432600607208703
to cancel out the possibility of future development. Though this may    1.6065767145351917
or may not be good biology, it does aptly illustrate the strength and    1.67495327387791
the weakness of American Catholic higher education.   There can    1.5127085093302464
be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field    1.6065767145351917
of higher education is most impressive: our European brethren never    1.5636360329510388
cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.    1.7026049541338664
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades,    1.6065767145351917
rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.    1.5636360329510388
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement    1.67495327387791
stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which    1.5636360329510388
brought the parochial school system into existence.   There    1.4513752902486308
is, however, one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture.    1.6065767145351917
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect,    1.4513752902486308
we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school    1.67495327387791
to university. But the simple truth is that higher education has    1.6065767145351917
never really been an official American Catholic project; certainly    1.5127085093302464
not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school    1.6432600607208703
system has been a matter of official policy.   Official encouragement    1.5636360329510388
is one thing, but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan    1.6432600607208703
and parochial funds. American Catholics have responded generously    1.4513752902486308
to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to    1.5636360329510388
create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar    1.6065767145351917
fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning. They    1.5636360329510388
have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly    1.67495327387791
ever been made. Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this    1.5636360329510388
as their direct responsibility.   All of this may be understandable    1.5636360329510388
enough: it is, however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan    1.6065767145351917
authorities could have acted otherwise. Yet for better or for worse,    1.6065767145351917
the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do    1.6432600607208703
<not> owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to    1.6065767145351917
the initiative, resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious    1.4513752902486308
communities. Community <esprit de corps> has been the protective    1.5127085093302464
shell which has made the achievement possible.   To understand    1.5127085093302464
the past history- and the future potential- of American Catholic    1.5636360329510388
higher education, it is necessary to appreciate the special character    1.5636360329510388
of the <esprit d' corps> of the religious community. It is something    1.6432600607208703
more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and    1.6065767145351917
detachment. A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves    1.6065767145351917
a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found    1.5636360329510388
elsewhere. The fact that the group orientation and group identification    1.5636360329510388
are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs    1.5636360329510388
of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.    1.6065767145351917
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship,    1.5636360329510388
the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting    1.6065767145351917
edge of sacrifice and hardship.   American Catholic colleges    1.4513752902486308
and universities are, in a very real sense, the product of "private    1.6432600607208703
enterprise"- the "private enterprise" of religious communities.    1.3761581156320553
Had it not been for such private enterprise, diocesan authorities    1.5636360329510388
might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized    1.5636360329510388
by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious    1.5636360329510388
as paid employees. There is however no point in speculating about such    1.6432600607208703
a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of    1.6432600607208703
higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which    1.6432600607208703
produces the "family business". This "family-community" spirit    1.3761581156320553
IT IS this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American    1.6432600607208703
Catholic higher education, in particular the wasteful duplication    1.4513752902486308
apparent in some areas. I think for example of three women's colleges    1.6432600607208703
with pitifully small enrollments, clustered within a few miles of    1.5636360329510388
a major Catholic university, which is also co-educational. This is not    1.6065767145351917
an isolated example; this aspect of the total picture has been commented    1.6432600607208703
upon often enough. It would seem to represent <esprit de corps>    1.6065767145351917
run riot.   Apart, however, from the question of wasteful duplication,    1.5636360329510388
there is another aspect of the "family business" spirit    1.5127085093302464
in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny.    1.5127085093302464
For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have    1.67495327387791
been adequately met by collegiate institutions, which in temper and tone    1.6065767145351917
closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools, it would    1.5127085093302464
seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles    1.6432600607208703
the university in its "pursuit of excellence". At the earlier    1.5636360329510388
"pre-academic excellence" stage of Catholic education, the operation    1.4513752902486308
could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis. But with today's    1.6065767145351917
demand for professional qualifications and specialized training,    1.3761581156320553
THE PROBLEM    1.0
is not merely that more "outside teachers" are needed but    1.5636360329510388
that a different brand is called for. Commenting on the earlier stage,    1.6432600607208703
the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University    1.5636360329510388
Professors    1.0
(in a recent report on the question of faculty participation    1.5636360329510388
in administrative decision-making) noted that the term "teacher-employee"    1.4513752902486308
(as opposed to, e&g&, "maintenance employee") was    1.3761581156320553
a not inapt description. Today however, the "outsider" is likely    1.5636360329510388
to have professional qualifications of the highest order (otherwise    1.5127085093302464
the college would not be interested in hiring him) and to be acclimatized    1.67495327387791
to the democratic processes of the secular or state university. And    1.6065767145351917
while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene, the scholar    1.6432600607208703
will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second    1.6065767145351917
class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank    1.6432600607208703
or professional achievement.   In the above mentioned report of    1.5127085093302464
the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University    1.5636360329510388
Professors, the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges    1.6432600607208703
very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see    1.67495327387791
it: "Even with the best of intentions he (the President of the    1.6432600607208703
university) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to    1.5636360329510388
a group the membership of which, considered (as it must be by him) in    1.7026049541338664
individual terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying    1.5127085093302464
temperament, interests and capabilities. It is natural that he should    1.5636360329510388
turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization    1.7026049541338664
which actually owns the university and whose goals are, in    1.5636360329510388
their opinion, identified with its highest good and (to use that oft-repeated    1.6432600607208703
phrase) 'the attainment of excellence'".   The pattern    1.3761581156320553
here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame: it is simply    1.6432600607208703
that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution    1.6432600607208703
by "the organization which actually owns" it, becomes more obvious    1.5636360329510388
where there is a larger and more distinguished "outside" faculty.    1.5636360329510388
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report    1.5636360329510388
should refer to "the organization which actually owns the university":    1.5636360329510388
this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more    1.67495327387791
to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension. But    1.6065767145351917
in any case, one does not have to read very closely between the lines    1.7026049541338664
to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy    1.6432600607208703
one. "Outside" faculty members want to be considered partners in    1.5636360329510388
the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.   1.6432600607208703
There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with    1.6065767145351917
this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university.    1.6432600607208703
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber    1.67495327387791
personnel. Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession,    1.5636360329510388
much given to attending meetings and conferences. Expressions    1.4513752902486308
of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member    1.5636360329510388
has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype. In    1.5636360329510388
the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or    1.67495327387791
a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines    1.6432600607208703
to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions    1.7026049541338664
at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.   1.6065767145351917
To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should be realized    1.6065767145351917
that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security,    1.6065767145351917
that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does    1.67495327387791
in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service. Much has    1.6432600607208703
been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee    1.6065767145351917
firm tenure. This is a significant advance but its import should not    1.6432600607208703
be exaggerated. When a man invests a block of his years at a university    1.7026049541338664
without gaining the coveted promotion, not only is he faced with the    1.6432600607208703
problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in    1.6432600607208703
the market value of his services. A man does not make that kind of    1.7026049541338664
gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure    1.7026049541338664
JUST    1.0
AS IT is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new    1.6432600607208703
tenure practices, it is also possible to exaggerate the significance    1.5636360329510388
of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions.    1.6065767145351917
Adequate compensation is indispensable. Yet adequate compensation-    1.3761581156320553
and particularly <merely> adequate compensation is no substitute    1.4513752902486308
for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his    1.6432600607208703
earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place. Broadly    1.6432600607208703
speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible    1.5127085093302464
but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature    1.67495327387791
responsibility in the total work of the university. Religious who    1.5636360329510388
derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious    1.6065767145351917
community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate    1.5636360329510388
both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this    1.6065767145351917
identification.   There is no need here to spell out the conditions    1.6065767145351917
of creative teaching except to point out that, at the college    1.6065767145351917
level, the sense of community and of community responsibility is even    1.6065767145351917
more necessary than it is at other levels. The college teacher needs    1.6432600607208703
the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also    1.6065767145351917
needs to feel that such communication, even informal debates over the    1.6065767145351917
luncheon table, are a contribution to the total good of the institution.    1.6432600607208703
But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from    1.6432600607208703
the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.   1.6432600607208703
The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy    1.5127085093302464
between faculty members who are part of the "in-group" that owns and    1.6432600607208703
operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees, is,    1.6065767145351917
therefore, the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.    1.6065767145351917
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary    1.6065767145351917
and tenure. Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive    1.6432600607208703
resolution of the problem of ownership and control, there are nevertheless    1.6065767145351917
certain suggestions which seem to be in order.   The first    1.5636360329510388
is a negative warning: there is no point in the creation of faculty    1.67495327387791
committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real    1.5636360329510388
authority. In the case of academic personnel the "feeling" of    1.5636360329510388
participation can hardly be "faked". Competent teachers are well    1.5127085093302464
versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without    1.6065767145351917
destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own    1.5636360329510388
decisions. Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar    1.6065767145351917
with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to    1.5636360329510388
be taken in by "busy-work" and <ersatz> decision making.    1.5127085093302464
In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of    1.7026049541338664
participation are what is called for at all. In the Notre Dame report,    1.67495327387791
reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced    1.6065767145351917
to "luncheon-table communication". In itself there is nothing wrong    1.5127085093302464
with this form of "participation": the only difficulty on the    1.5636360329510388
Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position    1.6432600607208703
to implement policy, i&e&, members of the religious community which    1.5636360329510388
owns and administers the institution, have their own eating arrangements.    1.5636360329510388
SEN& JOHN L& McCLELLAN of Arkansas and Rep& David    1.5127085093302464
Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions    1.6432600607208703
under the anti-monopoly laws. Once more the fallacious equation is advanced    1.6065767145351917
to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly    1.5636360329510388
laws, there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions:    1.5636360329510388
the law must treat everybody equally. Or, in the words of Anatole    1.6432600607208703
France, "The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich,    1.6065767145351917
as well as the poor, from begging in the streets and sleeping under    1.67495327387791
bridges".   The public atmosphere that has been generated which    1.5127085093302464
makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute    1.6065767145351917
into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr& McClellan's    1.67495327387791
hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and, later,    1.4513752902486308
into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations    1.4513752902486308
at the missile sites. The Senator was shocked by stoppages over    1.6065767145351917
allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program. In addition,    1.5636360329510388
disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess    1.5636360329510388
of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation    1.6065767145351917
on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill.    1.6065767145351917
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages, but    1.7026049541338664
he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes    1.5636360329510388
to fight a strike. <Business Week> (Aug& 9, 1961) reports that    1.6065767145351917
the United Aircraft Company, against which the International Association    1.5127085093302464
of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep its plants    1.6065767145351917
operating. The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable    1.5636360329510388
to four factors: advertising to attract new employees, hiring    1.5127085093302464
and training them, extra overtime, and defective work performed by    1.5636360329510388
the new workers. The company has billed the United States Government    1.6065767145351917
for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation    1.5636360329510388
allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and    1.5636360329510388
necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business.   Rep&    1.5127085093302464
Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the    1.5636360329510388
attention of the Armed Services Committee. The committee remains unresponsive.    1.5636360329510388
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan    1.3761581156320553
been heard from on the matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor    1.6432600607208703
THE    1.0
RECENT publicity attending the successful federal prosecution    1.3761581156320553
of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers    1.5636360329510388
has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified    1.6432600607208703
neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained. The    1.6432600607208703
anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete, but along completely    1.6432600607208703
undefined lines; it must play a game in which there never is    1.6432600607208703
a winner. The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully    1.67495327387791
cannot follow the law. Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a    1.6065767145351917
foolish public policy.   Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods    1.5127085093302464
industry in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number of    1.5636360329510388
other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy    1.5636360329510388
to rig prices and allocate the market. The industry is so structured    1.6432600607208703
that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way    1.6065767145351917
overhead charges are allocated- whether marginal or average pricing    1.5127085093302464
is applied.   The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise    1.6065767145351917
is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods    1.6432600607208703
in addition to the heavy electrical equipment. Accounting procedures    1.5127085093302464
can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price. Naturally,    1.6432600607208703
enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to    1.6432600607208703
structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors    1.6432600607208703
can be forced to the wall in a very short time. Should these giants    1.7026049541338664
really flex their competitive muscles, they would become the only    1.5636360329510388
survivors in the industry. Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating    1.6432600607208703
a monopoly by "unfair competition". But if they show self-restraint,    1.5636360329510388
they don't get the orders.   Under the circumstances,    1.4513752902486308
the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage    1.6065767145351917
in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter    1.67495327387791
were convicted. Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy    1.6432600607208703
by the giants. The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by    1.67495327387791
the demand of the government, after the conviction, that General Electric    1.6065767145351917
sign a wide-open consent decree that <it would not reduce prices    1.6065767145351917
so low as to compete seriously with its fellows>. In other words,    1.6432600607208703
the anti-trust laws, designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday,    1.6432600607208703
Wednesday and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer    1.6065767145351917
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. And which theory would    1.5127085093302464
THE QUESTION    1.0
might be asked: "Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods    1.5127085093302464
manufacturers know these facts? Why did they engage in a    1.5636360329510388
flood of <mea culpas>, throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise    1.67495327387791
to be good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence in    1.5636360329510388
the laws"?   The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to    1.5636360329510388
management was explained by Thurman Arnold, in <The Folklore of Capitalism>,    1.6065767145351917
back in 1937. He wrote: "(P& 211) **h the anti-trust    1.5636360329510388
laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need    1.6432600607208703
of great organizations, and at the same time had to deny them a place    1.7026049541338664
in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure. (P& 214)    1.6432600607208703
**h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled    1.5127085093302464
business dictatorship. (P& 215) **h when corporate abuses were attacked,    1.5636360329510388
it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked    1.6432600607208703
rather than control. **h In this manner, every scheme for direct    1.6065767145351917
control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust    1.6432600607208703
laws. (Pp& 228-229) **h in any event, it is obvious that the anti-trust    1.67495327387791
laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial    1.6432600607208703
empires the world has ever known, held together by some of the most    1.67495327387791
fantastic ideas, all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation    1.6065767145351917
is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control    1.6065767145351917
by the government".   This escape from control has led to management's    1.6065767145351917
evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as    1.4513752902486308
worth while. A plea of <nolo contendere>, followed by a nominal fine,    1.6432600607208703
after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license. (The    1.67495327387791
penalties handed out in the electrical case, which included jail    1.5636360329510388
sentences, were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions, perhaps because    1.4513752902486308
the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing    1.5127085093302464
activities.)   If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control    1.5636360329510388
of a fictitious impersonal market, quite obviously some method must    1.5636360329510388
be devised for representing the public interest. A secret conspiracy    1.5636360329510388
of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle. However, one can argue that    1.6432600607208703
no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust    1.67495327387791
laws are effective and rational. Quite clearly the anti-trust laws    1.5636360329510388
are neither effective nor rational- and yet the argument goes that    1.6065767145351917
they should be extended to the labor union.   THOSE WHO    1.5636360329510388
favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating    1.6432600607208703
a brand new reform.   Before 1933, individuals who opposed    1.5127085093302464
trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English.    1.5636360329510388
The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934,    1.6065767145351917
implicit in the writing of Section 7~A of the National Industrial    1.6065767145351917
Recovery Act, has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining    1.5636360329510388
in principle. The Wagner Act, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin    1.6065767145351917
Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.   1.4513752902486308
The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system    1.4513752902486308
is the removal of wages from competition. If a union cannot perform    1.6432600607208703
this function, then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers    1.6065767145351917
as a gigantic fraud.   The tortured reasoning that unions    1.5127085093302464
use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply    1.6432600607208703
and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession.    1.7026049541338664
The problem must be faced squarely. If laborers are merely commodities    1.6065767145351917
competing against each other in a market place like so many bags    1.6432600607208703
of wheat and corn (unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural subsidy),    1.6432600607208703
then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism    1.5636360329510388
to a system that imposes such status upon them.   Human labor    1.6065767145351917
was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century    1.5127085093302464
America. As early as 1776, Adam Smith wrote in <The Wealth of    1.6432600607208703
Nations>: "We have no acts of Parliament against combining    1.5127085093302464
to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it".    1.67495327387791
Eighteenth-century England, upon whose customs our common law was    1.5127085093302464
built, had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies. In 1825,    1.5636360329510388
the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced    1.6065767145351917
by the organized employers, who declared: "It is **h considered    1.5636360329510388
that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to **h effect    1.6432600607208703
the value of labor **h tend to convert all its branches into monopolies".   1.67495327387791
There were no pious hypocrisies then about being <for>    1.5127085093302464
collective bargaining, but <against> labor monopoly. The courts    1.4513752902486308
shared the opinion of the employers. In <People vs& Fisher>, Justice    1.6065767145351917
Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared:   "Without    1.5127085093302464
any officious and improper interference on the subject, the    1.5127085093302464
price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand    1.7026049541338664
for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid    1.6432600607208703
for it; but the right does not exist to raise **h the wages of the mechanic    1.748515906000203
by any forced and artificial means".   Compare this statement    1.5127085093302464
of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin, according    1.5127085093302464
to the <Daily Labor Report> of Sept& 19, 1961, defends    1.5636360329510388
the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor    1.6065767145351917
"if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages, production or    1.6065767145351917
prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his    1.7026049541338664
employees to contract on wages, hours and conditions of employment".   1.5636360329510388
Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust    1.4513752902486308
measures to unions in transportation. His bill, allegedly aimed at    1.5636360329510388
Hoffa, would amend the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts    1.5127085093302464
to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation    1.5636360329510388
strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert    1.67495327387791
with any other union- even a sister local in the same international.   1.6432600607208703
Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator McClellan was    1.5127085093302464
attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation,    1.5636360329510388
the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they    1.6065767145351917
met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action    1.67495327387791
would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act. Indeed, it    1.6432600607208703
is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently    1.6065767145351917
granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws; for example,    1.5127085093302464
the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the    1.6065767145351917
encouragement of railroads to seek mergers. At the very moment that    1.6065767145351917
every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality    1.67495327387791
of anti-trust legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective    1.5636360329510388
bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions    1.6065767145351917
who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that    1.7269387314284994
THE passage of the    1.0
Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies. It was most effective against    1.6432600607208703
trade unions. In the famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was    1.6065767145351917
brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices,    1.6065767145351917
e&g&, trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product    1.5636360329510388
of the struck manufacturer. The suit against the union was successful    1.6065767145351917
and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.   1.6065767145351917
In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under    1.6432600607208703
the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be    1.6432600607208703
considered a commodity. The law could not suspend economics. Labor remained    1.6065767145351917
a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization    1.5127085093302464
from the anti-trust laws.   The courts, by interpretation,    1.4513752902486308
emasculated the act. In 1922, the United Mine Workers struck the    1.6065767145351917
Coronado Coal Company. The company sued under the anti-trust laws,    1.5636360329510388
alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of    1.5636360329510388
interstate commerce. (What other purpose could a striking union have    1.5636360329510388
but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?) The    1.6432600607208703
court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference    1.6065767145351917
with commerce.    1.0
_THE THREE-FRONT WAR_ At a closed-door session    1.3761581156320553
on Capitol Hill last week, Secretary of State Christian Herter made    1.6065767145351917
his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on    1.5636360329510388
U&S& affairs abroad. Afterward, Tennessee's Democratic Senator    1.3761581156320553
Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen. What Herter presented,    1.5636360329510388
said Gore, was "not a very encouraging review". That was something    1.6065767145351917
of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between    1.6065767145351917
the West and Communism erupted on three fronts. While Communists    1.5636360329510388
were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos,    1.6065767145351917
two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration    1.4513752902486308
into emergency conferences and serious decisions. _1) CUBA._    1.4513752902486308
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery, Dictator    1.6432600607208703
Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U&S& with a blunt and    1.5636360329510388
drastic demand: within 48 hours, the U&S& had to reduce its    1.6065767145351917
embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons (the    1.67495327387791
embassy staff alone totaled 87 U&S& citizens, plus 120 Cuban    1.5636360329510388
employees). President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a&m& meeting with    1.5127085093302464
top military and foreign-policy advisers, decided to break off diplomatic    1.5636360329510388
relations immediately. "There is a limit to what the United    1.5636360329510388
States in self-respect can endure", said the President. "That limit    1.5636360329510388
has now been reached".   Through Secretary Herter, Ike    1.4513752902486308
offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new    1.5127085093302464
Administration with the breakoff decision. Kennedy, through Secretary-designate    1.4513752902486308
of State Dean Rusk, declined. He thus kept his hands    1.5636360329510388
free for any action after Jan& 20, although reaction to the break    1.6432600607208703
was generally favorable in the U&S& and Latin America (<see>    1.5636360329510388
THE HEMISPHERE). _2) LAOS._ After a White House huddle    1.5127085093302464
between the President and top lieutenants, the Defense Department reacted    1.5636360329510388
sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that    1.6065767145351917
several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North    1.5636360329510388
Viet Nam. "In view of the present situation in Laos", said the    1.6432600607208703
Pentagon's announcement, "we are taking normal precautionary actions    1.4513752902486308
to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific". Cutting    1.6065767145351917
short a holiday at Hong Kong, the aircraft carriers <Lexington>    1.5636360329510388
and <Bennington> steamed off into the South China Sea, accompanied    1.5636360329510388
by a swarm of destroyers, plus troopships loaded with marines.    1.5636360329510388
On the U&S&'s island base of Okinawa, Task Force 116, made    1.6065767145351917
up of Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force units, got braced to move    1.67495327387791
southward on signal.   But by week's end the Laotian cry of    1.6065767145351917
invasion was read as an exaggeration (<see> FOREIGN NEWS), and    1.5636360329510388
the U&S& was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies    1.6065767145351917
that a neutralist- rather than a pro-Western- government might    1.5127085093302464
be best for Laos. _FRENCH + INDIANS._ There was a moral of    1.6065767145351917
sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war    1.6432600607208703
fronts. Political, economic and military experts were all agreed that    1.5636360329510388
chaotic, mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world    1.6065767145351917
to fight a war- and they were probably right. "It would be like fighting    1.7026049541338664
the French and Indian War all over again", said one military    1.6065767145351917
man. But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?   1.5636360329510388
At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-China settled, the    1.6432600607208703
British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands    1.6065767145351917
and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state, North Viet    1.6432600607208703
Nam- which then, predictably, became a base for Communist operations    1.5636360329510388
against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos. The late Secretary    1.5636360329510388
of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement    1.5636360329510388
a specimen of appeasement, saw that resolution would be needed to    1.6065767145351917
keep it from becoming a calamity for the West. He began the diplomatic    1.67495327387791
discussions that resulted in the establishment of ~SEATO.    1.4513752902486308
"The important thing from now on", he said, "is not to mourn the    1.67495327387791
past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern    1.67495327387791
Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout    1.5636360329510388
Southeast Asia".   Russian tanks and artillery parading through    1.4513752902486308
the streets of Havana, Russian intrigue in the Congo, and Russian    1.6065767145351917
arms drops in Laos (using the same Ilyushin transports that were    1.6065767145351917
used to carry Communist agents to the Congo) made it plain once more    1.67495327387791
that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time. Soviet Premier    1.7269387314284994
Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect    1.5127085093302464
Kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply. Considering the    1.5636360329510388
state of the whole world, the cold war's three exposed fronts did    1.6432600607208703
not seem terribly ominous; but, in Senator Gore's words, it was    1.6065767145351917
"not a very encouraging" situation that would confront John F&    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy on Inauguration Day.    1.0
_TURMOIL IN THE    1.0
HOUSE_ As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week, liberal    1.6065767145351917
Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled    1.67495327387791
by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal    1.6432600607208703
legislation to the floor. The liberal pressure bloc (which coyly    1.5636360329510388
masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group) had fought the    1.5636360329510388
committee before, and had always lost. This time, they were much better    1.6432600607208703
prepared and organized, and the political climate was favorable.    1.5127085093302464
They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy, whose own    1.5636360329510388
legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck.    1.5127085093302464
And counting noses, they seemed to have the votes to work their will.    1.67495327387791
_DEADLY DEADLOCK._ There were two possible methods of breaching    1.5127085093302464
the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee: 1) to pack    1.5636360329510388
it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock,    1.5127085093302464
or 2) to remove one of the conservatives- namely Mississippi's    1.5636360329510388
14-term William Meyers Colmer (pronounced Calmer). Caucusing, the    1.4513752902486308
liberals decided to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic    1.6432600607208703
course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.   1.5636360329510388
A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer looks younger than    1.6432600607208703
his 70 years, has gradually swung from a moderate, internationalist    1.5636360329510388
position    1.0
to that of a diehard conservative. He is generally and initially    1.6065767145351917
suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens to benefit his    1.6065767145351917
Gulf Coast constituents. He is, of course, a segregationist, but    1.5636360329510388
he says he has never made an "anti-Negro" speech. For 20 years he    1.67495327387791
has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee. There his vote, along    1.6432600607208703
with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia judge,    1.5636360329510388
and the four Republican members, could and often did produce a 6-6    1.6432600607208703
deadlock that blocked far-out,    1.0
Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation    1.0
(a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership    1.5127085093302464
to avoid embarrassing votes). _EQUAL TREATMENT._ There was    1.4513752902486308
sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster: he had given his    1.5636360329510388
lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi. Reprisals    1.5127085093302464
are not unheard of in such situations, but the recent tendency has    1.6432600607208703
been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons. In 1949 the Dixiecrats    1.67495327387791
escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry    1.4513752902486308
Truman, and in 1957,    1.0
after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned    1.2818970554302986
for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, his fellow Democrats did not touch    1.6065767145351917
his committee assignments, although they did strip him temporarily    1.5127085093302464
of his patronage. (In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week,    1.6432600607208703
Judge    1.0
Smith threatened reprisal against Powell. Said he: "We will    1.5127085093302464
see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here".)    1.6065767145351917
But Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach with    1.5636360329510388
President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year something had to be    1.5636360329510388
done about the Rules Committee- and that he was the only man who could    1.7026049541338664
do anything effective.   In a tense, closed-door session with    1.5127085093302464
Judge Smith, Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add    1.6065767145351917
three new members to the Rules Committee (two Democrats, including    1.5636360329510388
one Southerner, and one Republican). Smith flatly rejected the offer,    1.5636360329510388
and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels. The next    1.6065767145351917
morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and    1.67495327387791
broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust Colmer, whom he    1.67495327387791
is said to regard as "an inferior man".   News of    1.5636360329510388
Rayburn's    1.0
commitment soon leaked out. When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got    1.5127085093302464
the word, he turned purple. "Unconscionable"! he shouted, and    1.5127085093302464
rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object: "A dangerous precedent"!    1.6065767145351917
Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome support    1.4513752902486308
to the Smith-Colmer forces: as chairman of the Appropriations    1.5127085093302464
Committee, he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding    1.6065767145351917
this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects.    1.5127085093302464
Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge    1.6065767145351917
Smith ally, Georgia's Carl Vinson, chairman of the Armed Services    1.5636360329510388
Committee. _THREAT OF WAR._ As the battle raged in the cloakrooms    1.6065767145351917
and caucuses, it became clear that Judge Smith could lose. His    1.6065767145351917
highest count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly twice    1.6065767145351917
that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus. The liberals,    1.5636360329510388
smelling blood, were faced with the necessity of winning three    1.5636360329510388
big votes- in the Democratic Committee on Committees, in the full    1.6065767145351917
party caucus, and on the floor of the House- before they could oust    1.67495327387791
Colmer. (One big question: If Colmer was to be purged, what should    1.6432600607208703
the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported    1.6065767145351917
the maverick electors?) In all three arenas, they seemed certain    1.5636360329510388
of victory- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash.   1.5127085093302464
But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter    1.6065767145351917
of losing a costlier war. If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused,    1.6065767145351917
they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons    1.6065767145351917
from their vantage point of committee chairmanships, leaving Sam    1.5127085093302464
Rayburn leading a truncated, unworkable party. With that possibility    1.5127085093302464
in mind, Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a    1.5127085093302464
meeting of the Committee on Committees, and coolheaded Democrats sought    1.5636360329510388
to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort    1.6432600607208703
of face-saving compromise. "Here are two old men, mad at each other    1.6432600607208703
and too proud to pick up the phone", said a House Democratic leader.    1.67495327387791
"One wants a little more power, and the other doesn't want    1.6065767145351917
to give up any". _BATTLE IN THE SENATE_ The Senate launched the    1.6432600607208703
87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative    1.5636360329510388
battle, but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed    1.6065767145351917
as <pro forma> as a Capitol guide's speech. Question at issue:    1.6065767145351917
How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate- and    1.6432600607208703
thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters?   A wide-ranging,    1.3761581156320553
bipartisan force- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey    1.3761581156320553
to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall- was    1.2818970554302986
drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats, who have traditionally    1.6432600607208703
used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills. New Mexico's    1.5636360329510388
Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's    1.5127085093302464
notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and    1.6065767145351917
voting to cut off debate, instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds.    1.6065767145351917
Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power for a    1.6065767145351917
mere majority of Senators. Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely,    1.5127085093302464
and the battle was joined.   Privately, the liberals admitted    1.5127085093302464
that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage. Privately,    1.5636360329510388
they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths    1.5636360329510388
modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon.    1.5127085093302464
In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of    1.6065767145351917
Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each    1.67495327387791
new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were    1.6432600607208703
not binding.   Armed with the Nixon opinion, the Senate liberals    1.5636360329510388
rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate    1.6065767145351917
on the filibuster battle this week. Hopefully, the perennial battle    1.5636360329510388
of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all.    1.7026049541338664
_LAST ACT_ Since Election Day, Vice President    1.3761581156320553
Richard Nixon had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public    1.6065767145351917
view. But with the convening of the new Congress, he was the public    1.67495327387791
man again, presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration.    1.5636360329510388
One day last week, Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore    1.5636360329510388
that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to    1.6432600607208703
hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote, and then to    1.6432600607208703
make "sufficient declaration" of the election of the man who defeated    1.6065767145351917
him in the tight 1960 presidential election. Nixon fulfilled his    1.5636360329510388
assignment with grace, then went beyond the required "sufficient declaration".   1.5636360329510388
"This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate    1.6065767145351917
for the presidency announced the result of an election in which    1.6065767145351917
he was defeated", he said.   1.1606783668269585
The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do    1.6065767145351917
to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves. Gary Player, the small,    1.6432600607208703
trim South African, was the eventual winner, but in all his 25    1.6432600607208703
years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the    1.67495327387791
victory to drop in his lap. Arnold Palmer, the defending champion, lost    1.6432600607208703
his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that    1.67495327387791
left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.   "Just when you    1.6065767145351917
think you have it licked, this golf course can get up and bite you",    1.7026049541338664
Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament. And    1.5636360329510388
that is just what happened on the last few holes. The Augusta National    1.67495327387791
Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer.   1.6065767145351917
Player was the first to feel its teeth. After playing a splendid first    1.67495327387791
nine holes in 34- two strokes under par- on this fifth and final    1.67495327387791
day of the tournament (Sunday's fourth round had been washed out    1.6065767145351917
by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed), Player's    1.6065767145351917
game rapidly fell to pieces. He bogeyed the 10th. After a journey through    1.67495327387791
woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th. He bogeyed the 15th    1.6065767145351917
by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three    1.6432600607208703
holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total    1.6432600607208703
of 280.   As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course,    1.6432600607208703
Player was almost in tears. He could read on the nearby scoreboard    1.6432600607208703
that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole, was leading him by a stroke.    1.7026049541338664
Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player, and at    1.6065767145351917
one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes. Now    1.7026049541338664
all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the    1.748515906000203
biggest single paycheck in golf.   When Palmer hit a good straight    1.6065767145351917
drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship    1.7026049541338664
won. But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green    1.6065767145351917
strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression. In trying to    1.67495327387791
hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green,    1.7026049541338664
past spectators and down the slope toward a ~TV tower.   Afterwards,    1.6065767145351917
Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round partner, that he    1.5127085093302464
simply played the hole too fast. He did seem hasty on his second and    1.7026049541338664
third shots, but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while    1.67495327387791
Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to recover his    1.6065767145351917
composure,    1.0
which he had quite visibly lost.   When the shaken Palmer    1.5636360329510388
finally did hit his fourth shot, he overshot the hole by 15 feet.    1.67495327387791
Palmer was now putting merely for a tie, and Player, who was sitting    1.67495327387791
beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman    1.6432600607208703
Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment, stared in amazement when    1.4513752902486308
Palmer missed the putt.   Palmer's 281 for the four rounds    1.5636360329510388
at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest    1.6432600607208703
pro, but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe.    1.67495327387791
The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur, who has been playing topnotch    1.6065767145351917
tournament golf for many years, refused to let the Masters jitters    1.6065767145351917
overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69.    1.6065767145351917
Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played    1.4513752902486308
seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters- four last year    1.6065767145351917
and three this- without ever being out of first place. As evening    1.6432600607208703
approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing    1.5636360329510388
one-over-par 73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks to    1.5636360329510388
his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69. His three-round total    1.6432600607208703
of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score, a 213 by Bill    1.7269387314284994
Collins, the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing    1.5636360329510388
very well all winter long.   But Palmer knew, as did everybody    1.6065767145351917
else at Augusta, that his streak was about to be broken. Half an hour    1.7026049541338664
after he finished his round, Player holed out at the 18th green with    1.67495327387791
a 69 and a three-round total of 206, four strokes ahead of Palmer.   1.67495327387791
More than a streak had ended. Long after the erratic climate    1.6065767145351917
and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological    1.5636360329510388
footnotes, the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the    1.6432600607208703
<mano a mano> between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. Unlike most    1.6065767145351917
such sports rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously,    1.5636360329510388
although this was not exactly the case.   When the winter    1.5636360329510388
tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to    1.7026049541338664
challenge Palmer's towering prestige. As if to confirm his stature,    1.5636360329510388
he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments. Player won only    1.6432600607208703
one. But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago, Player was    1.6432600607208703
leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars, and the    1.6432600607208703
rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere. On the final round at    1.7026049541338664
Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same    1.67495327387791
threesome and, although it was far from obvious at the time, the gallery    1.67495327387791
was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of    1.67495327387791
the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.   On    1.67495327387791
that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading    1.6065767145351917
the tournament and, as it turned out, neither won it. But whichever    1.6432600607208703
of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial    1.67495327387791
leader of the tour. Player immediately proved he was not in the    1.6432600607208703
least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer. He outplayed Palmer    1.6065767145351917
all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's    1.6432600607208703
71. Thereafter, until the Masters, Player gradually increased    1.4513752902486308
his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory    1.6432600607208703
at Miami. When they reached Augusta last week, together they had    1.6065767145351917
won five of the 13 tournaments to date.    1.4513752902486308
On Thursday,    1.0
the first day of the Masters, the contest between Palmer and    1.6065767145351917
Player developed instantly. It was a dismal, drizzly day but a good    1.6432600607208703
one on which to score over the Augusta National course. The usually    1.6432600607208703
skiddy greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able to strike    1.67495327387791
their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward    1.6065767145351917
the hole without too much worry about the consequences. Palmer's 4-under-par    1.6065767145351917
68 got him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob Rosburg.    1.7026049541338664
But Player was only one stroke back, with a 69.   Even    1.6065767145351917
so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators-    1.7026049541338664
unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever- that this tournament    1.5127085093302464
was to be, essentially, a match between Palmer and Player. A lot    1.6432600607208703
of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus, the spectacular    1.5636360329510388
young amateur, who had a 70; or Ken Venturi, who had a somewhat shaky    1.7026049541338664
72 but was bound to do better; or Rosburg, whose accurate short    1.6432600607208703
game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries;    1.6065767145351917
or even old Byron Nelson, whose excellent 71 made one    1.5636360329510388
wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf. (On Thursday    1.6432600607208703
nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe.)   On    1.5636360329510388
Friday, a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and    1.67495327387791
ugly, the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus. Rosburg    1.6065767145351917
had started early in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were    1.7026049541338664
on the course- separated, as they were destined to be for the rest    1.67495327387791
of the weekend,    1.0
by about half an hour- they could see on the numerous    1.6065767145351917
scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a    1.6065767145351917
73, was not having a good day.   As Player began his second round    1.67495327387791
in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery    1.6432600607208703
was not conspicuously large for a contender. Player began with a birdie    1.6432600607208703
on the first hole, added five straight pars and then another birdie    1.6432600607208703
at the 9th. On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of    1.7269387314284994
a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament. He birdied    1.67495327387791
the 13th, the 15th and the 18th- five birdies, one bogey and 12 pars    1.7026049541338664
for a 68.   Starting half an hour behind Player in company with    1.6432600607208703
British Open Champion Kel Nagle, Palmer birdied the 2nd, the    1.5636360329510388
9th, the 13th and the 16th- four birdies, one bogey and 13 pars for    1.7026049541338664
a 69. The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would    1.7026049541338664
roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be answered    1.6432600607208703
moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph.    1.6432600607208703
At one point late in the day, when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot    1.7026049541338664
putt on the 16th, a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th    1.67495327387791
green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole.    1.5636360329510388
Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed    1.7269387314284994
(although he later admitted that he had) Palmer proceeded to sink    1.6065767145351917
his 25-footer, and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling    1.5636360329510388
back along the intervening fairways in reply.    1.3761581156320553
Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way    1.6065767145351917
had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing    1.6065767145351917
this most difficult golf course. It is almost axiomatic that golfers    1.6065767145351917
who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots    1.7026049541338664
with a vehemence bordering on violence. The bad luck that can so often    1.67495327387791
mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated    1.6065767145351917
by the contemptuous boldness of these champions. Bob Jones played    1.5636360329510388
that way. Byron Nelson did, Hogan did. And last week at the Masters    1.67495327387791
Palmer and Player did.   As the third round of the tournament    1.6065767145351917
began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's    1.67495327387791
superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead. This    1.5127085093302464
day Palmer had started first. As Player stepped on the first tee    1.6432600607208703
he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was    1.67495327387791
2 under par for the day. Player immediately proceeded to follow suit.    1.6432600607208703
In fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well, to go 4 under    1.7677783654484436
par for the first eight holes.   But Player's real test came    1.6065767145351917
on the ninth hole, a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.    1.67495327387791
He hit a poor tee shot, pulling it off into the pine woods separating    1.7026049541338664
the 9th and first fairways. Having hit one of the trees, the ball came    1.7026049541338664
to rest not more than 160 yards out. Player then had the choice of    1.7026049541338664
punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling    1.7026049541338664
for a bogey 5, or gambling. The latter involved hitting a full    1.6432600607208703
four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse, hoping to    1.6432600607208703
slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.   "I was hitting    1.6432600607208703
the ball well", Player said later, "and I felt strong. When    1.6065767145351917
you're playing like that you'd better attack".   Player attacked    1.5127085093302464
with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever    1.7026049541338664
forget. It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the    1.7026049541338664
edge. From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.   1.7026049541338664
Palmer, meanwhile, had been having his troubles. They started on    1.5636360329510388
the 4th hole, a 220-yard par-3. On this day the wind had switched 180`    1.7026049541338664
from the northwest to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the    1.6432600607208703
course was different from the previous few days. At the 4th tee Palmer    1.67495327387791
chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club, so    1.67495327387791
he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green. His bogey 4 on this    1.7677783654484436
hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought    1.7269387314284994
him back to even par.   Starting the second nine, Palmer was    1.6065767145351917
already four strokes behind Player and knew it.   1.4513752902486308
When Mickey Charles Mantle, the New York Yankees' man    1.5127085093302464
of muscle, drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers, his feat touches    1.7026049541338664
upon the sublime. When Roger Eugene Maris, Mantle's muscular    1.5127085093302464
teammate, powers four home runs in a double-header, his performance    1.5636360329510388
merits awe. But when tiny, 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the    1.6065767145351917
Los Angeles Angels, who once caught three straight fly balls in center    1.6432600607208703
field because, as a teammate explained, "the other team thought    1.5636360329510388
no one was out there", hits seven home runs in four months (three    1.67495327387791
more than his total in 1958, 1959, and 1960), his achievement borders    1.6432600607208703
on the ridiculous. This is Baseball 1961. This is the year home runs    1.67495327387791
ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.   It is the year when    1.6432600607208703
(1) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the    1.6065767145351917
plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented    1.6065767145351917
style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs; (2) Willie Mays    1.5127085093302464
of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became    1.6065767145351917
the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game; (3) the    1.7026049541338664
Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs    1.5636360329510388
in three games and lost two of them; and (4) catcher Johnny Blanchard    1.67495327387791
of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four    1.67495327387791
successive times at bat, two of them as a pinch-hitter.   Pitchers    1.6065767145351917
grumble about lively balls and lively bats, the shrinking strike    1.5636360329510388
zone, and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal. Experts    1.6432600607208703
point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused    1.6432600607208703
by expansion. Whatever the reasons, not in 30 years has a single season    1.67495327387791
produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records,    1.5636360329510388
home-run division.   Of all the records in peril, one stands    1.5636360329510388
apart, dramatic in its making, dramatic in its endurance, and now,    1.6065767145351917
doubly dramatic in its jeopardy. This, of course, is baseball's most    1.6065767145351917
remarkable mark: The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible    1.6432600607208703
epicure, the incredible athlete, George Herman (Babe) Ruth of the    1.5636360329510388
Yankees.   Since 1927, fewer than a dozen men have made serious    1.6065767145351917
runs at Babe Ruth's record and each, in turn, has been thwarted.    1.6432600607208703
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September    1.5127085093302464
surge. In the final month of the 1927 season, he hit seventeen    1.6432600607208703
home runs, a closing spurt never matched.    1.3761581156320553
Always,    1.0
in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record, one man alone- a    1.6065767145351917
Jimmy Foxx (58 in 1932) or a Hank Greenberg (58 in 1938) or a Hack    1.7269387314284994
Wilson (56 in 1930)- made the bid. But now, for the first time    1.67495327387791
since Lou Gehrig (with 47 home runs) spurred Ruth on in 1927, two men    1.7026049541338664
playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60. Their names are Mantle    1.7026049541338664
and Maris, their team is the Yankees, and their threat is real.   1.6432600607208703
After 108 games in 1927, Ruth had 35 home runs. After 108    1.6432600607208703
games in 1961, Mickey Mantle has 43, Roger Maris 41. Extend Mantle's    1.6432600607208703
and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162    1.6065767145351917
games, and, mathematically, each will hit more than 60 home runs. This    1.6432600607208703
is the    1.0
great edge the two Yankees have going for them. To better Ruth's    1.6432600607208703
mark, neither needs a spectacular September flourish. All Mantle    1.5127085093302464
needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September,    1.6432600607208703
and he will establish a new record. In Ruth's day- and until this    1.67495327387791
year- the schedule was 154 games. Baseball commissioner Ford Frick    1.5636360329510388
has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is    1.6065767145351917
broken in 154 games.)   "Even on the basis of 154 games, this    1.6432600607208703
is the ideal situation", insists Hank Greenberg, now vice-president    1.5127085093302464
of the Chicago White Sox. "It has to be easier with two of them.    1.7026049541338664
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle"?    1.5127085093302464
Neither Mantle nor Maris, understandably, will predict 60 home runs    1.5636360329510388
for himself. Although both concede they would like to hit 60, they    1.6432600607208703
stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: "The    1.5127085093302464
important thing is to win the pennant". But one thing is for certain:    1.67495327387791
There is no dissension between Mantle, the American League's    1.5127085093302464
Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957, and Maris, the ~MVP    1.6065767145351917
in 1960. Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ("I hope Roger    1.67495327387791
hits 80", Mantle says), and each enjoys even more seeing himself    1.6065767145351917
hit home runs ("and I hope I hit 81").   The sluggers get    1.6432600607208703
along so well in fact, that with their families at home for the summer    1.7026049541338664
(Mantle's in Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City), they are rooming    1.5636360329510388
together. Mantle, Maris, and Bob Cerv, a utility outfielder, share    1.5636360329510388
an apartment in Jamaica, Long Island, not far from New York    1.6065767145351917
International Airport. The three pay $251 a month for four rooms (kitchen,    1.6432600607208703
dining room, living room, and bedroom), with air-conditioning    1.4513752902486308
and new modern furniture. Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom;    1.7026049541338664
Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room. They    1.6432600607208703
divide up the household chores: Cerv does most of the cooking (breakfast    1.6432600607208703
and sandwich snacks, with dinner out), Mantle supplies the    1.5127085093302464
transportation (a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible), and Maris drives    1.5127085093302464
the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium.    1.5636360329510388
Mantle, Maris, and Cerv probably share one major-league record already:    1.5636360329510388
Among them, they have fifteen children- eight for Cerv, four    1.5636360329510388
for Mantle, and three for Maris.   As roommates, teammates,    1.5127085093302464
and home-run mates, Mantle, 29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years    1.67495327387791
ago, and Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City    1.6432600607208703
two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds. Both were scholastic    1.5636360329510388
stars in football, basketball, and baseball (Mantle in Commerce,    1.5127085093302464
Okla&, Maris in Fargo, N&D&); as halfbacks, both came close    1.5636360329510388
to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ("Sometimes    1.5127085093302464
in the minors", Maris recalls, "I wished I had gone to Oklahoma").   1.6432600607208703
To an extent, the two even look alike. Both have blue    1.6065767145351917
eyes and short blond hair. Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195    1.7026049541338664
and 200 pounds, but Mantle, incredibly muscular (he has a 17-1/2-inch    1.6065767145351917
neck), looks bigger. With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders,    1.5636360329510388
both must have their clothes made to order. Maris purchases $100    1.6065767145351917
suits from Simpson's in New York. Mantle, more concerned with    1.5636360329510388
dress, buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and    1.67495327387791
pays as much as $250 each.    1.2818970554302986
Neither Mantle nor    1.0
Maris need fear being classified an intellectual, but lately Mantle    1.5636360329510388
has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's    1.5636360329510388
"Tropic of Cancer". Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate    1.4513752902486308
literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive    1.5636360329510388
passages aloud during road trips.   Mantle is not normally    1.5127085093302464
given to public speaking- or, for that matter, to private speaking.    1.6065767145351917
"What do you and Mickey talk about at home"? a reporter asked    1.6432600607208703
Maris recently.   "To tell you the truth", Maris said, "Mickey    1.5636360329510388
don't talk much".   This is no surprising trait for    1.5127085093302464
a ballplayer. What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris,    1.6432600607208703
under constant pressure from writers and photographers, are trying    1.5127085093302464
to be cooperative.   Of the two, Mantle is by nature the less    1.6432600607208703
outgoing, Maris the more outspoken. But last week, when a reporter    1.6065767145351917
was standing near Mantle's locker, Mickey walked up and volunteered    1.5636360329510388
an anecdote. "See that kid"? he said, pointing to a dark-haired    1.6065767145351917
11-year-old boy. "That's [Yogi] Berra's. I'll never    1.3761581156320553
forget one time I struck out three times, dropped a fly ball, and we    1.7026049541338664
lost the game. I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real low,    1.67495327387791
and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says: 'You stunk'".   1.67495327387791
Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer all questions    1.5636360329510388
candidly and fully, but on rare occasions, he shuns newsmen. "When    1.6065767145351917
I've made a dumb play", he says, "I don't want to talk to    1.67495327387791
anyone. I'm angry".   By his own confession, Maris is an    1.5636360329510388
angry young man. Benched at Tulsa in 1955, he told manager Dutch Meyer:    1.67495327387791
"I can't play for you. Send me where I can play". (Meyer    1.6432600607208703
sent him to Reading, Pa&.) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956,    1.5636360329510388
he told manager Kerby Farrell: "I'm not learning anything on    1.5636360329510388
the bench. Play me". (Farrell did- and Maris led the team to victory    1.67495327387791
in the Little World Series.) "That's the way I am",    1.5636360329510388
he says. "I tell people what I think. If you're a good ballplayer,    1.67495327387791
you've got to get mad. Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll    1.7269387314284994
give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of    1.7026049541338664
ten times".    1.0
One good indication of the two    1.2818970554302986
men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.    1.6432600607208703
Maris's was Ted Williams. "When I was a kid", Maris    1.5636360329510388
told a sportswriter last week, "I used to follow Williams every day    1.6432600607208703
in the box score, just to see whether he got a hit or not".   1.7026049541338664
"When you came up to the majors, did you seek out Williams for advice"?   1.7026049541338664
"Are you kidding"? said Maris. "You're    1.2818970554302986
afraid to talk to a guy you idolize".   Mantle's hero was Joe    1.6432600607208703
DiMaggio. "When Mickey went to the Yankees", says Mark Freeman,    1.5636360329510388
an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver, "DiMaggio    1.5636360329510388
still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker,    1.6432600607208703
just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man, this    1.6432600607208703
hero of his. But DiMaggio never said a word. It crushed Mickey.    1.6432600607208703
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star, this    1.7677783654484436
never would be said of him". Mantle has kept the vow. Among all    1.67495327387791
the Yankees, he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.   Neither    1.6065767145351917
Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else.    1.6065767145351917
If laying ties on a railroad track, which he once did for $1 an hour,    1.7269387314284994
paid more than playing right field for the Yankees, Maris would    1.6065767145351917
lay ties on a railroad track. If working in a zinc mine, which he once    1.7269387314284994
did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than playing center field for    1.67495327387791
the Yankees, Mantle would work in a zinc mine. But since railroading    1.6432600607208703
and mining are not the highest paid arts, Mantle and Maris concentrate    1.6432600607208703
on baseball. They try to play baseball the best they can.   1.6065767145351917
Each is a complete ballplayer. Mantle, beyond any question, can    1.5636360329510388
do more things well. ("One of the reasons they get along fine",    1.6432600607208703
says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men, "is that both    1.67495327387791
realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris".) Hitting,    1.3761581156320553
Mantle    1.0
has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed,    1.6065767145351917
Maris only left-handed. They both possess near classic    1.4513752902486308
stances,    1.0
dug in firmly, arms high, set for fierce swings. Mantle is considerably    1.6432600607208703
better hitting for average (.332, fourth in the league, to .280    1.6065767145351917
for Maris so far this year).   Both are good bunters: Maris    1.6065767145351917
once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues; Mantle    1.6065767145351917
is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base. Both have brilliant    1.67495327387791
speed: Mantle was timed from home plate (batting left-handed) to    1.5636360329510388
first base in 3.1 seconds, faster than any other major leaguer; Maris    1.6432600607208703
ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a    1.7026049541338664
race against Luis Aparicio, the swift, base-stealing shortstop of the    1.5636360329510388
White Sox. Both are good, daring fielders: Mantle covers more    1.5636360329510388
ground; Maris's throwing arm is stronger.   Yet with all their    1.5636360329510388
skills, the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one    1.67495327387791
basic: The home run. With this ultimate weapon, the two Yankees    1.6065767145351917
may have saved baseball from its dullest season. (American League expansion    1.6065767145351917
created, inevitably, weaker teams. Only two teams in each league    1.5636360329510388
[the Yankees and Detroit, the Dodgers and Cincinnati] are battling    1.5636360329510388
for first place.   Appropriately, the emphasis on the home    1.5127085093302464
run, at a peak this year, came into being at baseball's lowest moment.    1.67495327387791
In 1920, as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired    1.67495327387791
to lose the World Series leaked out, fans grew disillusioned    1.5636360329510388
and disinterested in baseball. Something was needed to revive interest;    1.5636360329510388
the something was the home run.   1.2818970554302986

and his close Hollywood pal, Cinemactor Peter Lawford, Jack    1.5127085093302464
Kennedy's brother-in-law. Also included in the entourage: a dog    1.5127085093302464
in a black sweater, Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission: to stage    1.67495327387791
a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's    1.5127085093302464
National Guard Armory. Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas, as    1.5636360329510388
he had hinted upon his arrival: "It's really tremendous when you    1.6065767145351917
think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia. I could talk to    1.6065767145351917
you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans"!    1.748515906000203
As the plans were laid, some several thousand fat cats were to    1.6432600607208703
be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced    1.67495327387791
at $10,000 each. The biggest single act would doubtless be staged    1.6065767145351917
by Frankie himself: his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by    1.5636360329510388
Hollywood Couturier Don Loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles.    1.5636360329510388
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered    1.5636360329510388
"two of everything" just "in case he spills anything", Frankie    1.5636360329510388
got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch    1.748515906000203
A year after he was catapulted over    1.3761581156320553
nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps,    1.6432600607208703
General {David M& Shoup} delivered a peppery annual report    1.5127085093302464
in the form of a "happy, warless New Year" greeting to his    1.6432600607208703
Pentagon staff. Said Leatherneck Shoup: "A year ago I took the    1.6065767145351917
grips of the plow in my hands. After pushing an accumulation of vines    1.67495327387791
and weeds from the moldboard, I lifted the lines from the dust and    1.67495327387791
found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on. Little    1.7269387314284994
geeing and hawing have been necessary". But Shoup also gave    1.5636360329510388
the Corps a tilling in spots. Speaking of "pride", he deplored    1.6065767145351917
the noncommissioned officer "whose uniform looks like it belonged to    1.5636360329510388

an undergraduate for a while. The principal of the school announced    1.6065767145351917
that- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia-    1.6065767145351917
Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics.    1.5127085093302464
Lacking his needed credits in those subjects, Fabian will not    1.5636360329510388

some time this summer because "I have marveled at your grandiose experiment    1.6432600607208703
and I believe in your future". Then Charlie spooned out    1.5636360329510388

G& David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards    1.6432600607208703
of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels,    1.5636360329510388
but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town    1.7269387314284994
of Pittsburgh. There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth, a    1.5636360329510388
reputation for eccentricity, and an ardor for collecting art. Last week,    1.6065767145351917
in the German city of Du^sseldorf, G& David Thompson was    1.5636360329510388
making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause. On display were    1.6065767145351917
343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-    1.5127085093302464
and every single one of them was up for sale.   Like Philadelphia's    1.6432600607208703
late Dr& Albert C& Barnes who kept his own great collection    1.6065767145351917
closed to the general public (TIME, Jan& 2), Thompson,    1.5127085093302464
at 61, is something of a legend in his own lifetime. He made his    1.7026049541338664
fortune during World War /2, when he took over a number of dying    1.67495327387791
steel plants and kept them alive until the boom. Even before he hit    1.67495327387791
big money, he had begun buying modern paintings. He gave the impression    1.6432600607208703
of never having read a word about art, but there was no doubt that    1.7026049541338664
he had an eye for the best.   He was able to smell a bargain-    1.7026049541338664
and a masterpiece- a continent away, and the Museum of Modern Art's    1.6432600607208703
Alfred Barr said of him: "I have never mentioned a new artist    1.6432600607208703
that Thompson didn't know about". He might barge into a gallery,    1.6065767145351917
start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting.    1.6432600607208703
He could be lavishly generous with friends, cab drivers and bellboys,    1.6065767145351917
but with dealers he was tough. He bought up Cezannes, Braques, Matisses,    1.6432600607208703
Legers, a splendid Picasso series, more than 70 Giacometti    1.5127085093302464
sculptures. He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees    1.6065767145351917
in the world. All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's    1.67495327387791
Throw, outside Pittsburgh, and only people he liked and trusted    1.5636360329510388
ever got to see them.   Two years ago Thompson offered his    1.6065767145351917
collection to the city. But he insisted that it be housed in a special    1.7026049541338664
museum. Pittsburgh turned him down, just as Pittsburgh society had    1.5636360329510388
been snubbing him for years. He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art    1.67495327387791
dealer named Ernst Beyeler, with whom he had long been trading pictures.    1.6432600607208703
Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees    1.5636360329510388
to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which will house them in    1.6065767145351917
a museum that is yet to be built. Last week most of the other prizes,    1.7269387314284994
once offered to Pittsburgh, went on the block.   At the opening    1.6065767145351917
of the Du^sseldorf show, Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the    1.5636360329510388
treasures that he was seeing together for the last time. In fact he    1.67495327387791
seemed delighted to get rid of them. Some observers speculated that    1.6065767145351917
this might be his revenge on his home town. Thompson himself said:    1.6432600607208703
"I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new    1.7026049541338664
pictures".    1.0
The University of Georgia has long claimed that    1.4513752902486308
it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis    1.5636360329510388
of race or color. But in all its 175 years, not a single Negro    1.7026049541338664
student has entered its classrooms. Last week Federal District Judge    1.5636360329510388
William A& Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately    1.5127085093302464
a "qualified" Negro boy and girl. Their entry will crack the    1.6065767145351917
total segregation of all public education, from kindergarten through graduate    1.5636360329510388
school, in Georgia- and in Alabama, Mississippi and South    1.5127085093302464
Carolina as well.   For 18 months, Hamilton Holmes, 19, and    1.5636360329510388
Charlayne Hunter, 18, had tried to get into the university. They graduated    1.6432600607208703
together from Atlanta's Turner High School, where Valedictorian    1.4513752902486308
Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third. The university    1.6065767145351917
rejected them on a variety of pretexts, but was careful never    1.6065767145351917
to mention the color of their skins. Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse    1.6432600607208703
(Negro) College, where he is a B+ student and star halfback.    1.6065767145351917
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University.    1.4513752902486308
Last fall, after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to    1.6065767145351917
court, Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again.   Charlayne    1.5127085093302464
was "tentatively" admitted for next fall, after state investigators    1.5127085093302464
questioned her white roommate at Wayne State. But Holmes was rejected    1.6065767145351917
again "on the basis of his record and interview". The evidence    1.6065767145351917
in court was testimony about the interview, which for Holmes lasted    1.6065767145351917
an hour, although at least one white student at Georgia got through    1.6432600607208703
this ritual by a simple phone conversation. Holmes was asked if he    1.6432600607208703
had ever visited a house of prostitution, or a "beatnik parlor or teahouse".    1.67495327387791
No, said he, but officials still called him "evasive".    1.5127085093302464
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been "arrested".    1.67495327387791
Their reason: Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine, had his license    1.6432600607208703
suspended.   Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white    1.5636360329510388
students, found that many were hardly interviewed at all- and few    1.6065767145351917
had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes. The real reason    1.6065767145351917
for his rejection, they argued, is the fact that Georgia law automatically    1.6432600607208703
cuts off funds for any desegregated school.   Judge Bootle's    1.5127085093302464
decision: "The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission    1.4513752902486308
to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been    1.67495327387791
for their race and color". The state will appeal- but few think    1.6432600607208703
it will actually try to close the university. "Surprised and pleased",    1.6065767145351917
Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia    1.5636360329510388

When the University of    1.0
Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A& Kimpton    1.1606783668269585
submitted his resignation last March, a mighty talent hunt    1.5127085093302464
gripped the Midway. Out went letters to 60,000 old grads, asking for    1.6432600607208703
suggestions. Such academic statesmen as James B& Conant were consulted.    1.5636360329510388
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors, including    1.4513752902486308
Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, and Harvard's Dean McGeorge    1.4513752902486308
Bundy. The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither    1.6065767145351917
a big name nor an experienced academic administrator, but rather,    1.5636360329510388
as Trustee Chairman Glen A& Lloyd put it, "a top scholar in    1.6432600607208703
his own right"- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.   1.67495327387791
Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's    1.5636360329510388
acting dean of the faculty: dynamic Geneticist George Wells    1.5127085093302464
Beadle, 57, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology    1.6432600607208703
for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell    1.5127085093302464
chemistry (TIME, Cover, July 14, 1958).   It fell to Chancellor    1.5636360329510388
Kimpton, now a Standard Oil (Indiana) executive, to spend    1.5127085093302464
his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of    1.6065767145351917
Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins. He threw out some of Hutchins'    1.5636360329510388
more wildly experimental courses, raised sagging undergraduate enrollment    1.4513752902486308
to 2,100, nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million. But though    1.5636360329510388
Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order, some old grads    1.67495327387791
feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it    1.67495327387791
in the heady Hutchins era.   At Caltech, Geneticist Beadle    1.5127085093302464
has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology    1.67495327387791
division since 1946. But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot,    1.6432600607208703
recruit and excite able researchers, and has developed unexpected    1.5127085093302464
talents in fund raising and speech-making. Beadle is even that rare    1.6065767145351917
scientist    1.0
who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads the    1.6065767145351917
<Wall Street Journal>, and took delight in driving a $250 model ~A    1.6432600607208703
Ford for 22 years, then selling it for $300.   1.5127085093302464
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began    1.6432600607208703
with the old Adam and consequently will never end. But a historian    1.6432600607208703
might put his finger on a specific man and date, and hold out the hope    1.7269387314284994
that the troubles will sometime pass away. The man was King Leopold    1.6432600607208703
/2, of the Belgians, who in 1885 concluded that he had better    1.6432600607208703
grab a colony while the grabbing was still good. By force, he took under    1.7026049541338664
his protection, or stole, 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central    1.6065767145351917
Africa. This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe;    1.6065767145351917
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political    1.67495327387791
or historical unity. Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography    1.6065767145351917
or ethnic groupings; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's    1.6432600607208703
explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.   The population    1.5127085093302464
of the Congo is 13.5 million, divided into at least seven major    1.6432600607208703
"culture clusters" and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate    1.4513752902486308
dialects. The religions of the people include Christianity, Mohammedanism,    1.5127085093302464
paganism, ancestor worship and animism. The climate ranges from    1.5127085093302464
the steamily equatorial to the temperate. The hospitals contain patients    1.5636360329510388
trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars. To make one    1.6432600607208703
nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any    1.67495327387791
case; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have    1.67495327387791
done, or failed to do, in the Congo since 1885.   At first the    1.67495327387791
Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property.    1.6065767145351917
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience.    1.6432600607208703
The Belgian government itself took over administration, commencing    1.4513752902486308
a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism.    1.5636360329510388
One definition of paternalism is "The principle or practice,    1.5127085093302464
on the part of a government, of managing the affairs of a country in    1.7026049541338664
the manner of a father dealing with his children". The honor of the    1.67495327387791
Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned- only their judgment.    1.6432600607208703
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time-    1.6432600607208703
but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child,    1.6065767145351917
if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was 52 and had until    1.7269387314284994
The Belgians were interested    1.0
primarily in the economic development of the Congo, which is rich in    1.6432600607208703
copper, tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton and palm    1.6065767145351917
oil. The colony was administered from Brussels, with neither the    1.5636360329510388
Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote. The beneficiaries    1.5636360329510388
of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both    1.6432600607208703
individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock. In <Inside    1.5636360329510388
Africa>, John Gunther describes one of these, the Societe Generale,    1.5636360329510388
as "the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if, let us    1.6432600607208703
say, the House of Morgan, Anaconda Copper, the Mutual Life Insurance    1.6065767145351917
Company of New York, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and various    1.5127085093302464
companies producing agricultural products were lumped together, with    1.4513752902486308
the United States <government> as a heavy partner".   Had    1.5127085093302464
they been truly ruthless, the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese    1.6065767145351917
without compassion. But they were not. They provided a social    1.5636360329510388
security system which covered all their African employes; their program    1.5636360329510388
of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent;    1.6065767145351917
they put much effort into public housing. They also instituted a ration    1.6432600607208703
system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish    1.6432600607208703
their employes with clothing and adequate food. But instead of    1.5636360329510388
delivering the ration- either in actual commodities or in cash- at    1.6065767145351917
intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month, the Belgians felt obliged    1.6432600607208703
to dole it out more often. Would not the children, if they received all    1.7026049541338664
their food on the first day of the month, eat it up immediately, and    1.7026049541338664
later go hungry?   The Belgians also placed great emphasis    1.5127085093302464
on education. During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in    1.67495327387791
the Congo. But almost all the schools were primary. The average Congolese    1.6432600607208703
can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of "<la chatte>"    1.6432600607208703
and "<le chien>" and write his name. Some schools were    1.5636360329510388
technical- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit    1.5636360329510388
the land, and trained many. But they did not believe in widespread    1.6432600607208703
secondary education, much less in college. It was their conviction    1.5636360329510388
that the people should be "brought up together", a grade at a time,    1.67495327387791
until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history,    1.6432600607208703
economics and political science. Indeed, the Belgians discouraged    1.4513752902486308
higher education, fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite    1.5636360329510388
which might cause unrest. When the Congo received its independence    1.5636360329510388
in 1960 there were, among its 13.5 million people, exactly 14 university    1.6432600607208703
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a    1.4513752902486308
colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it? In one large oversimplification,    1.6065767145351917
it might be said that the Belgians felt, far too late, the    1.6432600607208703
gale of nationalism sweeping Africa. They lacked time to prepare    1.5636360329510388
the Congo, as the British and French had prepared their colonies. The    1.6432600607208703
Congolese were clamoring for their independence, even though most    1.5127085093302464
were unsure what it meant; and in Brussels, street crowds shouted,    1.6065767145351917
"<Pas une goutte de sang!>" (Not one drop of blood!). The    1.6065767145351917
Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue;    1.6432600607208703
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted, they would    1.5636360329510388
wash their hands of the mess. It is hard to blame them for this. Yet    1.7269387314284994
there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after    1.6065767145351917
independence for which history may not find them guiltless.    1.5127085093302464
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no    1.6432600607208703
fewer than 120 political parties, or approximately eight for each university    1.6065767145351917
graduate. There were four principal ones. First, there were those    1.5636360329510388
Congolese (among them Joseph Kasavubu) who favored splitting the    1.5127085093302464
country into small independent states, Balkanizing it. Second, there    1.5127085093302464
were those (Moise Tshombe) who favored near-Balkanization, a loose    1.5127085093302464
federalism having a central government of limited authority, with    1.5127085093302464
much power residing in the states. Third, there were those (notably Patrice    1.6432600607208703
Lumumba) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central    1.6065767145351917
government. And fourth, there were moderates who were in no hurry    1.6065767145351917
for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up. However,    1.6432600607208703
the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.   1.5636360329510388
A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation    1.5127085093302464
of the Congo, immediately after independence, was the provincial structure    1.5636360329510388
that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration.    1.6065767145351917
They had divided the Congo into six provinces- Leopoldville,    1.5127085093302464
Kasai, Kivu, Katanga, Equator and Eastern- unfortunately    1.3761581156320553
with little regard for ethnic groupings. Thus some provinces contained    1.5636360329510388
tribes which detested each other, and to them independence meant    1.5636360329510388
an opportunity for war.   The Belgian Congo was granted its independence    1.6065767145351917
with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government:    1.5127085093302464
there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral legislature    1.67495327387791
elected by universal suffrage in the provinces. Well-wishers    1.4513752902486308
around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable    1.6432600607208703
position in the society of nations. If internal frictions arose,    1.5636360329510388
they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army, the <Force    1.6065767145351917
Publique>, which had been trained and was still officered by white    1.6065767145351917
Belgians. The president, Joseph Kasavubu, seemed an able administrator    1.5127085093302464
and the premier, Patrice Lumumba, a reasonable man.   Twenty-four    1.5127085093302464
hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting    1.4513752902486308
each other. Presently the well-armed members of the <Force Publique>-    1.5636360329510388
many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes,    1.5636360329510388
erupted in mutiny, rioting, raping and looting. Terror engulfed the thousands    1.6065767145351917
of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country. The Belgian    1.6065767145351917
government decided to act, and on July 10 dispatched paratroops    1.5636360329510388
to the Congo. On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of    1.67495327387791
Katanga, Moise Tshombe, announced that his province had seceded from    1.5636360329510388
the country. Confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought    1.5127085093302464
new acts of violence. Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military    1.67495327387791
intervention by the Belgians, and appealed to the United Nations    1.5636360329510388
On July 14 the Security    1.1606783668269585
Council-    1.0
with France and Great Britain abstaining- voted the resolution    1.5127085093302464
which drew the U&N& into the Congo. Vague in wording, it    1.6065767145351917
called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General    1.5636360329510388
"to take the necessary steps **h to provide the [Congolese]    1.5636360329510388
Government with such military assistance as may be necessary, until,    1.5636360329510388
through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical    1.5636360329510388
assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces    1.5127085093302464
may be able, in the opinion of the Government, to meet fully their tasks    1.7026049541338664
**h".   Secretary-General Hammarskjo^ld decided that it    1.2818970554302986
would be preferable if the U&N& troops sent into the Congo were    1.6432600607208703
to come from African, or at least nonwhite, nations- certainly not    1.6065767145351917
from the U&S&,    1.0
Russia, Great Britain or France. He quickly    1.3761581156320553
called on Ghana, Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea and Mali, which dispatched    1.5636360329510388
troops within hours. Ultimately the U&N& army in the Congo    1.5636360329510388
reached a top strength of 19,000, including about 5,000 from India    1.6065767145351917
and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden, who were the only whites.   1.67495327387791
It took the U&N& three months to bring a modest form of    1.6432600607208703
order to the Congo. The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops    1.6432600607208703
and often obstructed U&N& efforts. The wildly erratic nature    1.5127085093302464
of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems- he frequently announced    1.5127085093302464
that he wanted the U&N& to get out of the Congo along with    1.67495327387791
the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help. (However, there is    1.6065767145351917
little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist. Before appealing    1.6065767145351917
to the U&N& or to Russia, he first appealed to the U&S&    1.6432600607208703
for military help, and was rejected.) Lumumba further complicated    1.5127085093302464
the U&N&'s mission by initiating small "wars" with the    1.5127085093302464
secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under    1.5636360329510388
Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well. Meanwhile Russia took every    1.6065767145351917
opportunity to meddle in the Congo, sending Lumumba equipment for    1.5636360329510388
his "wars", dispatching "technicians" and even threatening,    1.3761581156320553
on occasion, to intervene openly.   But by the end of the three-month    1.6432600607208703
period, in October 1960, something approaching calm settled on    1.5127085093302464
the Congo. President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and    1.5127085093302464
fired him. Lumumba fired Kasavubu. Control of the government- such    1.5636360329510388
control as there was and such government as there was- passed into    1.6432600607208703
the hands of Joseph Mobutu, chief of staff of the Congolese army.    1.6432600607208703
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians, who have not since played any    1.6432600607208703
significant part on the local scene, although they have redoubled their    1.6065767145351917
obstructionist efforts at U&N& headquarters in New York.    1.4513752902486308
The Belgians- at least officially- departed from the Congo as well,    1.6065767145351917
withdrawing all of their uniformed troops. But they left behind    1.5636360329510388
them large numbers of officers, variously called "volunteers" or    1.5127085093302464
"mercenaries", who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga,    1.6065767145351917
the seceded province which, according to Tshombe, holds 65% of    1.5636360329510388
the mineral wealth of the entire country.   From October 1960    1.5636360329510388
to February 1961, the U&N& forces in the Congo took little action.    1.6432600607208703
There was no directive for it- the Security Council's resolution    1.5636360329510388
had not mentioned political matters, and in any case the United    1.6065767145351917
Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political    1.67495327387791
affairs of any nation, whether to unify it, federalize it or Balkanize    1.6432600607208703
it.   During the five-month lull, civil war smoldered and    1.5127085093302464
flickered throughout the Congo. In February the murder of Patrice    1.5636360329510388
Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of    1.6432600607208703
Tshombe, again stirred the U&N& to action. On Feb& 21 the    1.6065767145351917
council passed another resolution urging the taking of "all appropriate    1.5636360329510388
measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo, including    1.6432600607208703
**h the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort". Although    1.6432600607208703
the resolution might have been far more specific, it was considerably    1.6065767145351917
tougher than the earlier one. It also urged that the U&N&    1.6065767145351917
eject, and prevent the return of, all Belgian and other foreign military    1.6432600607208703
and political advisers; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's    1.4513752902486308
death; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the    1.5636360329510388
reorganization of the army.    1.0
Though President John    1.0
F& Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin    1.6065767145351917
and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev,    1.4513752902486308
his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved    1.5127085093302464
him in other key problems of U&S& foreign policy last week.   1.6065767145351917
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question    1.6065767145351917
of Bizerte. On this issue, the President received a detailed    1.5636360329510388
report from his U&N& Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, who had just    1.5636360329510388
returned from Paris, and Mr& Kennedy asked Stevenson to search    1.5636360329510388
for a face-saving    1.0
way- for both Paris and Tunis- out of the imbroglio.    1.5636360329510388
Ideally, the President would like the French to agree on a "status    1.6432600607208703
quo ante" on Bizerte, and accept a new timetable for withdrawing    1.6065767145351917
their forces from the Mediterranean base. To continue their important    1.5636360329510388
conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of    1.5636360329510388
other problems, Mr& Kennedy invited stevenson to Cape Cod for    1.5636360329510388
the weekend.   1.0
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with    1.4513752902486308
the No& 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense Minister Bahi    1.6065767145351917
Ladgham, who flew to Washington last week to seek U&S& support.    1.6065767145351917
The conversation apparently convinced Mr& Kennedy that the    1.4513752902486308
positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable. Through Ladgham,    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian    1.5636360329510388
President Habib Bourguiba; and one U&S& official said: "The    1.5127085093302464
key question now is which side picks up the phone first".   1.6065767145351917
On the Latin American front, the President held talks with Secretary    1.6065767145351917
of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay    1.5636360329510388
and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (which the President    1.5636360329510388
himself had originally hoped to attend). Main purpose of the    1.5636360329510388
meeting: To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress.   1.4513752902486308
And that was not all. In conferences with Nationalist China's    1.5636360329510388
dapper, diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng, Mr& Kennedy    1.4513752902486308
assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U&S& is as    1.5127085093302464
firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United    1.67495327387791
Nations. Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission    1.6065767145351917
of Outer Mongolia; however the President, who would like to woo    1.6065767145351917
the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow, would    1.6065767145351917
promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U&S& if Outer    1.6432600607208703
Mongolia's admission comes to a vote.   The President    1.4513752902486308
also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking    1.6065767145351917
more foreign aid. To Africa, he sent his most trusted adviser,    1.6065767145351917
his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on a good-will mission    1.5636360329510388
to the Ivory Coast. All week long the President clearly was playing    1.6432600607208703
a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect, he was practicing    1.6432600607208703
what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he    1.6432600607208703
declared:    1.0
"We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems    1.5127085093302464
with any and all nations that are willing to talk, and listen, with    1.67495327387791
reason".    1.0
From International Airport    1.0
in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston, as the    1.5636360329510388
great four-jet Boeing 707 flies, is a routine five hours and 25 minutes,    1.67495327387791
including stopovers at Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio. When    1.5636360329510388
Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one    1.5636360329510388
night last week, there was no reason to think it would take any longer.   1.7026049541338664
The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a&m& in Phoenix.    1.6065767145351917
Thirty-one minutes later, when it took off for El Paso, hardly    1.6065767145351917
anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention    1.7026049541338664
to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard. At 3:58 a&m&,    1.67495327387791
with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso, passenger Robert    1.6432600607208703
Berry, a San Antonio advertising man, glanced up and saw the    1.6065767145351917
man and boy, accompanied by a stewardess, walking up the aisle toward    1.6432600607208703
the cockpit. "The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach",    1.67495327387791
Berry said. "I figured he was sick".   John Salvador, a    1.5636360329510388
farmer from Palm Desert, Calif&, was sitting up front and could    1.6065767145351917
see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit. "The kid had    1.67495327387791
a .45 automatic, like they issue in the Army", he said. "The other    1.67495327387791
fellow had a .38". Salvador saw the youth hold his .45 against the    1.67495327387791
head of stewardess Lois Carnegey; the man put his .38 at the head    1.67495327387791
of Capt& Byron D& Rickards.   To Rickards, a 52-year-old    1.5127085093302464
veteran 30 years in the air, it was an old story: His plane was    1.7026049541338664
being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930, when    1.67495327387791
Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa. But    1.6065767145351917
last week's pirates, like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked    1.5127085093302464
an Eastern Airlines Electra (NEWSWEEK, Aug& 7), wanted to    1.5127085093302464
go to Havana. _STALLING:_ "Tell your company there are four    1.5636360329510388
of us here    1.0
with guns", the elder man told Rickards. The pilot radioed    1.5636360329510388
El Paso International Airport with just that message. But, he    1.5636360329510388
told the "skyjackers", the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach    1.6065767145351917
Havana; they would have to refuel at El Paso.   Most passengers    1.6065767145351917
didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground.    1.6065767145351917
Jerry McCauley of Sacramento, Calif&, one of some twenty Air Force    1.6065767145351917
recruits on board, awoke from a nap in confusion. "The old man    1.6432600607208703
came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers    1.67495327387791
to go to Cuba", McCauley said, "and like a nut I raised my hand.    1.7026049541338664
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter".   What the man    1.6065767145351917
wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages, along with the crew.    1.6432600607208703
They chose four: Jack Casey, who works for Continental Airlines    1.5636360329510388
in Houston; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island, Wash&;    1.4513752902486308
Pfc&    1.0
Truman Cleveland of St& Augustine. Fla&, and Leonard Gilman,    1.5127085093302464
a former college boxer and veteran of the U&S& Immigration    1.5636360329510388
Service Border Patrol. Everybody else was allowed to file off the    1.6065767145351917
plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a&m&.    1.6065767145351917
They found a large welcoming group- El Paso policemen, Border Patrol,    1.6065767145351917
sheriff's deputies, and ~FBI men, who surged around the    1.5127085093302464
plane with rifles and submarine guns. Other ~FBI men, talking with    1.6065767145351917
the pilot from the tower, conspired with him to delay the proposed    1.6432600607208703
flight to Havana. The ground crew, which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty    1.67495327387791
minutes, took fully three hours. Still more time was consumed while    1.6065767145351917
the pilot, at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert    1.5636360329510388
Six, tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for    1.67495327387791
a propeller-driven Douglas ~DC-7.   Actually, the officers    1.3761581156320553
on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with    1.67495327387791
any kind of an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight    1.6432600607208703
from President Kennedy, who thought at first, as did most others, that    1.6432600607208703
it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over    1.6432600607208703
the 707. Mr& Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the    1.67495327387791
attempt to steal the plane, kept in touch throughout by telephone. At    1.6432600607208703
one time, while still under the impression that he was dealing with a    1.67495327387791
Cuban plot, the President talked about invoking a total embargo on    1.6065767145351917
trade with Cuba.   As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas    1.67495327387791
sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains, police got close    1.6065767145351917
enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment. From the    1.6432600607208703
luggage, they learned that the two air pirates, far from being Cubans,    1.6432600607208703
were native Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden,    1.4513752902486308
50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz&, and his son, Cody,    1.5127085093302464
16, a high-school junior. _TENSION_ The heat and strain began    1.5636360329510388
to tell on the Beardens. The father, by accident or perhaps to show,    1.67495327387791
as he said, "we mean business", took the .45 and fired a slug    1.67495327387791
between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons. At 7:30 a&m&,    1.6065767145351917
more than three hours after landing, the Beardens gave an ultimatum:   1.6065767145351917
Take off or see the hostages killed.   The tower    1.5127085093302464
cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a&m&, and Captain Rickards    1.6065767145351917
began taxiing toward the runway.   Several police cars, loaded with    1.5636360329510388
armed officers, raced alongside, blazing away at the tires of the    1.6065767145351917
big jet. The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard    1.67495327387791
engines; the plane slowed to a halt. Ambulances, baggage trucks,    1.5636360329510388
and cars surrounded it.   The day wore on. At 12:50 p&m&    1.6065767145351917
a ramp was rolled up to the plane. A few minutes later, ~FBI agent    1.7026049541338664
Francis Crosby, talking fast, eased up the ramp to the plane, unarmed.    1.6432600607208703
While Crosby distracted the Beardens, stewardesses Carnegey    1.3761581156320553
and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door. So did hostages Casey,    1.67495327387791
Cleveland, and Mullen. That left only the four crew members, Crosby,    1.6065767145351917
and Border Patrolman Gilman, all unarmed, with the Beardens.    1.5127085093302464
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand, the other in a hip pocket.    1.7269387314284994
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance. He caught    1.6432600607208703
officer Simmons' eye, nodded toward young Bearden, and- "I    1.5127085093302464
swung my right as hard as I could. Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy    1.7026049541338664
and it was all over".   Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48    1.6065767145351917
p&m&, the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges    1.6432600607208703
of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines.    1.5636360329510388
(Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro, and live high    1.6432600607208703
in Cuba.) Back home in Coolidge, Ariz&, his 36-year-old wife,    1.5636360329510388
Mary, said: "I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for    1.6432600607208703
jobs".    1.0
Taking precedence over all other    1.1606783668269585
legislation on    1.0
Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of    1.5127085093302464
the nation. The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed    1.67495327387791
speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0- the largest peacetime    1.6065767145351917
defense budget in U&S& history.   With the money all    1.5127085093302464
but in hand, however, the Administration indicated that, instead of    1.5636360329510388
the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested,    1.6065767145351917
the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000. The "hold-back",    1.6065767145351917
as Pentagon mutterers labeled it, apparently was a temporary    1.5127085093302464
expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually    1.6432600607208703
and, thus, the new funds spent prudently.   In all, the Senate    1.6065767145351917
signed a check for $46.7 billion, which not only included the extra    1.6432600607208703
$3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy, but    1.5636360329510388
tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for. (The    1.6432600607208703
Senate, on its own, decided to provide additional ~B-52 and other    1.6065767145351917
long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command.) The House, which    1.5636360329510388
had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent    1.5127085093302464
call for more, was expected to go along with the increased defense    1.6432600607208703
budget in short order.   In other areas, Congressional action last    1.5636360329510388
week included:   @ The Senate (by voice vote) and the House    1.5636360329510388
(by 224-170) passed and sent to the White House the compromise    1.6065767145351917
farm bill which the President is expected to sign, not too unhappily.   1.6432600607208703
@ The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's    1.5636360329510388
health, welfare, and labor activities.   Debate on the    1.4513752902486308
all-important foreign-aid    1.0
bill, with its controversial long-range proposals,    1.2818970554302986
had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend. White House    1.6432600607208703
legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.    1.5636360329510388
Most members of the U&S& Senate,    1.2818970554302986
because they are human, like to eat as high on the hog as they    1.7026049541338664
can. But, because they are politicians, they like to talk as poor-mouth    1.6432600607208703
as the lowliest voter. As a result, ever since 1851 when the Senate    1.67495327387791
restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building, the senators    1.6432600607208703
have never ceased to grumble about the food- even while they    1.6065767145351917
opposed every move that might improve it.   Over the years, enlivened    1.6065767145351917
chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho    1.6065767145351917
potatoes, the menu has pursued its drab all-American course. Individual    1.5636360329510388
senators, with an eye to the voters back home, occasionally introduced    1.6065767145351917
smelts from Michigan, soft-shell crabs from Maryland, oysters    1.4513752902486308
from Washington, grapefruit from Florida. But plain old bean soup,    1.5636360329510388
served daily    1.0
since the turn of the century (at the insistence of the    1.6065767145351917
late Sen& Fred Dubois of Idaho), made clear to the citizenry that    1.6432600607208703
the Senate's stomach was in the right place.   In a daring    1.6065767145351917
stroke, the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute    1.6432600607208703
cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel.   1.4513752902486308
{Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly    1.5127085093302464
reports on operation of the turnpikes}.   {Long-term trend    1.4513752902486308
of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward. Higher toll rates    1.6065767145351917
also are helping boost revenues}.   {Result is a better prospect    1.5636360329510388
for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative}.   1.67495327387791
Things are looking up these days for many of the    1.5636360329510388
State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road    1.6065767145351917
bonds.   traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.    1.5636360329510388
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll    1.6432600607208703
gates.   As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes, investors    1.6065767145351917
who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright    1.5636360329510388
speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.   1.5127085093302464
Another    1.0
result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these    1.67495327387791
tax-exempt bonds.   Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local    1.5127085093302464
governments hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard    1.6065767145351917
+ Poor's average. On balance, prices of those bonds have slipped    1.5636360329510388
a bit since then. However, in the same three-month period, toll-road    1.6065767145351917
bonds, as a group, have bucked this trend. On these bonds, price rises    1.67495327387791
since February 21 easily outnumber price declines.    1.3761581156320553
Investors, however, still see an element of more-than-ordinary    1.4513752902486308
risk in the toll-road bonds. You find the evidence of that in the    1.67495327387791
chart on this page.   Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling    1.6432600607208703
at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent,    1.7026049541338664
or very close to that. And this is true in the case of some turnpikes    1.7269387314284994
on which revenues have risen close to, or beyond, the point at which    1.67495327387791
the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on    1.6432600607208703
the bonds.   That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be    1.7026049541338664
had on good corporation bonds. It's not much more, in fact, than    1.6432600607208703
the return that is offered on U& S& Treasury bonds.   For    1.6065767145351917
investors whose income is taxed at high rates, though, a tax-free yield    1.6432600607208703
of 4 per cent is high. It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried    1.7677783654484436
investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for    1.6432600607208703
a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income.    1.5636360329510388
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the    1.6432600607208703
most recent 12-month period- ending in February or March- shows    1.5636360329510388
what is happening. The report is based on a survey by Blyth + Company,    1.67495327387791
investment bankers.   Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in    1.5127085093302464
net revenues during the period.   And there is the bright note:    1.6065767145351917
The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late    1.6432600607208703
in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession. Many    1.67495327387791
of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.   Indication:    1.6432600607208703
The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.   Look,    1.5127085093302464
for example, at the Ohio Turnpike. Traffic on that road slumped    1.6065767145351917
sharply in January and February, as compared with those same months    1.6065767145351917
in 1960. Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues-    1.67495327387791
after operating costs.   As a result, the road's net revenues    1.5636360329510388
in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest    1.7269387314284994
payments on the turnpike bonds. That was up from 173 per cent    1.6432600607208703
in the preceding 12 months.   That same pattern of earnings shows    1.6065767145351917
up on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Operating revenues were off in    1.5636360329510388
the first three months of 1961, but up for the 12 months ending in March.    1.7269387314284994
Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.   For the    1.5636360329510388
year, the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs, against 121    1.67495327387791
per cent in the preceding period. The road's engineers look for further    1.6432600607208703
improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston.    1.4513752902486308
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough    1.5636360329510388
to prove what they can do. The 187-mile Illinois State Toll    1.6065767145351917
Highway,    1.0
for example, was not opened over its entire length until December, 1958.    1.6432600607208703
In the 12 months ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough    1.6432600607208703
to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the remainder paid    1.67495327387791
out of initial reserves. In the 12 months ended in February, 1961,    1.6432600607208703
this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest.   That improvement    1.6065767145351917
is continuing. In the first two months of 1961, earnings of the    1.6432600607208703
Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent    1.6065767145351917
from early 1960.   Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard.    1.5636360329510388
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates.    1.6065767145351917
In these cases, the turnpike managements have had to turn to    1.6065767145351917
toll-rate increases, or to costly improvements such as extensions or    1.5636360329510388
better    1.0
connections with other highways.   Many rate increases already    1.4513752902486308
have been put into effect. Higher tolls are planned for July 1,    1.6432600607208703
1961, on the Richmond-Petersburg, Va&, Turnpike, and proposals for    1.5127085093302464
increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study.    1.5127085093302464
Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists' access    1.5127085093302464
to many turnpikes. The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration.    1.5127085093302464
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements    1.67495327387791
in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb& 28,    1.7026049541338664
1961.   Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike    1.5127085093302464
are expected late in 1961, with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita,    1.7026049541338664
and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in    1.5636360329510388
both Kansas City, Kans&, and Kansas City, Mo&. Meanwhile, there    1.5636360329510388
appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover    1.6432600607208703
the interest deficiency for eight more years.    1.3761581156320553
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find    1.4513752902486308
that not all roads are nearing their goals.   Traffic and revenues    1.6065767145351917
on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners    1.6065767145351917
and investors alike. If nothing is done, the prospect is that that    1.6432600607208703
road will be in default of interest in 1962. West Virginia toll bonds    1.67495327387791
have defaulted in interest for months, and, despite recent improvement    1.5636360329510388
in revenues, holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.   1.67495327387791
These, however, are exceptions. The typical picture at this    1.5127085093302464
time is one of steady improvement.   It's going to take time    1.6065767145351917
for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in    1.7026049541338664
full. Already, however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough    1.5636360329510388
to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins. Many others are    1.5636360329510388
attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even    1.6065767145351917
point.    1.0

reducing wages, Underwood's production costs were cut one third,    1.5127085093302464
prices were slashed. The result has been that exports of Underwood    1.6065767145351917
products have doubled.   "The Olivetti plant near Turin has    1.5127085093302464

ways of handling competitive imports.   The recently unveiled    1.4513752902486308
<Kennedy moves to control the international textile market> can be    1.5636360329510388
significant for American businessmen in many lines.   <Important    1.4513752902486308
aspects> of the Kennedy textile plans are these:   <An    1.5127085093302464
international conference> of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting    1.4513752902486308
countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy.   1.4513752902486308
<Chief aims of the proposed conference> are worth noting.   1.5127085093302464
The U&S& will try to get agreement among the industrialized    1.5636360329510388
countries to <take more textile imports> from the less-developed    1.5127085093302464
countries over the years.   <Point is> that developing countries    1.5127085093302464
often build up a textile industry first, need encouragement to    1.5636360329510388
get on their feet. If they have trouble exporting, international bill    1.6065767145351917
for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.   <Idea    1.6065767145351917
is> to let these countries earn their way as much as possible.    1.6432600607208703
@ At the same time, <another purpose> of the conference    1.5127085093302464
will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports-    1.6065767145351917
especially dumping of specific products- to high-wage textile-producing    1.4513752902486308
countries.   <Japan,> since 1957, has been "voluntarily"    1.3761581156320553
curbing exports of textiles to the U&S&. <Hong Kong,    1.5127085093302464
India and Pakistan> have been limiting exports of certain types    1.5636360329510388
of textiles to Britain for several years under the "Lancashire Pact".   1.6065767145351917
None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.   1.5127085093302464
<The Japanese want to increase exports to the U&S&>    1.5127085093302464
While they have been curbing shipments, they have watched Hong Kong    1.6065767145351917
step in and capture an expanding share of the big U&S& market.   1.6432600607208703
<Hong Kong interests> loudly protest limiting their exports    1.4513752902486308
to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into    1.5127085093302464
British market unrestrictedly.   <The Indians and Pakistanis>    1.3761581156320553
are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for    1.5636360329510388
similar reasons.   <The Kennedy hope> is that, at the conference    1.5636360329510388
or through bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries    1.4513752902486308
in Asia and Europe will see that "dumping" practices cause    1.5636360329510388
friction all around and may result in import quotas.   <Gradual,    1.5636360329510388
controlled expansion> of the world's textile trade is what President    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy wants. This may point the way toward international stabilization    1.5636360329510388
agreements in other products. <It's an important clue    1.4513752902486308
@ Note, too, that the Kennedy    1.1606783668269585
textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U&S&    1.5636360329510388
textile industry.   <"Get competitive or get out".> In    1.4513752902486308
veiled terms, that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to    1.5636360329510388
the American textile industry. <The Government will help> in    1.5127085093302464
transferring companies and workers into new lines, where modernization    1.5127085093302464
doesn't seem feasible. <Special depreciation> on new textile machinery    1.5127085093302464
may be allowed. <Government research> will look into new    1.5127085093302464
products and methods.   <Import quotas aren't ruled out>    1.4513752902486308
where the national interest is involved.   But the Kennedy Administration    1.5636360329510388
<doesn't favor> import quotas. Rather, they are impressed    1.4513752902486308
with the British Government's success in forcing- and helping-    1.5127085093302464
the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to    1.6065767145351917
other products.   What's happening in textiles can be <handwriting    1.5127085093302464

@ Among the highest-paid workers    1.0
in the world are U&S& coal miners. Yet U&S& coal is    1.6065767145351917
cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water.   <Steel    1.5127085093302464
Company of Wales,> a British steelmaker, wants to bring in    1.5636360329510388
Virginia coal, cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be    1.7026049541338664
able to compete more effectively- especially in foreign markets.   1.5127085093302464
<Virginia coal,> delivered by ship in Wales, will be about    1.5636360329510388
$2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.   1.67495327387791
<U&S& coal is cheap,> despite high wages, because    1.4513752902486308
of widespread mechanization of mines, wide coal seams, attactive rates    1.5636360329510388
on ocean freight. Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British    1.6432600607208703
mines are twisting, narrow and very deep.   <Productivity    1.4513752902486308
of U&S& miners> is twice that of the British.   <Welsh    1.5636360329510388
coal miners,> Communist-led, are up in arms at the suggestion that    1.6065767145351917
the steel company bring in American coal. They threaten to strike.   1.6065767145351917
The British Government will have to decide whether to let    1.5636360329510388
U&S& coal in. The British coal industry is unprofitable, has large    1.6065767145351917
coal stocks it can't sell.   1.1606783668269585
EVERY library borrower, or at least those whose taste goes    1.5636360329510388
beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows what it is to hear the librarian    1.67495327387791
say apologetically, "I'm sorry, but we don't have that    1.5127085093302464
book. There wouldn't be much demand for it, I'm afraid".   1.5636360329510388
Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the ever-present budget    1.6065767145351917
problem all libraries must face, from the largest to the smallest.    1.6065767145351917
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles?    1.67495327387791
What to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction and    1.67495327387791
nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified, when    1.5636360329510388
your budget is pitifully small? Most library budgets are hopelessly    1.5636360329510388
inadequate. A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually,    1.5636360329510388
which includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New    1.5636360329510388
York Public has enough money to meet its needs- this in the world's    1.67495327387791
richest city. The plight of a small community library is proportionately    1.6065767145351917
worse.   Confronted with this situation, most libraries    1.3761581156320553
either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they    1.6432600607208703
can with what they have, or else depend on the bounty of patrons and    1.7026049541338664
local governments to supplement their annual funds. In some parts of    1.6065767145351917
the country, however, a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under    1.6065767145351917
the wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial help of the    1.6432600607208703
state, libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional    1.6065767145351917
basis.   New York State has what is probably the most advanced    1.6065767145351917
of these co-operative systems, so well developed that it has become    1.6065767145351917
a model for others to follow. Because it is so large a state, with    1.7026049541338664
marked contrasts in population density, the organization of the New    1.5636360329510388
York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works. At    1.6065767145351917
one extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where libraries    1.6432600607208703
in two or more counties combine to serve a large, sparsely populated    1.6432600607208703
area. At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library    1.6432600607208703
System, in a high-density area, with ample resources and a rapidly    1.6065767145351917
growing territory to serve.   Both these types, and those    1.5127085093302464
in between, are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries    1.67495327387791
that began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation by the    1.67495327387791
legislature of county library systems financed by county governments    1.5127085093302464
with matching funds from the state. It was a step in the right direction,    1.7026049541338664
but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully    1.6432600607208703
the thriving systems of today.   Under this law annual grants are    1.6065767145351917
given to systems in substantial amounts. An earlier difficulty was    1.5636360329510388
overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might    1.6432600607208703
join or not, as they saw fit. Some library boards are wary of the    1.7026049541338664
plan. A large, well-stocked library, surrounded in a county by smaller    1.6065767145351917
ones, may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too    1.7026049541338664
great.  A small library may cherish its independence and established    1.5636360329510388
ways, and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems    1.6065767145351917
radical to older members of the board.   Within a system, however,    1.6065767145351917
the autonomy of each member library is preserved. The local community    1.6065767145351917
maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library    1.5636360329510388
program, facilities, and services, but wider resources and additional    1.5127085093302464
services become available through membership in a system. All    1.5127085093302464
services are given without cost to members. So obvious are these advantages    1.6432600607208703
that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State    1.6432600607208703
now has access to a system, and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day,    1.6432600607208703
not too distant, when all the libraries in the state will belong to    1.67495327387791
TO SET up a co-operative library system, the law    1.5127085093302464
requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as    1.5636360329510388
the nucleus, and the system is organized around it. The collection may    1.6432600607208703
be in an existing library, or it may be built up in a central collection.    1.7269387314284994
Each system develops differently, according to the area it serves,    1.5636360329510388
but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for    1.7026049541338664
maximum efficiency. The basic state grant is thirty cents for each    1.6065767145351917
person served, and there is a further book incentive grant that provides    1.6432600607208703
an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if a library spends    1.7026049541338664
a certain number of dollars.   In Nassau County, for example,    1.5636360329510388
the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City, the    1.6065767145351917
system is credited by the state with serving one million persons, a figure    1.67495327387791
that has doubled since 1950. This system, by virtue of its variety    1.6432600607208703
and size, offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation.   1.6065767145351917
The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference    1.6432600607208703
service, what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge,    1.5636360329510388
and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area. The    1.6065767145351917
need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual    1.6432600607208703
libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday needs, could afford. Nassau    1.5127085093302464
is currently building a central collection of reference materials    1.5127085093302464
in its Hempstead headquarters, which will reach its goal of 100,000    1.6065767145351917
volumes by 1965.   The major part of this collection is in the    1.6432600607208703
central headquarters building, and the remainder is divided among five    1.5636360329510388
libraries in the system designated as subject centers. Basic    1.5127085093302464
reference    1.0
tools are the backbone of the collection, but there is also specialization    1.6432600607208703
in science and technology, an indicated weakness in local libraries.    1.5636360329510388
On microfilm, headquarters also has a file of the <New York    1.6065767145351917
Times> from its founding in 1851 to the present day, as well as bound    1.7026049541338664
volumes of important periodicals. The entire headquarters collection    1.4513752902486308
is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.   1.6065767145351917
Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day. It is connected    1.5636360329510388
by teletype with the State Library in Albany, which will supply any    1.6432600607208703
book to a system that the system itself cannot provide. The books are    1.67495327387791
carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other    1.6432600607208703
libraries.   Each subject center library was chosen because    1.4513752902486308
of its demonstrated strength in a particular area, which headquarters    1.5636360329510388
could then build upon. East Meadow has philosophy, psychology, and    1.5636360329510388
religion; Freeport houses social science, pure science, and language;    1.5127085093302464
history, biography, and education are centered in Hempstead; Levittown    1.5127085093302464
has applied science, business, and literature; while Hewlett-Woodmere    1.4513752902486308
is the repository of art, music, and foreign languages.    1.5127085093302464
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant,    1.5636360329510388
and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen    1.67495327387791
local reference service.   This kind of cooperation is not    1.5127085093302464
wholly new, of course. Public libraries in Nassau County have been    1.6065767145351917
lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century, but the system    1.67495327387791
enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive    1.6432600607208703
basis. Local libraries find, too, that the new plan saves    1.5636360329510388
tax dollars because books can be bought through the system, and since    1.6432600607208703
the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would    1.7026049541338664
be available to an individual library. The system passes on these    1.6065767145351917
savings to its members. Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping    1.6432600607208703
and clerical detail as the result of central billing.   1.5127085093302464
Books are not the only resource of the system. Schools and community    1.6432600607208703
groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary, art,    1.5636360329510388
and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs,    1.6065767145351917
and to organizations in member communities. The most recent film    1.5636360329510388
catalogue, available at each library, lists 110 titles presently in the    1.6065767145351917
collection, any of which may be borrowed without charge. This catalogue    1.6065767145351917
lists separately films suitable for children, young adults, or adults,    1.5636360329510388
although some classics cut across age groups, such as "Nanook    1.5636360329510388
of the North", "The Emperor's Nightingale", and "The    1.4513752902486308
Red Balloon". Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual    1.5127085093302464
consultant for the staffs of member libraries, teaching them the effective    1.6065767145351917
use of film as a library service.   The system well understands    1.6065767145351917
that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children    1.5636360329510388
and books together; consequently an experienced children's librarian    1.4513752902486308
at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned    1.5636360329510388
library activities, cooperating with the children's librarians    1.3761581156320553
in member libraries by means of individual conferences, workshops,    1.5127085093302464
and frequent visits. Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile    1.6065767145351917
book-review and book-selection center, to provide better methods of    1.5127085093302464
purchasing and selection. Sample copies of new books are on display    1.6065767145351917
at headquarters, where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in    1.6065767145351917
workshop groups. Story hours, pre-school programs, activities with    1.4513752902486308
community agencies, and lists of recommended reading are all in the province    1.6432600607208703
of the children's consultant.   Headquarters of the Nassau    1.4513752902486308
system is an increasingly busy place these days, threatening to expand    1.6065767145351917
beyond its boundaries. In addition to the interlibrary loan service    1.5636360329510388
and the children's program, headquarters has a public relations    1.5127085093302464
director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library    1.6065767145351917
service in the county; it prepares cooperative displays (posters,    1.5127085093302464
booklists, brochures, and other promotional material) for use in member    1.5636360329510388
libraries; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays    1.5636360329510388
already created and used; and it publishes <Sum and Substance>,    1.5636360329510388
a monthly newsletter, which reports the system's activities to    1.5127085093302464
the staffs and trustees of member libraries. The system itself is governed    1.6432600607208703
by a board of trustees, geographically representing its membership.   1.5127085093302464
In Nassau, as in other systems, the long-range objective    1.5127085093302464
is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools, and    1.7026049541338664
on adult education in general. Librarians, a patient breed of men    1.6065767145351917
and women who have borne much with dedication, can begin to see results    1.67495327387791
today. Library use is multiplying daily, and the bulk of the newcomers    1.6432600607208703
are those maligned Americans, the teen-agers. To them especially    1.5127085093302464
the librarians, with the help of co-ops, hope they will never have to    1.67495327387791
say, "I'm sorry, we don't have that book".   1.4513752902486308
TODAY, more than ever before, the survival of our free society    1.6065767145351917
depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned. The    1.6065767145351917
great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our    1.6432600607208703
own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western    1.6065767145351917
world. The need for lifetime reading is apparent. Education must not    1.6065767145351917
be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our    1.67495327387791
entire lives, for it is only through knowledge that we, as a nation,    1.67495327387791
can cope with the dangers that threaten our society.   The desire    1.6065767145351917
and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life. We    1.6432600607208703
cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read; if we are not    1.67495327387791
discriminating in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we    1.7026049541338664
do read. We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific    1.7269387314284994
age, as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint    1.6065767145351917
that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom    1.6065767145351917
absorbed from the written word.   A fundamental source of knowledge    1.5636360329510388
in the world today is the book found in our libraries. Although    1.6432600607208703
progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still    1.6065767145351917
falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that    1.7026049541338664
are needed for an informed America. The problem grows in intensity    1.6065767145351917
each year as man's knowledge, and his capacity to translate such knowledge    1.6432600607208703
to the written word, continue to expand. The inadequacy of our    1.6065767145351917
library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct    1.6065767145351917
this condition. There are, for example, approximately 25,000,000    1.4513752902486308
people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000    1.6432600607208703
with inadequate service. In college libraries, 57 per cent of the    1.6065767145351917
total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed    1.6432600607208703
last year by the U&S& Office of Education. And over 66 per    1.6432600607208703
cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any    1.7026049541338664
IN every aspect of service- to the public,    1.4513752902486308
to children in schools, to colleges and universities- the library    1.5636360329510388
of today is failing to render vitally needed services. Only public    1.6065767145351917
understanding and support can provide that service.   This is    1.5127085093302464
one of the main reasons for National Library Week, April 16-22, and    1.6432600607208703
for its theme: "For a richer, fuller life, read"!    1.5127085093302464
The General Assembly, which    1.0
adjourns today, has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle    1.6065767145351917
from the day it convened. It was faced immediately with a showdown    1.6432600607208703
on the schools, an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the    1.67495327387791
governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.   1.5636360329510388
There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight, in    1.5127085093302464
which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers. The    1.5636360329510388
final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening    1.7026049541338664
budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information    1.3761581156320553
they need.   Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance    1.5636360329510388
them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid    1.7269387314284994
crisis-to-crisis government. This session, for instance, may have    1.4513752902486308
insured    1.0
a financial crisis two years from now.   In all the turmoil,    1.6065767145351917
some good legislation was passed. Some other good bills were lost    1.6065767145351917
in the shuffle and await future action. Certainly all can applaud passage    1.6432600607208703
of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase in teacher    1.6432600607208703
pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance by the state of responsibility    1.6432600607208703
for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate    1.6065767145351917
as outside city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and the    1.67495327387791
road maintenance bond issue.   No action has been taken, however,    1.5636360329510388
on such major problems as ending the fee system, penal reform, modification    1.6432600607208703
of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks    1.6065767145351917
sales. Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal    1.6432600607208703
question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.   1.6065767145351917
The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations    1.6432600607208703
questions. Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate    1.5127085093302464
of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like    1.6432600607208703
anything but "the empire state of the South".   We congratulate    1.5636360329510388
the entire membership on its record of good legislation. In the    1.6065767145351917
interim between now and next year, we trust the House and Senate will    1.67495327387791
put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic, fiscal    1.5636360329510388
and social problems and come up with answers without all the political    1.6432600607208703
heroics. @    1.0

affairs", Jefferson said, "you and I, and Congress and assemblies,    1.5636360329510388

its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000 state grant authorized by    1.6432600607208703
Gov& Vandiver, the group expects to sign a contract in March with    1.6432600607208703
Georgia Tech&. Then a full-time planning office will be established    1.5636360329510388
in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research staff    1.6065767145351917
for development of an area planning and industrial development program.   1.5636360329510388
The undertaking has abundant promise. It recognizes the fact    1.5127085093302464
that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding    1.6432600607208703
together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than    1.6065767145351917

The Rusk belief in balanced defense, replacing    1.3761581156320553
the    1.0
Dulles theory of massive retaliation, removes a grave danger that    1.5636360329510388
has existed.   The danger lay not in believing that our own ~A-bombs    1.6432600607208703
would deter Russia's use of hers; that theory was and is    1.6065767145351917
sound. The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence    1.6065767145351917
was enough.   By limiting American strength too much to nuclear    1.5636360329510388
strength, this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war    1.6432600607208703
besides a nuclear war. This strategy heightened the possibility that    1.5636360329510388
we would have a nuclear war.   It also weakened our diplomatic    1.6065767145351917
stance, because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear    1.6432600607208703
war except in the ultimate extremity.   This left the Soviets    1.5636360329510388
plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable    1.5636360329510388
impunity.   By maintaining the nuclear deterrent, but gearing    1.4513752902486308

DeKalb's budget for 1961 is a record    1.3761581156320553
one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.   1.7269387314284994
It includes a raise in the county minimum wage, creation    1.5636360329510388
of several new jobs at the executive level, financing of beefed-up    1.6065767145351917

services such as health and welfare, fire protection, sanitation and    1.5636360329510388

from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase    1.6432600607208703
for the Milledgeville State Hospital.   Actually it amounts    1.4513752902486308
to $1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving, considering    1.5636360329510388
the additional half-million dollars Gov& Vandiver allocated    1.3761581156320553
last year from the state surplus.   Either way it sounds like    1.6065767145351917
a sizable hunk of money and is. But exactly how far it will go toward    1.7269387314284994
improving conditions is another question because there is so much that    1.6065767145351917
needs doing.   The practice of charging employes for meals whether    1.5636360329510388
they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished. The work week    1.67495327387791
of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be    1.7026049541338664
reduced.   More attendants, nurses and doctors should be hired.    1.5127085093302464
Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.   Even with    1.5636360329510388
the increase in funds for the next fiscal year, Georgia will be spending    1.67495327387791
only around $3.15 per day per patient. The national average is    1.6065767145351917
more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental    1.67495327387791
health field to be too low. Kansas, regarded as tops in the nation in    1.7026049541338664
its treatment of the mentally ill, spends $9 per day per patient.   1.6432600607208703
Georgia has made some reforms, true. The intensive treatment program    1.5636360329510388
is working well. But in so many other areas we still are dragging.   1.67495327387791
Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be    1.6065767145351917
done, it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning    1.6432600607208703
toward making the best possible use of the increase granted. The    1.6065767145351917
boost is helpful but inadequate.- @    1.1606783668269585
Assassination, even of a tyrant, is repulsive    1.3761581156320553
to men of good conscience. Rafael Trujillo, the often-blood thirsty    1.5636360329510388
dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years, perhaps deserved    1.5636360329510388
his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history. But whether the murder    1.6432600607208703
of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people    1.6065767145351917
of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.   1.6432600607208703
Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination. The responsibility    1.5127085093302464
for scores of deaths, including the abduction and murder of Jesus    1.6065767145351917
Maria Galindez, a professor at Columbia University in New York,    1.5636360329510388
has been laid at his door. He had been involved in countless schemes    1.67495327387791
to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such    1.5636360329510388
as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela. It was a sort of poetic    1.6432600607208703
justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow    1.7026049541338664
the Venezuelan government, reportedly involving the use of Dominican    1.5127085093302464
arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, has    1.5127085093302464
been uncovered and quashed.   The recent history of the Dominican    1.5636360329510388
Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly    1.7026049541338664
benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive. Unquestionably    1.3761581156320553
Trujillo did some good things for his country: he improved    1.5636360329510388
public facilities such as roads and sanitation, attracted industry and    1.5636360329510388
investment and raised the standard of living notably. But the price    1.6065767145351917
was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.    1.6065767145351917
El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth. The jails were    1.6065767145351917
filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his    1.5636360329510388
displeasure. He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States    1.5636360329510388
and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise, and his    1.5127085093302464
influence extended even to Congress.   Until the last year or so    1.6065767145351917
the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article    1.6432600607208703
of faith with Trujillo, and altogether too often this profession    1.5636360329510388
was accepted here as evidence of his good character. Tardily the Government    1.6432600607208703
here    1.0
came to understand how this country's own reputation was    1.5127085093302464
tarnished by the association with repression. Last year, after Trujillo    1.5636360329510388
had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean, the    1.5636360329510388
United States and many other members of the Organization of American    1.6065767145351917
States broke diplomatic relations with him.   Thereupon followed    1.4513752902486308
a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines. Trujillo's    1.5127085093302464
dictatorship had been along conservative, right-wing lines. But    1.4513752902486308
after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist    1.5636360329510388
slogans. There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with    1.5636360329510388
Castro in Cuba, previously a <bete noire> to Trujillo- thus    1.5636360329510388
illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.   1.6432600607208703
What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle. The    1.5127085093302464
Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little    1.5636360329510388
freedom for a generation, and all alternative leadership has been    1.5636360329510388
suppressed. Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability, but    1.6065767145351917
the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger. The Dominican    1.6065767145351917
Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily    1.4513752902486308
as toward Western freedom. Such a twist would be a tragedy for    1.6432600607208703
the Dominican people, who deserve to breathe without fear. For that    1.6065767145351917
reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative    1.5636360329510388
government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy    1.5636360329510388
and help.    1.0
High-speed buses on the George    1.1606783668269585
Washington Memorial Parkway, operating between downtown Washington    1.3761581156320553
and Cabin John, Glen Echo and Brookmont, would constitute    1.5127085093302464
an    1.0
alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency    1.5636360329510388
can do for this city. In presenting plans for such express buses    1.6432600607208703
before the Montgomery County Council, the administrator of the ~NCTA,    1.5636360329510388
C& Darwin Stolzenbach, was frankly seeking support for    1.4513752902486308
the projects his agency will soon be launching. Such support should    1.6065767145351917
not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ~NCTA    1.748515906000203
are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into    1.6065767145351917
the downtown area.   Because the buses would not stop on the    1.6065767145351917
parkway, land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed.    1.67495327387791
The ~NCTA is well advised to seek funds for this purpose    1.6065767145351917
from the present session of Congress.    1.2818970554302986
The inference has been too    1.1606783668269585
widely    1.0
accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades    1.5636360329510388
across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of    1.5636360329510388
that living city.   So far as the record is concerned, the Western    1.6432600607208703
powers have not acquiesced and should not do so.   Though Walter    1.6065767145351917
Ulbricht, by grace of Soviet tanks, may be head man in East    1.6432600607208703
Germany, that does not give him any right to usurp the government of    1.67495327387791
East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone.   1.6065767145351917
The wartime protocol of September 12, 1944, designated a special "Greater    1.6065767145351917
Berlin" area, comprising the entire city, to be under joint    1.5636360329510388
occupation. It was not a part of any one of the three (later four)    1.7026049541338664
zones for occupation by Soviet, American, British, and French troops    1.5636360329510388
respectively. After the Berlin blockade and airlift, the Council    1.5127085093302464
of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose "to mitigate the    1.6065767145351917
effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin".   1.6065767145351917
For some time the Communists honored the distinction    1.4513752902486308
between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin    1.6432600607208703
by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas. Then they moved    1.6432600607208703
offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin    1.5636360329510388
and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany.   1.6432600607208703
That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border    1.6065767145351917
have not    1.0
been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which    1.5636360329510388
Britain,    1.0
France, and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's    1.6065767145351917
gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other    1.5636360329510388
West German officials to West Berlin. The Chancellor had as    1.5636360329510388
much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin- and was certainly    1.6432600607208703
less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard    1.5127085093302464
Eisler.   The British and other replies to that Moscow note    1.5636360329510388
pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities "to integrate East    1.5636360329510388
Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting    1.6432600607208703
to make it the capital of East Germany". They insisted on    1.6065767145351917
the "fundamental fact" that "the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite    1.6065767145351917
status".   This is far from acknowledging or recognizing    1.4513752902486308
those efforts as an accomplished fact. There remains, of course, the    1.6065767145351917
question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent    1.6432600607208703
the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts.   One ground    1.5127085093302464
of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over    1.6065767145351917
into West Berlin as Communist "vopos" try to gun down fleeing    1.6065767145351917
unarmed residents. Another remained when an American Army car was    1.5636360329510388
recovered but with a broken glass. The glass may seem trivial but Communist    1.67495327387791
official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed.   1.5636360329510388
Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the    1.4513752902486308
West German misgivings about "salami" tactics, it is to be hoped    1.6065767145351917
that    1.0
the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's    1.6065767145351917
representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future    1.6065767145351917
indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed.    1.5636360329510388
Thousands of buffalo ("bison" they will    1.2818970554302986
never be to the man on the street) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug    1.7026049541338664
upon the rolling, dusty-green grassland. A horizon even and seamless,    1.5636360329510388
binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth.   That    1.5636360329510388
picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of    1.67495327387791
those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any    1.6432600607208703
later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood.    1.6432600607208703
For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the    1.6432600607208703
endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans    1.6432600607208703
the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the    1.67495327387791
Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill.   The National    1.5127085093302464
Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County,    1.6065767145351917
northeast Kansas, as a "Prairie National Park". There the    1.5127085093302464
buffalo would roam, to be seen as a tapestry, not as moth-eaten zoo    1.67495327387791
specimens. Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved.    1.6432600607208703
Grasslands would extend, unfenced, unplowed, unbroken by silo or barn-    1.5636360329510388
as the first settlers saw them.   The Park Service makes    1.5636360329510388
an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new    1.5636360329510388
park.    1.0

A Philadelphia distiller is currently    1.1606783668269585
breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising    1.3761581156320553
on ~TV and radio. Starting with small stations not members of    1.6065767145351917
the National Association of Broadcasters, the firm apparently is seeking    1.5636360329510388
to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations.   1.5127085093302464
Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional    1.6432600607208703
action requiring the Federal Communications Commission    1.2818970554302986
to ban such advertising through its licensing power.   The National    1.5636360329510388
Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor    1.3761581156320553
commercials. Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this    1.6065767145351917
policy. Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific    1.6065767145351917
prohibition.   Why, then, with these voluntary barricades and    1.4513752902486308
some state laws barring liquor ads, is it necessary to seek congressional    1.6432600607208703
action? Simply because the subverting action of firms that are    1.5636360329510388
not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and ~TV    1.6432600607208703
stations that are not members of the ~NAB tends to spread.   1.6065767145351917
Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want    1.6065767145351917
to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly    1.6432600607208703
from the efforts of non-code competitors.   Although the    1.4513752902486308
false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly    1.5636360329510388
no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which ~TV    1.5127085093302464
soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied, there is a sad difference    1.6065767145351917
between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him    1.5636360329510388
into downing bourbon.   A law is needed.    1.3761581156320553
Registered Democrats in New York City this year have    1.5127085093302464
the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and    1.5636360329510388
other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.   1.6432600607208703
In the central contest, that for Mayor, they may have found    1.6065767145351917
some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other.   1.6432600607208703
Mayor Robert F& Wagner must, as his opponents demand, assume    1.5636360329510388
responsibility for his performance in office. While all citizens    1.5127085093302464
share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious    1.67495327387791
problems in the schools, law enforcement and fiscal policies. The    1.5636360329510388
Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.   1.6065767145351917
State Controller Arthur Levitt, on the other hand, cannot effectively    1.5636360329510388
deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders    1.67495327387791
who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than    1.6432600607208703
in the city's welfare. They, too, have links with the city's    1.6065767145351917
ills.   Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited. Mayor    1.6065767145351917
Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed    1.4513752902486308
than those of Mr& Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence    1.6432600607208703
in his more protected state post.   As Mayor, Mr& Levitt    1.5636360329510388
might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters    1.67495327387791
would like. His election, on the other hand, would unquestionably    1.5636360329510388
strengthen the "regulars".   Mr& Wagner might or might    1.4513752902486308
not be a "new" Mayor in this third term, now that he is free of    1.7269387314284994
the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls "bosses". These    1.6065767145351917
are, of course, the same people whose support he has only now rejected    1.67495327387791
to seek the independent vote.   But his reelection would strengthen    1.5636360329510388
the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him.   1.5636360329510388
If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish,    1.6432600607208703
it nevertheless must be made. The vote still gives citizens a voice    1.6432600607208703
in the operation of their government and their party.    1.5127085093302464
Both Mr& ~K's have so far continued    1.3761581156320553
to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos.   President    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy, already two quiet demands down, still refused Thursday to    1.5636360329510388
be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow. But at the same    1.67495327387791
time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the    1.6432600607208703
fighting. And Secretary Rusk, en route to Bangkok, doubtless is    1.5636360329510388
trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian    1.6065767145351917
or Thai ~SEATO forces.   For Mr& Kennedy, speaking    1.4513752902486308
softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad    1.67495327387791
situation. The new President is in no position to start out his dealings    1.67495327387791
with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs. He must show at the outset    1.6432600607208703
that he means exactly what he says.   In this case he has put    1.67495327387791
the alternatives clearly to Mr& Khrushchev for the third time. At    1.6065767145351917
his press conference Mr& Kennedy said, "All we want in Laos    1.6065767145351917
is peace not war **h a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn".    1.7026049541338664
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in    1.67495327387791
unprovocative but ready position.   Since Laos is of no more purely    1.6065767145351917
military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington, this    1.6065767145351917
approach might be expected to head off Mr& Khrushchev for the moment.    1.6432600607208703
But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in    1.6065767145351917
Laos, the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride- a course    1.67495327387791
that would appear to cost him little on the spot, but would bog Washington    1.7026049541338664
in a tactical mess.   As wars go, Laos is an extremely    1.6065767145351917
little one. Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day. The    1.67495327387791
hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000    1.6065767145351917
tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters. But for the United States and    1.6065767145351917
its ~SEATO allies to attempt to shore up a less tough, less combat-tested    1.67495327387791
government army in monsoon-shrouded, road-shy, guerrilla-th'-wisp    1.2818970554302986
terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.    1.5127085093302464
But if anything can bring home to Mr& Khrushchev the idea that he    1.67495327387791
will not really get much enjoyment from watching this    1.5127085093302464
Braddock-against-the-Indians    1.0
contest, it will probably be the fact that ~SEATO    1.5127085093302464
forces are ready to attempt it- plus the fact that Moscow has something    1.67495327387791
to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations    1.5636360329510388
with Washington.   Fortunately both the Republicans and America's    1.4513752902486308
chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos    1.5636360329510388
aim of the President. Actually it would be more accurate to say that    1.67495327387791
the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British    1.6432600607208703
policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining    1.6432600607208703
table.   It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle    1.5636360329510388
so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.    1.6432600607208703
The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after    1.5636360329510388
the Geneva conference of 1954, and last year Washington backed the    1.6065767145351917
rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma.   But    1.5127085093302464
since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist    1.6432600607208703
position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire    1.67495327387791
patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of    1.5636360329510388
interested powers.   The road to a guaranteed-neutral, coup-proof    1.4513752902486308
Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain.    1.6432600607208703
But for the safety of Southeast Asia, and for the sake of the    1.67495327387791
Laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority    1.6065767145351917
now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that    1.6432600607208703
country from the cold war had to be made. The world awaits Mr& Khrushchev's    1.7026049541338664
choice of alternatives.    1.0
The Senate's overwhelming (64-13) vote to support locally controlled    1.5127085093302464
educational ~TV efforts should be emulated in the lower    1.5127085093302464
house.   Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing    1.5127085093302464
~ETV and the House has let them die. But this year prospects    1.6432600607208703
may be better. The House communications subcommittee is expected to    1.5636360329510388
report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.   1.67495327387791
This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the    1.5636360329510388
District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private,    1.6432600607208703
state, or municipal ~ETV efforts. The funds would be used    1.5636360329510388
for equipment, not for land, buildings, or operation.   The relatively    1.5636360329510388
few communities that have educational stations have found them    1.5127085093302464
of considerable value. But, lacking money from commercial sponsors, the    1.5636360329510388
stations have had    1.0
difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service.    1.3761581156320553
Other communities- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill-    1.6432600607208703
have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial    1.6065767145351917
cost of equipment.    1.0
Sam Rayburn was a good man,    1.2818970554302986
a good American, and, third, a good Democrat.   He was all    1.6065767145351917
of these rolled into one sturdy figure; Mr& Speaker, Mr& Sam,    1.6065767145351917
and Mr& Democrat, at one and the same time.   The House was    1.6432600607208703
his habitat and there he flourished, first as a young representative,    1.6065767145351917
then as a forceful committee chairman, and finally in the post for which    1.67495327387791
he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House, and second    1.6065767145351917
most powerful man in Washington.   Mr& Rayburn was not an easy    1.6065767145351917
man to classify or to label. He was no flaming liberal, yet the New    1.7026049541338664
Deal, the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him. He was    1.6432600607208703
not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that persuasion will    1.5636360329510388
miss him as much as any.   Two of the vital qualities demanded    1.6432600607208703
of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence    1.67495327387791
and that he keep his word. Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with    1.6432600607208703
him to the grave, for he was never loquacious, and his word, once    1.67495327387791
given, was not subject to retraction. It might be added that as he kept    1.7026049541338664
his word so he expected that others keep theirs.   The demonstration    1.6065767145351917
of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical. His leadership    1.5636360329510388
was not for audiences. A growl, a nod, was usually enough. When it    1.67495327387791
was not, one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.    1.6432600607208703
He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon his chest, his    1.7269387314284994
hands gripping the side of a desk, and the political and legislative    1.6432600607208703
chatter would subside into silence.   He spoke briefly, sensibly,    1.5127085093302464
to the point and without oratorical flourishes He made good, plain    1.6065767145351917
American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted    1.6065767145351917
upon it.   These public efforts were rare because Mr& Rayburn    1.5636360329510388
normally did his counseling, persuading and educating long before    1.5127085093302464
an issue reached its test on the House floor. He expected Democrats    1.6432600607208703
to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them. With    1.7026049541338664
his long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing in a political    1.7026049541338664
leader.   {He was, of course, in the House for a very long    1.6432600607208703
time. There are only two men remaining in Congress who, with Rayburn,    1.6432600607208703
voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917. To    1.6065767145351917
almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the    1.6432600607208703
existence of Mr& Sam coincided with that of the House}.    1.5636360329510388
And it was the House he loved. To be presiding officer of it was the    1.7269387314284994
end of his desire and ambition. The Senate to him was not the "upper    1.7026049541338664
body" and he corrected those who said he served "under" the    1.6065767145351917
president. He served "with" him.   Sound the roll of those    1.5636360329510388
with whom he served and who preceded him in death. Woodrow Wilson,    1.6432600607208703
with whom he began his years in Washington, Warren G& Harding,    1.6065767145351917
Calvin Coolidge, ~FDR, with whom he managed a social revolution.    1.5636360329510388
And those still with us, Herbert C& Hoover, Harry S& Truman,    1.6065767145351917
Dwight D& Eisenhower and John F& Kennedy.   He was    1.5127085093302464
a fighter for those of his own party. Mr& Truman has only to recall    1.7026049541338664
the "hopeless" campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan    1.6065767145351917
he was and the first experience of Mr& Kennedy with Congress would    1.6432600607208703
have been sadder than it was had not Mr& Sam been there. As it    1.7026049541338664
was, his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.   1.7026049541338664
With Republican presidents, he fought fair. He was    1.4513752902486308
his own man, not an automatic obstructionist. He kept his attacks    1.6065767145351917
on Republicanism for partisan campaigns, but that is part of the game    1.6432600607208703
he    1.0
was born to play.   Under any name- Mr& Speaker, Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the    1.6065767145351917
cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent    1.6432600607208703
death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends.   1.5636360329510388
In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported from that    1.6432600607208703
jungle. Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers dismembered the    1.5127085093302464
bodies and tossed the remains into the river. The excuse was offered    1.6432600607208703
for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.    1.6065767145351917
In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central    1.6432600607208703
government might be condoned, had the victims been serving the cause    1.6065767145351917
of dissident Katanga.   Does this suggest that the Congo    1.5127085093302464
is fit for nationhood or that ~UN is making any progress whatever    1.6432600607208703
toward its goal of so making it? To the contrary, through the past    1.67495327387791
six    1.0
weeks violence has been piled upon violence. Mass rapes, troop mutinies,    1.6065767145351917
uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures,    1.4513752902486308
given no sanction by any political authority, have become almost    1.5636360329510388
daily occurrences. Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is    1.6065767145351917
not the work of Katanga. It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville    1.67495327387791
government, which is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable    1.4513752902486308
of governing, and commanding only such limited credit abroad as ~UN    1.6065767145351917
support gives it.   The main question raised by the incident is    1.6065767145351917
how much longer will ~UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo    1.7026049541338664
problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in    1.67495327387791
present terms? The probable answer is that it will do so just as long    1.7026049541338664
as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African    1.7026049541338664
nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting    1.7026049541338664
ruin on Central Africa.   Right now, they are pushing    1.5127085093302464
a resolution which would have ~UN use its forces to invade and subjugate    1.67495327387791
Katanga. That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several    1.4513752902486308
points of view. The ~UN army is too weak, too demoralized for    1.6432600607208703
the task. Further, it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it    1.67495327387791
is now garrisoned. Last, it makes no sense to deliver Katanga, the one    1.67495327387791
reasonably solid territory, into the existing chaos.   The Congo    1.5127085093302464
should have been mandated, because it was not ready for independence.    1.6065767145351917
The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed    1.5636360329510388
over wisdom. It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because    1.67495327387791
it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism. But if    1.6065767145351917
any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly, it    1.6432600607208703
is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and    1.7026049541338664
urge some new approach. Otherwise, ~UN will march blindly on to    1.6065767145351917
certain defeat.    1.0
A recent editorial discussing    1.0
a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific    1.4513752902486308
Co& and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized    1.5636360329510388
on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.    1.6065767145351917
The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that    1.6432600607208703
the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed    1.5636360329510388
40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction    1.7026049541338664
in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year. Our comment    1.67495327387791
was that this was "featherbedding" in its ultimate form and that    1.6065767145351917
sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such    1.6432600607208703
an agreement. The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad    1.6065767145351917
had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but    1.5127085093302464
that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.   1.67495327387791
Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad    1.5127085093302464
gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.    1.6432600607208703
Also, normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision    1.5636360329510388
more or less academic.   The situation with regard to the Southern    1.6065767145351917
Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable    1.5636360329510388
to other situations in other industries. The solution reached in    1.5636360329510388
the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally    1.6065767145351917
included in a series of union demands.    1.3761581156320553
Time was when the house of delegates    1.3761581156320553
of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense    1.5636360329510388
side. But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of    1.6065767145351917
the bar, and when the lads met in St& Louis, it was not to grumble    1.7269387314284994
about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations    1.6065767145351917
was scarcely less than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and    1.5636360329510388
there.   It was, the brief writers decided, "man's best hope    1.5636360329510388
for a peaceful and law abiding world". Peace, it's wonderful, and    1.6065767145351917
"world law", it's wonderful, too, and shouldn't we get an international    1.6065767145351917
covenant extending it into space, before the Russians put    1.5127085093302464
some claim jumper on the moon?   Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev    1.5636360329510388
was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build    1.7026049541338664
a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of ~TNT, to knock    1.7026049541338664
sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice    1.67495327387791
of surrendering West Berlin to communism.   A nuclear pacifier    1.5127085093302464
of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger    1.6065767145351917
than anything the United States has triggered experimentally- would    1.5127085093302464
certainly produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev might    1.6065767145351917
use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St&    1.67495327387791
Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.   1.67495327387791
While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed    1.6065767145351917
an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in    1.67495327387791
the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.   "Fools",    1.5127085093302464
he bayed, "what do you think you are doing"?   The    1.5636360329510388
only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't    1.7269387314284994
playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations, but    1.6065767145351917
perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this    1.67495327387791
feeble effort.   Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason    1.5636360329510388
was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American    1.6432600607208703
plane by a demented Algerian with a gun. The craft made the familiar    1.67495327387791
unwelcome flight to Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro    1.5636360329510388
rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian    1.5636360329510388
foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock    1.67495327387791
Shadow. The plane was sent back to the United States, for    1.6065767145351917
a change, but Castro kept the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable    1.67495327387791
recruit to the revolution.   Less respect for the legal    1.5127085093302464
conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara,    1.5636360329510388
who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting    1.5127085093302464
in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined    1.5127085093302464
from the United States embassy at Caracas, Venezuela. The contents    1.5636360329510388
were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen, who were on hand    1.5636360329510388
to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.   1.6065767145351917
Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing    1.6065767145351917
American diplomatic papers and planes, but the Kennedy administration    1.5127085093302464
can always file a demurrer to the effect that, but for its own    1.67495327387791
incompetence in protecting American interests, these things would    1.4513752902486308
not happen. The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion    1.6432600607208703
mounted by the administration last April, which, we trust, is not    1.6065767145351917
symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious    1.6432600607208703
Khrushchev.   Pass the iron rations, please, and light another    1.5127085093302464
candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read    1.6432600607208703
a bit of world law just to pass the time away.    1.6065767145351917
The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission    1.5127085093302464
has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates    1.6432600607208703
on grain, as they had planned to do this month.   The request for    1.67495327387791
lower rates originated with the Southern railway, which has spent    1.5636360329510388
a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which    1.7026049541338664
it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional,    1.7269387314284994
smaller car. By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent, it and    1.67495327387791
its    1.0
associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have    1.6432600607208703
lost to truckers and barge lines.   The board's action shows    1.5636360329510388
what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.    1.67495327387791
WORD OF Dag Hammarskjold's death    1.1606783668269585
in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.    1.6432600607208703
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace, and    1.7026049541338664
his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously. It was    1.67495327387791
on the eve of a momentous U&N& session to come to grips with cold    1.7026049541338664
war issues. His firm hand will be desperately missed.   Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace. He had sought    1.6432600607208703
talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga    1.5636360329510388
province where recent fighting had been bloody. He earnestly    1.5127085093302464
urged a cease-fire.   The story of the fatal crash is not fully    1.6432600607208703
known. The U&N&-chartered plane which was flying from the conference    1.5636360329510388
city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun    1.6065767145351917
bullets last weekend and was newly repaired. Whether this, or    1.5636360329510388
overt action, was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.   1.6432600607208703
The death of Mr& Hammarskjold removes the United Nations'    1.5127085093302464
most controversial leader. He was controversial because he was uncompromising    1.5636360329510388
for peace and freedom with justice. He courageously defended    1.5127085093302464
the rights of small nations, and he stood his ground against the    1.6432600607208703
savage attacks of the Communist bloc.   The Congo, in whose cause    1.6065767145351917
he died, was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs. His policies    1.67495327387791
had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war    1.6065767145351917
and workable solutions were beginning to take shape. When the recent    1.6065767145351917
Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr& Hammarskjold, despite    1.4513752902486308
the danger, flew to exert a calming influence. He gave his life    1.6432600607208703
for his beliefs.   The U&N& session scheduled for today    1.5127085093302464
will meet under the cloud of his passing. It is a crucial session with    1.7026049541338664
the world on the edge of momentous developments.   If the manner    1.6065767145351917
of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication    1.7026049541338664
the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason    1.67495327387791
and justice. That is the hope of mankind.    1.4513752902486308
REACHING AGREEMENT on projects of value to the whole community    1.5636360329510388
has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks. Too    1.5636360329510388
many have bogged down in bickering. Even when public bodies arrived at    1.6432600607208703
a consensus, at least one dissenting vote has been usual.   So    1.6065767145351917
we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity. All nine members of    1.6432600607208703
the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody + Company's    1.4513752902486308
proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.   1.5127085093302464
The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms    1.67495327387791
of its contract. If the indenture is accepted, the authority will    1.6065767145351917
proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue. Then Goodbody    1.6065767145351917
will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious    1.6432600607208703
Graves Tract to house the center.   The next step awaits    1.5636360329510388
approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade    1.6432600607208703
County Port Authority. They allotted $500,000 three years ago to    1.5636360329510388
support Interama until its own financing could be arranged. Less than    1.6065767145351917
half the sum has been spent, since the Interama board pinched pennies    1.6432600607208703
during that period of painstaking negotiations. The balance is being    1.5636360329510388
budgeted for the coming year.   Unanimity on Interama is not    1.5636360329510388
surprising. It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly    1.67495327387791
everyone is agreed. The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim    1.6432600607208703
of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project.    1.7026049541338664
County officials have cooperated consistently. So have the people's    1.5127085093302464
elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.   Interama,    1.5127085093302464
as it rises, will be a living monument to Greater Miami's    1.6065767145351917
ability    1.0
to get together on worthwhile enterprises.    1.2818970554302986
PROGRESS, or lack of it, toward civil rights in    1.5127085093302464
the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued    1.6065767145351917
last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights.   1.5636360329510388
Much happened in this field during the past 12 months. Each state    1.6432600607208703
advisory committee documented its own activity. Some accounts are quite    1.5636360329510388
lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all, requiring only four    1.6065767145351917
paragraphs.   "The established pattern of relative calm in the    1.5127085093302464
field of race relations has continued in all areas", reported this    1.6065767145351917
group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South    1.6065767145351917
Floridians, William D& Singer and John B& Turner of Miami.   1.5636360329510388
"No complaints or charges have been filed during the past    1.5636360329510388
year, either verbally or written, from any individual or group.   1.5636360329510388
"The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed    1.5127085093302464
in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in    1.7026049541338664
its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from    1.6432600607208703
time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights".   Problems    1.6065767145351917
have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most    1.6432600607208703
cases with understanding and restraint. The progress reported by the    1.5636360329510388
advisory committee is real. While some think we move too fast and others    1.67495327387791
too slowly, Florida's record is a good one and stands out among    1.6432600607208703
the 50.    1.0
WEST GERMANY will    1.0
face the crucial tests that lie ahead, on Berlin and unification, with    1.6432600607208703
a coalition government. This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's    1.6065767145351917
national election.   Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic    1.2818970554302986
Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough    1.6432600607208703
to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957. In    1.6432600607208703
order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival    1.7269387314284994
parties which gained strength. Inevitably this means some compromise.   1.5127085093302464
The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired. Both    1.5636360329510388
Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22 seats in the    1.5636360329510388
new parliament, and the Free Democrats, who picked up 23, will insist    1.6432600607208703
on that before they enter the government.   Moon-faced Ludwig    1.5127085093302464
Erhart, the economic expert, probably will ascend to the leadership    1.5636360329510388
long denied him.   If he becomes chancellor, Dr& Erhart would    1.5636360329510388
make few changes. The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing    1.5636360329510388
industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise. He is dedicated    1.6065767145351917
to building the nation's strength and, as are all West Germans,    1.6065767145351917
to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany.   1.6065767145351917
What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the    1.67495327387791
voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.    1.6065767145351917
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per cent of the vote,    1.7026049541338664
approaches the party of Willy Brandt, which won 36 per cent, the result    1.67495327387791
would be a stiffening of the old resolve. West Berlin's Mayor    1.6065767145351917
Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his    1.6065767145351917
city and won votes by it.   The Free Democrats (12 per cent    1.6432600607208703
of the vote) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with    1.67495327387791
the Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist bloc.   1.5636360329510388
The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly    1.6432600607208703
toward more firmness or more flexibility. It could go either    1.5636360329510388
way, since the gains for both points of view were about the same.   1.67495327387791
Regardless of the decision two facts are clear. West Germany, with    1.6065767145351917
its industrial and military might, reaffirmed its democracy and remains    1.5636360329510388
firm with the free nations. And the career of Konrad Adenauer,    1.6065767145351917
who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which    1.4513752902486308
Bismarck    1.0
began, draws near the end.    1.1606783668269585
AMERICANS    1.0
are a nation of joiners, a quality which our friends find endearing    1.6432600607208703
and sometimes amusing. But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't    1.6432600607208703
want to make a spectacle of himself.   For instance, so-called    1.5636360329510388
"conservative" organizations, some of them secret, are sprouting    1.4513752902486308
in the garden of joining where "liberal" organizations once took    1.5636360329510388
root.   One specific example is a secret "fraternity" which    1.5127085093302464
will "coordinate anti-Communist efforts". The principle is commendable    1.4513752902486308
but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get    1.6432600607208703
gulled.   According to The Chicago Tribune News Service,    1.4513752902486308
State Atty& Gen& Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series    1.6065767145351917
of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization    1.6065767145351917
seeking his money and his name: _1._ Does it assail schools    1.6065767145351917
and churches with blanket accusations? _2._ Does it attack other    1.5636360329510388
traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?    1.4513752902486308
_3._ Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on    1.6065767145351917
everyone with whom it disagrees politically? _4._ Does it attempt    1.5636360329510388
to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars,    1.5636360329510388
communism, depression, and other troubles of the world? _5._ Does    1.5636360329510388
it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone    1.6065767145351917
calls and letter writing campaigns? _6._ Do its spokesmen    1.5127085093302464
seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the    1.67495327387791
principles they purport to advocate?   In some instances a seventh    1.5636360329510388
question can be added: _7._ Does the organization show an    1.5636360329510388
affinity for a foreign government, political party or personality in opposition    1.6065767145351917
or preference to the American system?   If the would-be    1.5127085093302464
joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists    1.67495327387791
who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic    1.6065767145351917
apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time. FALLING somewhere    1.5127085093302464
in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult    1.5636360329510388
to see but undeniably there, nevertheless- is the tropical green    1.5636360329510388
"city" of Islandia, a string of offshore islands that has almost    1.6065767145351917
no residents, limited access and an unlimited future. The latter is    1.6065767145351917
what concerns us all. Whatever land you can see here, from the North    1.67495327387791
tip end of Elliott Key looking southward, belongs to someone- people    1.6065767145351917
who have title to the land. And what you can't see, the land    1.67495327387791
underneath the water, belongs to someone, too. The public. The only    1.6065767145351917
real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water    1.67495327387791
land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater    1.6065767145351917
land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.    1.6432600607208703
In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the developers    1.6065767145351917
of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours.    1.7026049541338664
In this instance, happily, insistence is being made that our share    1.6065767145351917
is protected. And until this protection is at least as concrete as,    1.6432600607208703
say, the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach,    1.7269387314284994
those who represent us all should agree to nothing.    1.5127085093302464
The reaction of certain City Council members to    1.4513752902486308
California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.   1.6065767145351917
We had assumed that at least this local legislative    1.5127085093302464
body had nothing to hide, and, therefore, had no objections to making    1.6432600607208703
the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available    1.5636360329510388
to the public.   In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes,    1.5636360329510388
collectively known as the Brown Act, the Legislature declares that    1.5636360329510388
"the public commissions, boards and councils and other public agencies    1.5636360329510388
in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.    1.67495327387791
It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and    1.7026049541338664
that their deliberations be conducted openly.   "The people    1.4513752902486308
of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve    1.67495327387791
them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public    1.6065767145351917
servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and    1.7026049541338664
what is not good for them to know.   The full implementation of    1.6432600607208703
these noble words, however, has taken the efforts of five sessions of    1.6432600607208703
the Legislature. Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting    1.6065767145351917
guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted, but not    1.5636360329510388
until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining    1.6065767145351917
loopholes in the Brown Act.   Despite the lip service paid by    1.6065767145351917
local governments, the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted    1.5127085093302464
by reservations and rationalizations. When all else fails, it    1.5127085093302464
is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations.   1.5127085093302464
We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law- and one    1.7026049541338664
of its principal aims. Without public scrutiny the deliberations    1.5127085093302464
of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily. But the    1.6432600607208703
citizens would, of course, never be sure that the decisions that resulted    1.6432600607208703
were as correct as they were expeditious.    1.3761581156320553
@ IF THE Dominican Republic achieves    1.1606783668269585
free, democratic government, it will be due in large part to the U&S&    1.67495327387791
show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened    1.6065767145351917
restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.   Outwardly, Ciudad    1.2818970554302986
Trujillo is calm. None of the Trujillo family remains. Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Balaguer is in control, and opposition leaders have no further excuse    1.6065767145351917
to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections    1.6432600607208703
in the spring.   Had U&S& warships not appeared off    1.5127085093302464
the Dominican coast, there is every possibility that the country would    1.6065767145351917
now be wracked by civil war. Ultimately either the Trujillos would    1.6065767145351917
have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions    1.6432600607208703
favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro    1.5636360329510388
in Cuba.   Within the Organization of American States,    1.4513752902486308
there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention    1.5636360329510388
which was not without risk obviously. But there was no complaint from    1.6432600607208703
the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront    1.4513752902486308
shouting, "Vive Yankees"! More, the U&S& action was hailed    1.5127085093302464
by a principal opposition leader, Dr& Juan Bosch, as having saved    1.6065767145351917
"many lives and many troubles in the near future".   Mr&    1.5636360329510388

THOSE watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial    1.5636360329510388
unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor    1.6432600607208703
split in 1935.   Now, as then, it is a matter of jobs. Craft    1.67495327387791
unions seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory maintenance.   1.6065767145351917
The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession    1.5636360329510388
from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union    1.5636360329510388
members. That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American    1.67495327387791
Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.    1.5127085093302464
Or that's what it looked like at the time.   But automation    1.6065767145351917
and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition    1.5636360329510388
for jobs. Walter Reuther, leader of the industrial union faction    1.5636360329510388
of the ~AFL-~CIO, says another two years of this squabbling    1.5636360329510388
will be disastrous for all American labor.   Whether it could    1.5636360329510388
be as disastrous for American labor as, say, Jimmy Hoffa of the    1.6432600607208703
Teamsters, is a matter of conjecture. But the jurisdictional disputes    1.5636360329510388
that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for    1.6065767145351917
labor.   Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition    1.7026049541338664
of national survival, this country can have little patience with    1.5636360329510388
labor's family feuds. The concept of labor as a special class is    1.6432600607208703
outmoded, and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free    1.6432600607208703
world, labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself    1.7026049541338664
to survive. @    1.0
@ THE Army, Navy and Air    1.1606783668269585
Force, among others, may question Secretary Freeman's claim that    1.5127085093302464
the high estate of United States agriculture is the "strongest    1.5636360329510388
deterrent" to the spread of communism. But the secretary insists that    1.6065767145351917
the success of the American farmer is the "greatest single source    1.6065767145351917
of strength" in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.   1.6065767145351917
Mr& Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on    1.6432600607208703
a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity    1.6432600607208703
to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or    1.5636360329510388
even by the Soviet's successes in space. This shouldn't surprise    1.5636360329510388
the secretary; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses    1.5636360329510388
for a long, long time.   In fact, over the years, the American    1.6432600607208703
farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large    1.5636360329510388
dollar. And thus far, Mr& Freeman has offered very little relief.   1.6065767145351917
The 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary sponsored,    1.5127085093302464
has been declared a billion dollar fiasco. In exchange for higher price    1.6432600607208703
supports, growers pledged reduction in planted acreage. But the    1.5127085093302464
farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the    1.5127085093302464
rows and pouring on the fertilizer.   The result: $1.1 billion    1.5636360329510388
added to the deficit in the federal budget. Perhaps, as Mr& Freeman    1.6432600607208703
says, American agriculture may stop the Communists, but it is also    1.6065767145351917
swindling the American taxpayer. @    1.0
@ A SENATE subcommittee headed by Sen& Jackson of Washington    1.5127085093302464
has been going over the State Department and has reached some    1.6065767145351917
predictable conclusions. The department needs a clearer "sense of    1.5127085093302464
direction" at the top and it needs fewer, but better, people, Sen&    1.6432600607208703
Jackson says.   The subcommittee is not alone in questioning    1.5127085093302464
the effectiveness of the department. President Kennedy has indicated    1.5127085093302464
his dissatisfaction with its performance.   But those who would    1.5127085093302464
revitalize so complex an organization must, first of all, overcome the    1.6065767145351917
resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures,    1.5127085093302464
suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.   Nor does Sen&    1.5636360329510388
Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in    1.5636360329510388
the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the    1.6432600607208703
study of foreign policy. This tends to create friction and confusion    1.6065767145351917
and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and    1.67495327387791
initiative among his subordinates.   But competent observers believe    1.4513752902486308
he is making progress, particularly toward what Sen& Jackson    1.5127085093302464
lists as the primary need- "a clearer understanding of where our    1.6065767145351917
vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them".   1.6432600607208703
The Jackson report will provide some of the political support    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel    1.67495327387791
engaged, as Sen& Jackson puts it, "in work that does not really    1.6432600607208703
need doing". Mr& Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen& Jackson's    1.6065767145351917
recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national    1.4513752902486308
security problems be improved. Self-criticism is a rare but needed    1.5636360329510388

@ FORECASTING    1.0
economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist.    1.5636360329510388
But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he    1.6432600607208703
be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment    1.6065767145351917
trends.   James P& Mitchell, when he was the head of the department,    1.6432600607208703
promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below    1.5636360329510388
three million a couple of years ago. He lost, but settled for a cake    1.7026049541338664
in the shape of a fedora.   His successor, Secretary Goldberg,    1.5636360329510388
also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which    1.67495327387791
has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months. No    1.7026049541338664
betting man, Mr& Goldberg says he's merely "putting my neck out    1.6065767145351917
again" by predicting the rate will go down this month. He is basing    1.67495327387791
his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened    1.6065767145351917
its stride- a new record high in personal income, an increase    1.6065767145351917
in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for    1.7026049541338664
durable goods.   Mr& Mitchell had an excuse for losing- the    1.5636360329510388
steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. Mr& Goldberg    1.5636360329510388
has less reason for missing. The economy seems to be sailing along on    1.67495327387791
an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an    1.7026049541338664
end so they can't be blamed in November. The odds thus appear favorable    1.67495327387791

neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand, insists he would be very    1.6065767145351917
unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia.   1.5127085093302464

@ COMMERCE Secretary Hodges seems to have    1.2818970554302986
been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic    1.6065767145351917
forecasters. Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second    1.6065767145351917
quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking    1.6432600607208703
their heads in disagreement. Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and    1.5127085093302464
Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr& Hodges' appraisal,    1.5636360329510388
though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White    1.6432600607208703
House.   And now Mr& Hodges has pioneered further into the    1.5636360329510388
economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped    1.6065767145351917
sliding and that it should start going upward from this point. He    1.6432600607208703
is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.   1.67495327387791
The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail    1.5636360329510388
sales. February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the    1.6065767145351917
first pickup since last October, although it's still 1.5 per cent    1.6065767145351917
off from February 1960.   Corroborating Mr& Hodges' figures    1.4513752902486308
was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase    1.6065767145351917
in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4.    1.6065767145351917
In Newark, for example, this gain was put at 26 per cent above the    1.7026049541338664
year-earlier level. Of course, some of the credit for the sale boost    1.6432600607208703
must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter    1.7026049541338664
comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.   Another optimistic    1.6065767145351917
sign, this one from the Labor Department, was the report that    1.6065767145351917
the long rise in unemployment compensation payments "was interrupted    1.5127085093302464
for the first time in the week ending Feb& 25". Initial claims    1.6432600607208703
for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week    1.67495327387791
ending March 4.   Mr& Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook    1.6065767145351917
that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes.    1.7269387314284994
Well, we can't have everything. Prosperity for the whole nation    1.5636360329510388
is certainly preferred to a tax cut. @    1.3761581156320553
@ NEW JERSEY folk need not be told of the builder's march to    1.6432600607208703
the sea, for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles    1.67495327387791
of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that    1.67495327387791
remain. Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic attraction    1.6432600607208703
for exotic herons, is threatened, but the battlefront extends    1.5127085093302464
far beyond our state.   Against the dramatic fight being waged    1.5636360329510388
for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline, the tiny tract    1.6432600607208703
at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant. But Interior Secretary Udall    1.5636360329510388
warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few    1.7026049541338664
surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment    1.6432600607208703
of all as public preserves.   The move for establishment    1.5127085093302464
of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod, from Provincetown    1.67495327387791
to Chatham, is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest    1.4513752902486308
in that area. But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape    1.6432600607208703
is of more than regional concern, for the automobile age has made it the    1.7026049541338664
recreation spot of people from all over the country.   By comparison,    1.6065767145351917
Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable,    1.4513752902486308
for aside from the Audubon Society, they are mostly the snowy,    1.6065767145351917
common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana, green, little blue and    1.6065767145351917
black-crowned herons who nest and feed there. But there is hope, for    1.6432600607208703
Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the    1.5127085093302464
kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its    1.7026049541338664
park space.   The desirability of preserving such places as the    1.5636360329510388
Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every    1.5636360329510388
year. Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is    1.5636360329510388

regional demand for St& Louis goods and services reflects the region's    1.6065767145351917
relative lack of purchasing power. Not all St& Louis industries,    1.5636360329510388
of course, have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood.    1.6065767145351917
But for those which do, the slow growth of the area has a retarding    1.7026049541338664
effect on the metropolitan core. The city has a stake in stimulating    1.6432600607208703

effort to attract new industry. That is one approach. Another    1.5636360329510388
would be to take the advice of Dr& Elmer Ellis, president of    1.6432600607208703
the University of Missouri, and provide for an impartial professional    1.5636360329510388
analysis of Missouri's economy. He says the state, in order to    1.6065767145351917
proceed with economic development, must develop an understanding of how    1.5636360329510388
the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the    1.6432600607208703
national economy. @   The research center of the University's    1.4513752902486308

In Southern Illinois, the new federal program of help to economically    1.6065767145351917

Politics-ridden St& Clair county in Illinois presents    1.3761581156320553
another piece of the problem of metropolitan development. More industrial    1.5636360329510388
acreage lies vacant in St& Clair county than in any other    1.6065767145351917

there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side.   1.6432600607208703
And then there is St& Louis county, where the Democratic    1.5636360329510388

of the important relationship between proper land use and economic    1.5636360329510388
growth. St& Louis county under its present leadership also has    1.5636360329510388
largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform, and permitted    1.6432600607208703
parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests. Some    1.5127085093302464
plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St& Louis    1.5127085093302464
county doesn't want industry, and so they avoid the area, and more    1.6432600607208703
jobs are lost.   Metropolitan St& Louis's relatively slow    1.4513752902486308
rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political, business,    1.67495327387791
civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi. Without    1.6065767145351917
a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy, there will    1.5636360329510388
not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters, and St&    1.6432600607208703
Louis will slip into second-class status.    1.2818970554302986
Many of our very best friends are reformers. Still we must confess    1.6432600607208703
that sometimes some of them go too far. Take, for example, the reformers    1.67495327387791
among New York City's Democrats. Having whipped Mr& De    1.5127085093302464
Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall,    1.6432600607208703
they have changed the name to Chatham Hall. Even though headquarters    1.6065767145351917
actually have been moved into the Chatham building, do they believe    1.6065767145351917
that they can make the new name stick?   Granted that the Tammany    1.6432600607208703
name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political    1.6432600607208703
shame, the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to    1.67495327387791
their credit. But it is tradition rather than the record which balks    1.6432600607208703
at the expunging of the Tammany name. After all, it goes back to the    1.7026049541338664
days in which sedition was not un-American, the days in which the Sons    1.67495327387791
of St& Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force    1.5636360329510388
and violence- the British government that is.   Further, do    1.5127085093302464
our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent    1.5636360329510388
to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo? They will- when they    1.67495327387791
give up the donkey and the elephant. Instead of attempting the impossible,    1.6432600607208703
why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's    1.6065767145351917
stripes are not black? That might go over.    1.4513752902486308
The    1.0
White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official,    1.6432600607208703
Col& Mariano Faget,    1.0
from his preposterous position as interrogator    1.2818970554302986
of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service.   The    1.4513752902486308
Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds. The Kennedy    1.5127085093302464
Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have    1.5127085093302464
nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista. Using a Batista    1.6065767145351917
man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic    1.6065767145351917
forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro.   Moreover,    1.4513752902486308
Col& Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be    1.5636360329510388
useful in "screening" Castro agents; the Colonel fled to the    1.5636360329510388
friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized    1.6065767145351917
power. And while he had headed Batista's anti-Communist    1.4513752902486308
section,    1.0
the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open    1.67495327387791
opponents who were alleged to be Communists.   Responsibility    1.4513752902486308
for the Faget appointment rests with Gen& J& M& swing, an    1.6065767145351917
Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service. Gen& Swing    1.5636360329510388
has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the    1.6432600607208703
prerogatives of his office. His official term expired last summer.    1.5636360329510388
Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend,    1.6432600607208703
Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania, at a moment when the Kennedy    1.5636360329510388
Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it    1.5636360329510388
could get.   Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration    1.5127085093302464
matters, but he has announced plans to retire in 1962. At that    1.6432600607208703
point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen&    1.6065767145351917
Swing. The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration    1.6432600607208703
should not have to repeat.    1.1606783668269585
As    1.0
President, Dwight D& Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from    1.5636360329510388
the strife of partisan politics. As a former President, however, Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during    1.5636360329510388
a New York Republican rally, and generally missed his target.   1.5636360329510388
Mr& Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost    1.5636360329510388
by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a    1.7026049541338664
"juvenile experiment" and to suggest sending a Corps member to the    1.6065767145351917
moon. This was juvenile ridicule. Nowhere did the speaker recognize    1.5636360329510388
the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad. His    1.6432600607208703
words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name    1.7026049541338664
to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal    1.5636360329510388
of international understanding.   The former President blithely    1.3761581156320553
ignored recent history in speaking of "dollarette" dollars under    1.5127085093302464
Kennedy Administration fiscal policies. It was the Eisenhower Administration    1.5127085093302464
which produced the largest peacetime deficit.   Finally,    1.3761581156320553
Mr& Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington.    1.4513752902486308
This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis, when President Eisenhower    1.5636360329510388
first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional    1.6065767145351917
weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the    1.6432600607208703
picture too. The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion    1.6432600607208703
has hardly been compounded.   Ex-Presidents, relieved of accountability    1.4513752902486308
for policy, sometimes seem to feel free of accountability    1.5127085093302464
for their words. Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff    1.5127085093302464
discourses have been in that vein. Nobody can deny the right of former    1.67495327387791
Chief Executives to take part in politics, but the American people    1.6065767145351917
expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership    1.5636360329510388
and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility. This is a matter    1.67495327387791
of respect for the Presidency. Mr& Eisenhower's New York speech    1.5636360329510388
does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship.    1.6065767145351917
The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of    1.5127085093302464
speed, luxury, and impeccable British service on the high seas. Reports    1.6065767145351917
that the venerable liner, which has been in service since 1936, was    1.6432600607208703
to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us. But the Cunard    1.7026049541338664
line, influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment, has    1.5636360329510388
decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least.   1.67495327387791
A new queen, with the prosaic title of ~Q3, had been planned    1.6432600607208703
for several years to replace the Queen Mary. The British government,    1.6065767145351917
concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding    1.5127085093302464
industry, had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling    1.67495327387791
$50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger    1.5636360329510388
liner.   Since 1957, more and more trans-Atlantic passengers    1.4513752902486308
have been crossing by air. Economy class fares and charter flights    1.6065767145351917
have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines. Competition    1.5636360329510388
from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers    1.6065767145351917
from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked    1.6432600607208703
drop of profits on the Atlantic run.   The Cunard line has    1.6065767145351917
under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than    1.6065767145351917
75,000 tons. This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for    1.67495327387791
cruises during the lean winter months. Also under consideration is    1.5636360329510388
an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to    1.6065767145351917
serve New York.   The decline of the Cunard line from its position    1.6432600607208703
of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development    1.5127085093302464
in the history of transportation.    1.1606783668269585
Gen& Maxwell    1.0
Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is "very much encouraged"    1.5636360329510388
about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam    1.5636360329510388
turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement    1.5636360329510388
that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to    1.5636360329510388
bolster the Vietnamese Army. Gen& Taylor will report to President    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet    1.7026049541338664
Nam and, judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East,    1.7026049541338664
he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese    1.6065767145351917
military, economic, political and other resources.   There was    1.4513752902486308
good reason for Gen& Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time.    1.67495327387791
Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their    1.4513752902486308
activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a    1.6432600607208703
new crisis. South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year- more than    1.6432600607208703
300,000 tons- may have been destroyed. The Viet Cong, the Communist    1.6065767145351917
rebels, may have lost their stored grain and arms factories.    1.5636360329510388
The    1.0
rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the    1.7026049541338664
floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.   Nothing that    1.5636360329510388
is likely to happen, however, should prompt the sending of United    1.6065767145351917
States soldiers for other than instructional missions. The Indochina    1.5127085093302464
struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954, when Gen& Ridgway    1.67495327387791
estimated    1.0
it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win    1.7269387314284994
a war the French were losing. It is a war to stay out of today, especially    1.748515906000203
in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently    1.6065767145351917
does not want United States troops. He may want additional technical    1.6065767145351917
help, and this should be forthcoming. South Viet Nam has received    1.6065767145351917
$1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance    1.6432600607208703
has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B& Johnson's    1.5636360329510388
visit last May.   Gen& Taylor, the President's    1.3761581156320553
special military adviser, is a level-headed officer who is not likely    1.6065767145351917
to succumb to propaganda or pressure. It is probable that his recommendations    1.6432600607208703
will be informed and workable, and that they will not lead to    1.6432600607208703
involving the United States in an Asian morass.   1.4513752902486308
Gov& John M& Dalton, himself a lawyer and a man of long    1.6432600607208703
service in government, spoke with rich background and experience when    1.5636360329510388
he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the    1.7026049541338664
Missouri General Assembly, or quit accepting fees from individuals    1.5127085093302464
and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the    1.6432600607208703
government and who are retained, not because of their legal talents,    1.6065767145351917
but because of their government influence.    1.2818970554302986
Ambassador Stevenson yesterday    1.0
described the U& N&'s problem of electing a temporary    1.5127085093302464
successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as "the gravest crisis the    1.6065767145351917
institution has faced". Of course it is. If the decision goes wrong,    1.6432600607208703
it may be- as Mr& Stevenson fears- "the first step on the    1.6432600607208703
slippery path downhill" to a U& N& without operational responsibilities    1.5636360329510388
and without effective meaning.   The integrity of the    1.4513752902486308
office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be, as    1.6065767145351917
the Charter puts it, "the chief administrative officer of the Organization",    1.6065767145351917
but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions    1.6432600607208703
from any government or any other authority "external to    1.5127085093302464
the Organization". In other words, the Secretary General is to be    1.6065767145351917
a nonpartisan, international servant, not a political, national one.    1.5127085093302464
He should be, as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was, a citizen of the    1.6432600607208703
world.   The Charter does stipulate that "due regard" shall    1.5127085093302464
be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on "as wide a geographical    1.7026049541338664
basis as possible". The United States and its allies have    1.5636360329510388
had no objection to this. What they have objected to is the attempt    1.67495327387791
of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's    1.6432600607208703
death to turn the entire U& N& staff from the Secretary down    1.6432600607208703
into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.   1.6065767145351917
The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic    1.5636360329510388
origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and, more particularly,    1.6065767145351917
around the nature of his relationship with them. Although    1.5127085093302464
the United States and the U& S& S& R& have been arguing    1.6432600607208703
whether there shall be four, five or six top assistants, the most important    1.67495327387791
element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the    1.6432600607208703
manner in which these deputies are to do their work.   If any one    1.67495327387791
of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions    1.6065767145351917
the nature of the organization will have changed. If they give him advice    1.67495327387791
when he asks it, or if they perform specified duties under his direction,    1.67495327387791
the nature of the U& N& will not of necessity change.    1.6065767145351917
The Secretary General must have, subject to the constitutional direction    1.5636360329510388
of the Security Council and the General Assembly, the power    1.5636360329510388
to act, to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled    1.6432600607208703
by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions.   1.5127085093302464
This is the root issue for which the United States should stand.    1.6432600607208703
We should not become confused or let our public become confused over    1.6432600607208703
irrelevant questions of number or even of geography. What we must    1.6065767145351917
have, if the United Nations is to survive, is as nonpolitical, nonpartisan    1.6432600607208703
an organization at the top as human beings can make it, subject    1.6432600607208703
to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's    1.6065767145351917
ambition.    1.0
The new City Charter,    1.0
which should get a Yes vote as Question No& 1 on Nov& 7, would    1.7026049541338664
not make a good Mayor out of a bad one. There is no such magic    1.7269387314284994
in man-made laws. But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive    1.6065767145351917
powers, remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of    1.67495327387791
inaction in the Board of Estimate, increase his budget-making authority    1.5636360329510388
both as to expense and capital budgets, and vest in him the right    1.67495327387791
to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.   1.6065767145351917
Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate    1.5127085093302464
and made    1.0
a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor. Thus    1.6065767145351917
there is a clearer division of authority, administrative and legislative.    1.5636360329510388
The board is diminished in both respects, while it retains control    1.6065767145351917
over zoning, franchises, pier leases, sale, leasing and assignment    1.5127085093302464
of property, and other trusteeship functions. The board will be able    1.6065767145351917
to increase, decrease, add or eliminate budget items, subject to the    1.6065767145351917
Mayor's veto; but the City Council will now share fully this    1.6065767145351917
budget-altering power. Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes    1.5127085093302464
will require concurrence by board and Council, and a two-thirds vote.   1.6065767145351917
The Controller retains his essential "fiscal watchdog" functions;    1.4513752902486308
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed.    1.5127085093302464
He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties, which go to the Finance    1.6065767145351917
Department. On net balance, in spite of Controller Gerosa's    1.5127085093302464
opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office, the Controller    1.67495327387791
will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government    1.5636360329510388
than he has now.   Borough Presidents, while retaining    1.4513752902486308
membership in the Board of Estimate, lose their housekeeping functions.    1.5636360329510388
Highways go to a new Department of Highways, sewers to the Department    1.6432600607208703
of Public Works, such street cleaning as Borough Presidents    1.5127085093302464
now do (in Queens and Richmond) to the Sanitation Department.   1.5636360329510388
Some fiscal changes are important. The expense (operating) budget    1.5127085093302464
is to be a program budget, and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy    1.7269387314284994
(with the Mayor approving) in fund transfers within a department.    1.5636360329510388
The capital budget, for construction of permanent improvements, becomes    1.5127085093302464
an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises;    1.6065767145351917
but, as a second-look safeguard, each new project must undergo    1.5636360329510388
a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.   1.5127085093302464
A road block to desirable local or borough improvements, heretofore    1.5636360329510388
dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on    1.6432600607208703
progress, is removed by making these a charge against the whole city    1.6432600607208703
instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected. This will    1.6065767145351917
have a beneficial effect by expediting public business; it will also    1.6065767145351917
correct some injustices.   Enlargement of the City Council    1.4513752902486308
and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.    1.6065767145351917
The Inter-american Press Association,    1.0
which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape    1.5636360329510388
Horn, is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in    1.7026049541338664
eleven years. The I& A& P& A& is a reflection of the problems    1.67495327387791
and hopes of the hemisphere; and in these days this inevitably    1.6065767145351917
means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution.    1.5636360329510388
As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime,    1.6432600607208703
more and more Cuban publishers, editors and correspondents were forced    1.5636360329510388
into exile. The I& A& P& A& found itself driven from journalism    1.6432600607208703
into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall    1.6432600607208703
of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the    1.67495327387791
freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952.    1.5127085093302464
Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption    1.67495327387791
and social imbalances. In such conditions all freedoms are lost.    1.5636360329510388
This, in more diplomatic language, is what Adlai Stevenson told the    1.6065767145351917
newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States    1.6432600607208703
Government. He felt able to end on a note of hope. He sees evidence    1.7026049541338664
of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with    1.6065767145351917
its emphasis on social reforms. No group can contribute more to the    1.6432600607208703
success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American    1.6432600607208703
Press Association.    1.0
The Twenty-second    1.0
Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a    1.5636360329510388
situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago    1.5636360329510388
when this meeting was first announced. According to the original program,    1.6065767145351917
Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin    1.5127085093302464
this morning to be filled with admiration or rage- depending    1.5636360329510388
upon individual or national politics- because of the "bold program    1.5636360329510388
for building communism in our time" which the Congress will adopt.    1.6065767145351917
But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have    1.6432600607208703
achieved Utopia by 1980, the world is watching Moscow today primarily    1.6065767145351917
for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in    1.67495327387791
the immediate future.   The evident contradiction between the rosy    1.5127085093302464
picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's    1.5127085093302464
program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier    1.6065767145351917
Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that    1.5636360329510388
the program may be severely altered. Whether it is or not, the propaganda    1.67495327387791
impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted    1.6432600607208703
at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated.    1.6432600607208703
And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on    1.67495327387791
and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised    1.7026049541338664
for 1980 they and their children must first survive.   This    1.5636360329510388
Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and    1.5127085093302464
laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness    1.6065767145351917
remove him from the scene in the next few years. The widespread purge    1.67495327387791
that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist    1.6432600607208703
leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who    1.6065767145351917
will dominate the Congress, and the Central Committee it will elect,    1.6065767145351917
will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening, both    1.5636360329510388
for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job.    1.6432600607208703
Dr& James B& Conant has    1.1606783668269585
earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer.    1.6065767145351917
His earlier reports considered the American public schools    1.4513752902486308
basically sound and not in need of drastic change. Now, a close look    1.67495327387791
at the schools in and around the ten largest cities, including New York,    1.67495327387791
has shattered this optimism. Dr& Conant has come away shocked    1.5636360329510388
and angry. His new book, entitled "Slums and Suburbs", calls for    1.6065767145351917
fast and drastic action to avert disaster.   There is room for    1.6065767145351917
disagreement concerning some of Dr& Conant's specific views. His    1.5127085093302464
strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside    1.6065767145351917
their own neighborhood, in the interest of integration, will be    1.5636360329510388
attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for, and achieved, this open    1.6432600607208703
or permissive enrollment. Dr& Conant may underestimate the psychological    1.5127085093302464
importance of even token equality.   His suggestion that    1.4513752902486308
the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical,    1.5636360329510388
law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges    1.6432600607208703
themselves- even though what he is recommending is already taking    1.5636360329510388
shape as a trend.   But these are side issues to a powerful    1.6432600607208703
central theme. That theme cuts through hypocrisies, complacency and    1.5127085093302464
double-talk. It labels the slums, especially the Negro slums, as dead-end    1.6065767145351917
streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters. The villains    1.5127085093302464
of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters,    1.6432600607208703
and Dr& Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike. The facts,    1.6065767145351917
he adds, are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling    1.6432600607208703
bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration    1.6432600607208703
rather than on real improvement of the schools, regardless of    1.5636360329510388
the color of their students.   A call for action "before it    1.6065767145351917
is too late" has alarming implications when it comes from a man who,    1.67495327387791
in his    1.0
previous reports on the schools, cautioned so strongly against extreme    1.5636360329510388
measures. These warnings must not be treated lightly. Dr& Conant's    1.5636360329510388
conscientious, selfless efforts deserve the nation's    1.2818970554302986
gratitude.    1.0
He has served in positions of greater glamour, both at home and abroad;    1.67495327387791
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward    1.6432600607208703
report on the state of the public schools.    1.4513752902486308
A fascinating letter has just reached    1.2818970554302986
this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail.    1.6432600607208703
He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now    1.6432600607208703
going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives    1.5636360329510388
in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps, names, addresses    1.6432600607208703
or even zone numbers. In accordance with legislation passed    1.5127085093302464
at the last session of Congress, each Representative is authorized to    1.6065767145351917
deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters, speeches and other    1.6065767145351917
literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district. This means    1.67495327387791
an added burden to innumerable postmen, who already are complaining    1.5636360329510388
of heavy loads and low pay, and it presumably means an increased postal    1.67495327387791
deficit, but, our correspondent writes, think of the additional junk    1.5636360329510388
mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.    1.67495327387791
@    1.67495327387791
Letter writing is a dying    1.1606783668269585
art. Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and    1.6065767145351917
many are written by companies to one another, but these are mostly    1.6432600607208703
typewritten. Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly    1.6065767145351917
be called a letter.   1.0
Old, tired, trembling the woman came to the cannery. She had,    1.6065767145351917
she said, heard that the plant was closing. It couldn't close, she    1.6432600607208703
said. She had raised a calf, grown it beef-fat. She had, with her own    1.7026049541338664
work-weary hands, put seeds in the ground, watched them sprout, bud,    1.6065767145351917
blossom, and get ready to bear. She was ready to kill the beef, dress    1.7026049541338664
it out, and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup, broth,    1.7026049541338664
hash, and stew against the winter. She had done it last year, and    1.67495327387791
the year before, and the year before that, and she, and her people    1.67495327387791
were dependent upon these cans for food.   This did not happen in    1.6432600607208703
counties of North Georgia, where the rivers run and make rich the    1.6432600607208703
bottom land. Nor in South Georgia, where the summer sun shines warmly    1.6432600607208703
and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.   1.6432600607208703
This happened in Decatur, DeKalb County, not 10 miles from the    1.6065767145351917
heart of metropolitian Atlanta.   And now, the woman, tired and    1.5636360329510388
trembling, came here to the DeKalb County cannery. "Is it so the    1.6432600607208703
cannery is going to close"?   O& N& Moss, 61, tall,    1.5636360329510388
grey as a possum, canning plant chief since 1946, didn't know what    1.6432600607208703
to say. He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this    1.7269387314284994
summer. He did say he was out of cans, the No& 3's, but "I requisitioned    1.7269387314284994
22,000". He said he had No& 2's enough to last two    1.6065767145351917
weeks more.   Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one. A    1.6432600607208703
three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles    1.4513752902486308
O& Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed. Reason:    1.5636360329510388
the cannery loses $3,000 yearly.   But DeKalb citizens, those    1.5127085093302464
who use the facilities of the cannery, say the cannery is not supposed    1.67495327387791
to make any money.   "The cannery", said Mrs& Lewellyn    1.5127085093302464
Lundeen, an active booster of the cannery since its opening during    1.6065767145351917
the war and rationing years of 1941, to handle the "victory garden"    1.6432600607208703
produce, "is a service to the taxpayer. And one of the best services    1.67495327387791
available to the people who try to raise and can meat, to plant,    1.67495327387791
grow vegetables and put them up. It helps those people who help themselves.   1.67495327387791
"The county, though, seems more interested in those    1.4513752902486308
people who don't even try, those who sit and draw welfare checks and    1.67495327387791
line up for surplus food".   A driver of a dairy truck, who    1.6432600607208703
begins work at 1 a&m& finishes before breakfast, then goes out and    1.6432600607208703
grows a garden, and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family    1.7269387314284994
of five, asked, "What in the world will we do"?   "What    1.6065767145351917
in the world", echoed others, those come with the beans, potatoes,    1.6065767145351917
the tomatoes, "will any of us do"?   Moss, a man who knows    1.6432600607208703
how much the cannery helps the county, doesn't believe it will close.    1.6432600607208703
But he is in the middle, an employe of DeKalb, but on the side    1.7026049541338664
of the people.   The young married people; the old couples. The    1.6065767145351917
dairy truck driver; the old woman with the stew.   "Don't    1.5636360329510388
ask me if I think the cannery helps", he said. "Sir, I know    1.67495327387791
the cannery helps".   1.0
Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard.    1.6432600607208703
When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or    1.6065767145351917
hardship it is not always easy to say, "Just forget it". There    1.6432600607208703
is one thing I know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner    1.7026049541338664
peace as long as the heart holds a grudge. I know a man who held    1.7269387314284994
resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades. Several years    1.6065767145351917
ago I was his pastor. One night, at the close of the evening service,    1.7026049541338664
he came forward, left his resentment at the altar and gave his    1.6432600607208703
heart to God. After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story    1.7026049541338664
of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on    1.7269387314284994
his land.   "We tried to settle this dispute", he said, "but    1.6065767145351917
could never come to an agreement. I settled it tonight", he continued.    1.6432600607208703
"I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has    1.6432600607208703
been lifted off my heart, I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven    1.7269387314284994
my neighbor".   Forgiveness is the door through which a    1.5127085093302464
person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God. You cannot wear the banner    1.7026049541338664
of God and at the same time harbor envy, jealousy and grudges in    1.67495327387791
your heart. Henry van Dyke said, "Forgive and forget if you can;    1.6432600607208703
but forgive anyway".   Jesus made three things clear about    1.5127085093302464
forgiveness. We must, first of all, be willing to forgive others before    1.6432600607208703
we can secure God's forgiveness. "For if ye forgive men their    1.6065767145351917
trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye    1.6065767145351917
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive    1.5636360329510388
your trespasses". Matthew 6:14-15. It will do no good to seek    1.6065767145351917
God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.   1.6432600607208703
Then, Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited.    1.4513752902486308
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these    1.6432600607208703
words, "Forgive us our debts". When a person meets God's requirements    1.6065767145351917
for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven. God's mercy    1.5636360329510388
and patience will last forever. Forgiveness implies more than a person    1.6065767145351917
wanting his past sins covered by God's love. It also implies    1.6065767145351917
that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past.    1.7269387314284994
We want the past forgiven, but at the same time we must be willing for    1.7269387314284994
God to direct the future.   Finally, we must be willing to forgive    1.6432600607208703
others as many times as they sin against us. Once Peter asked,    1.6432600607208703
"How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till    1.67495327387791
seven times? Jesus saith unto him, until seventy times seven".    1.5636360329510388
Matthew 18:21-22.   Jesus not only taught forgiveness, He    1.4513752902486308
gave us an example of it on the cross. With all the energy of his broken    1.748515906000203
body he prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what    1.6065767145351917
they do". Luke 23:34.   1.0
She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now, although    1.7026049541338664
she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby, she is getting    1.6432600607208703
married. Her mother, now dead, was my good friend and when she came to    1.7026049541338664
tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish    1.748515906000203
to say something meaningful to her, something her mother would wish    1.6065767145351917
said. For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't    1.6432600607208703
have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message    1.6432600607208703
to Garcia. But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been    1.7026049541338664
through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young    1.6432600607208703
female- six girls sprawled on one bed, drinking Cokes and giggling-    1.6065767145351917
she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.   "How    1.67495327387791
do you know you love somebody enough to get married"? she asked.   1.6432600607208703
It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have    1.5636360329510388
ever asked: How can you be sure?   "Aren't you sure"?    1.5636360329510388
I asked, looking at her searchingly. I wanted to grab her by the    1.67495327387791
arm and beg her to wait, to consider, to know for certain because life    1.7026049541338664
is so long and marriage is so important. But if she were just having    1.7026049541338664
a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten    1.6065767145351917
her out of a really good marriage. Besides, in all honesty, I don't    1.67495327387791
know how you can be sure. I don't know any secret recipe for certainty.    1.7026049541338664
In the fevered, intoxicating, breathless state of being in love    1.5636360329510388
the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships    1.6065767145351917
are sometimes obscured. I knew of but one test and I threw it    1.67495327387791
out to her for what it was worth.   "Does he ever bore you"?    1.67495327387791
I asked.   "Bore me"? she was shocked. Oh, no-o! Why,    1.5636360329510388
he's so darling and **h"   "I mean", I went on ruthlessly,    1.6065767145351917
"when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders    1.6065767145351917
of love, is he interesting? Does he care about things that matter    1.6432600607208703
to you? Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island    1.67495327387791
for years and years and still find him fascinating?   Because,    1.5636360329510388
honey, I thought silently, there are plenty of desert islands in    1.6065767145351917
every marriage- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded, together.    1.5127085093302464
And if you bore each other then, heaven help you.   She came    1.6432600607208703
back the other day to reassure me. She has studied and observed and    1.67495327387791
she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.   1.67495327387791
She asked if I had other advice and, heady with success,    1.6065767145351917
I rushed it in, I hope not too late. Be friends with your mother-in-law.    1.7026049541338664
Jokes, cartoons and cynics to the contrary, mothers-in-law make    1.5127085093302464
good friends.   1.0
I do not know Dr& Wilson Sneed well. But I was deeply moved    1.67495327387791
by his letter of resignation as rector of St& Luke's Church    1.6065767145351917
in Atlanta. It was the cry of not just one heart; it spoke for many    1.7269387314284994
in the clergy, I suspect. The pulpit is a lonely place. Who stops    1.67495327387791
to think of that?   Imagine the searching and the prayer that    1.6065767145351917
lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service    1.67495327387791
to this majestic church. "Such a church needs vigor and vitality    1.6065767145351917
in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments",    1.67495327387791
he told his members.   A minister should not stay "beyond the    1.6065767145351917
time that his leadership should benefit" his church, he wrote, "**h    1.6065767145351917
And so the young minister    1.1606783668269585
resigned, to go and study and pray, having never passed a day, he    1.67495327387791
told his parishioners, when "I did not gain from you far more than    1.67495327387791
I ever gave to you".   His very honest act called up the recent    1.67495327387791
talk I had with another minister, a modest Methodist, who said:    1.6065767145351917
"I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love    1.7269387314284994
and comfort to other men, and I would have it no other way: and    1.7026049541338664
it is unworthy to think of self. But oh, how I do sometimes need just    1.7269387314284994
a moment of rest, and peace, in myself".   A man who gives    1.6432600607208703
himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself    1.67495327387791
a life of giving. He does not expect to get great riches or he would    1.7269387314284994
not have chosen to answer the call to preach. The good ones are not    1.7026049541338664
motivated to seek vainly, nor are they disposed to covet comfort, or they    1.67495327387791
would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity.    1.6432600607208703
Yet we who    1.0
lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation    1.67495327387791
of the infinite through him- we who readily accept his sacrifice    1.6065767145351917
as our due, we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is    1.7269387314284994
in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul. We press    1.7026049541338664
him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions    1.67495327387791
with his word, and God's. We do not defeat the good ones    1.6432600607208703
with this cruelty, but we add to their burden, while expecting them    1.6432600607208703
to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance    1.6065767145351917
and a few bucks a week, American cash. If we break the minister    1.67495327387791
to our bit, we are buying back our own sins. If he won't break, we    1.7269387314284994
add to the stress he bears.   And a minister of all men is most    1.7026049541338664
conscious that he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly    1.6432600607208703
humanity is heir to. We expect him to be noble, and to make us so-    1.7269387314284994
yet he knows, and tries to tell us, how very humble man must be.   1.7026049541338664
We expect bestowal of God's love through him. But how little love    1.6432600607208703
we give him. The church truly is not a rest home for saints, but a    1.7269387314284994
hospital for sinners. Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency    1.6432600607208703
room to receive first aid, and we leave unmindful that the man who    1.67495327387791
ministered to us is a human being who suffers, too.   1.5636360329510388
Mr& Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each    1.5636360329510388
summer at Loon Lake. The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around    1.6432600607208703
it only emphasized the pleasure.   The evening was not always    1.5636360329510388
spent in the same way. This year, on a night cool with the front of September    1.748515906000203
moving in, but with plenty of summer still about, the Podgers    1.6065767145351917
were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod. The little cottage    1.6065767145351917
was bursting with people of all ages.   In the midst of it all,    1.67495327387791
Mr& Podger came out on the Pod porch, alone. He had that day    1.67495327387791
attended a country auction, and he had come back with a prize.    1.6432600607208703
The prize was an old-fashioned, woven cloth hammock, complete with cross-top    1.6065767145351917
pillow, fringed side pieces, and hooks for hanging. Mrs& Podger    1.5636360329510388
had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for    1.6432600607208703
it, and there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night breeze    1.67495327387791
rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.   Mr&    1.5127085093302464
Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and forth in one or two    1.7026049541338664
slow, rhythmic motions, and then swung his feet up into it. He closed    1.67495327387791
his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly    1.6065767145351917
over him. Suddenly one young voice rose above the others. "But",    1.6065767145351917
it said, "do you always <know> when you're happy"?    1.5127085093302464
The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound, but the question    1.67495327387791
stayed in Mr& Podger's mind. Here, in the cool, autumn-touched    1.5636360329510388
evening, Mr& Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly    1.6432600607208703
It had begun with the blue jay    1.3761581156320553
feather. Walking along the lake before breakfast, Mr& Podger had    1.5636360329510388
seen the feather, and the bird that had lost it in flight. The winging    1.7026049541338664
spread of blue had gone on, calling harshly, into the wood. The    1.6432600607208703
small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet. All    1.7269387314284994
day long Mr& Podger, who was a straw-hat man in the summer, had    1.67495327387791
worn    1.0
the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield. Would a blue    1.6432600607208703
feather in a man's hat make him happy all day? Hardly. But it    1.67495327387791
was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning    1.6432600607208703
sunshine, linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by    1.7026049541338664
the lake.   Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he had    1.6432600607208703
walked to it. And there, on the way, had been the box turtle, that    1.7026049541338664
slow, self-contained, world-ignoring relic of pre-history, bent, for    1.4513752902486308
reasons best known to itself, on crossing the road. It was doing very    1.67495327387791
well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing its way with commendable    1.67495327387791
singleness of purpose when Mr& Podger saw hazard approaching    1.5127085093302464
in the shape of a flashy little sports car. Would the driver see    1.67495327387791
the turtle? Would he take pains to avoid it?   Mr& Podger    1.6065767145351917
took no chances. Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with    1.6432600607208703
it, Mr& Podger stepped into the road, lifted the surprised turtle    1.6065767145351917
and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking    1.6065767145351917
suddenness.   The turtle immediately withdrew into its private    1.4513752902486308
council room to study the phenomenon. But Mr& Podger and the    1.6065767145351917
driver of the sports car waved at each other. Here in the cool darkness    1.7026049541338664
Mr& Podger could still feel the warmth of midday, could still    1.6065767145351917
see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road, could still see the    1.6432600607208703
friendly grin on the young, sun-browned face as the driver looked back    1.6432600607208703
over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight.   1.67495327387791
Where was the driver now? What was he doing? And the turtle?    1.6432600607208703
Mr& Podger smiled. For a few brief minutes they had all been    1.6432600607208703
part of one little drama. The three would never meet again, but for    1.67495327387791
some reason or other Mr& Podger was sure he would always remember    1.6432600607208703
the incident.   Then there had been the auction itself. Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Podger heard again, at will, the voice of the auctioneer, the voices    1.6432600607208703
of the bidders, and finally the small boy who had been so interested    1.67495327387791
in Mr& Podger's hammock purchase.   "I like them things,    1.5127085093302464
too", he had said. "We got one at home. You know what? If    1.67495327387791
you're lyin' out in the hammock at night, and it gets kinda cool-    1.67495327387791
you know- you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-    1.6432600607208703
and wrap 'em right over you. I do it, lots o' times- I like to    1.7269387314284994
lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when it's all quiet. **h The    1.7026049541338664
Mr& Podger    1.0
had    1.0
thanked him gravely, and now he made use of the advice. As he pulled    1.7026049541338664
the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon, Mr& Podger    1.6432600607208703
saw that thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped that    1.6065767145351917
the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped quiet.   Alacrity,    1.6065767145351917
the Podger cat, came by the hammock, rubbed her back briefly    1.6065767145351917
against it, and then, sure of a welcome, hopped up. She remarked that    1.67495327387791
she found the night wind a little chilly, and Mr& Podger took her    1.67495327387791
inside the fringe. Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree    1.6432600607208703
crickets, rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod.   Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen    1.7026049541338664
door opened and Pam burst out. "Dad"! she said. "It's    1.5636360329510388
getting so chilly we've lighted a fire, and we're going to tell    1.6432600607208703
a round robin story- a nice, scary one. We need you to start it. Why    1.7269387314284994
are you out here all by yourself? Aren't you happy"?   1.5636360329510388
Mr& Podger opened his cocoon and emerged, tucking Alacrity under    1.5636360329510388
his arm to bring her in by the fire. "Of course I am", he said.    1.7269387314284994
"Never happier in my life. I just came out here to know it".    1.67495327387791
_DALLAS_ As the South begins another school year, national and even    1.6065767145351917
world    1.0
attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial    1.5636360329510388
equality in the public schools.   Desegregation is beginning in    1.5127085093302464
two more important Southern cities- Dallas and Atlanta. In each    1.5636360329510388
city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public    1.6432600607208703
opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.   1.5127085093302464
These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully.    1.5127085093302464
The programs do not take sides on the issue itself. They point    1.6432600607208703
out simply that "it is the law of the land".   The two    1.6432600607208703
cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up    1.67495327387791
as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes    1.6432600607208703
of desegregation. Even better, they have the examples of Nashville    1.5636360329510388
and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.    1.5636360329510388
In each case there was an initial act of violence. In Nashville, a    1.67495327387791
school was dynamited. In Houston, there were a few incidents of friction    1.6432600607208703
between whites and Negroes, none of which were serious.   In    1.5636360329510388
each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government    1.6432600607208703
halted the threats of more serious incidents.   The Nashville    1.5127085093302464
plan, incidentally, has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable    1.5636360329510388
and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South.    1.67495327387791
It is a "stair-step" plan, in which desegregation begins in    1.5636360329510388
the first grade. Each year another grade is added to the process, until    1.67495327387791
finally all 12 grades are integrated. The schedules are flexible    1.5636360329510388
so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant    1.67495327387791
or realizes that it is something that has to be done, "so why    1.67495327387791
not now".   The program has worked well in both Nashville and    1.6065767145351917
Houston. It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans, where the two schools    1.67495327387791
selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by    1.5636360329510388
white parents. Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans    1.6432600607208703
to resume the program.   Generally, throughout the South,    1.4513752902486308
there is a    1.0
growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every    1.5636360329510388
step of desegregation is met.   Perhaps the most eloquent move    1.5636360329510388
toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas. During the summer,    1.6432600607208703
Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants    1.3761581156320553
and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments. It was part    1.5636360329510388
of a citywide move toward full integration.   So successful has    1.5636360329510388
been this program, worked out by white and Negro civic leaders, that    1.6432600607208703
further extensions are expected in the next few months. Hotels, for    1.6065767145351917
example, are ready to let down the bars. Already, at least one hotel    1.67495327387791
has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis. Several conventions    1.6065767145351917
have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated    1.6065767145351917
basis.   This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions    1.6065767145351917
which prevailed several years ago, when a series of bombings was directed    1.6432600607208703
against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods    1.5127085093302464
of Dallas.   It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude    1.6065767145351917
which appears to be spreading all across the South. Southern    1.5636360329510388
whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence    1.6432600607208703
to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights. They insist    1.6065767145351917
they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama    1.6432600607208703
when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination    1.5636360329510388
in local bus depots.   All across the South there are signs    1.6065767145351917
that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves    1.6065767145351917
would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant    1.6432600607208703
attitude toward it.   There are many causes for this change. One    1.6065767145351917
of the most important is economic. Business leaders are aware now    1.6065767145351917
that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence. They are putting    1.6432600607208703
strong pressure on their police departments to keep order. In the    1.6065767145351917
past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way.   1.6065767145351917
And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real sense of    1.6432600607208703
co-operation    1.0
has sprung up. This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites    1.5636360329510388
to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation. They    1.5636360329510388
realize that by acting in concert, rather than individually, they will    1.6065767145351917
not be picked out as objects of retaliation- economic and    1.5636360329510388
otherwise.   1.0
Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a    1.5636360329510388
few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship.    1.6432600607208703
Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles, it goes like    1.6065767145351917
this:   A driver cruising easily at 70 m&p&h& in Lane    1.5636360329510388
~A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead. Traffic    1.6432600607208703
in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes    1.67495327387791
a tentative fender into Lane ~B, which is heavily populated by cars    1.6432600607208703
also moving at 70 m&p&h&.   The adjacent driver in Lane    1.5636360329510388
~B has three choices open to him. He can (1) point his car resolutely    1.7026049541338664
at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane    1.6432600607208703
~A; (2) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes;    1.6432600607208703
or (3) alternately accelerate and decelerate, thus keeping the    1.5127085093302464
first driver guessing as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating    1.6065767145351917
sport of the whole affair.   The really remarkable thing to    1.5636360329510388
me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down    1.6065767145351917
and permit the invading car free access. Whether or not this is done    1.67495327387791
out of enlightened self-preservation, I don't know. But it is done,    1.6065767145351917
This    1.0
could never happen in my native Chicago. There such soggy acquiesence    1.6065767145351917
would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood. In    1.6432600607208703
Chicago, the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor    1.7026049541338664
in an effort to force the other car back. Failing this, he would pull    1.7026049541338664
alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.   1.5636360329510388
This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways, however,    1.5127085093302464
does an injustice to Southern California drivers. At the risk    1.5636360329510388
of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company, I would    1.6065767145351917
like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype. After three months    1.6065767145351917
of research, I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are    1.6065767145351917
considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've    1.5636360329510388
ever encountered.   During one recent day of driving about Los    1.5636360329510388
Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers    1.5636360329510388
stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible    1.7269387314284994
side street.    1.0
_MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17._ An out-of-town writer came up to Paul    1.6065767145351917
Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball    1.6432600607208703
club would be improved this year.   Now Richards, of course, is    1.6065767145351917
known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go. He can often make the    1.7026049541338664
complex ridiculously simple, and vice versa. This happened to be    1.5636360329510388
vice versa, but even so, the answer    1.3761581156320553
was a masterpiece.   "It's a whole lot easier", he said,    1.5636360329510388
"to increase the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the    1.6432600607208703
population of New York city". And with that he walked off to give    1.67495327387791
instruction to a rookie pitcher.   "That is undoubtedly a hell    1.5636360329510388
of a quote", said the writer, scratching his head. "Now, if I    1.6432600607208703
can just figure out what he's talking about, I'll use it".    1.6065767145351917
This was just Richard's way of saying that last    1.5127085093302464
year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open.    1.67495327387791
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down, so that this spring just two    1.6432600607208703
spots, left and right field, are really up for grabs.   It should    1.6432600607208703
be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots    1.7026049541338664
that were open last year, but so far it hasn't worked that way.   1.67495327387791
This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this    1.6432600607208703
year is an interesting one. You'd never guess it from the way they've    1.67495327387791
played so far this spring, but there remains a feeling among some    1.6432600607208703
around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the    1.67495327387791
pennant in 1961.   Obviously, if this club is going to move from    1.6432600607208703
second to first in the American League, it will have to show improvement    1.67495327387791
someplace. Where can that improvement possibly come from?   1.4513752902486308
You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than    1.6065767145351917
it did last year.    1.0
Brooks Robinson is great,    1.0
and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he    1.67495327387791
did in 1960. You can't expect it, though. Robby's performance last    1.6065767145351917
year was tremendous.   It's the same with Ron Hansen and    1.5636360329510388
jim Gentile. If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no    1.748515906000203
complaint. They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.   1.6432600607208703
Hansen will be getting a late spring training start, which might    1.6065767145351917
very well set him back. He got off to an exceptional start last season,    1.7026049541338664
and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.   1.4513752902486308
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching    1.6065767145351917
to him last year. They don't expect to stop him, just slow him    1.67495327387791
down some with the bat. He'll still be a top player, they concede,    1.67495327387791
because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him. But    1.7026049541338664
they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production.    1.4513752902486308
Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.    1.5636360329510388
Don't ask him more.   I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move    1.6432600607208703
up a notch. But even so, he had a good year in 1960 and won't do    1.748515906000203
too much better.   So, all in all, the infield can't be expected    1.6432600607208703
to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second    1.6065767145351917
to first.   And the pitching will also have trouble doing better.    1.6065767145351917
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and    1.6432600607208703
experience last season.   Where, then, can we look for improvement?   1.5636360329510388
"From Triandos, Brandt and Walker", answers Richards.    1.3761581156320553
"They're the ones we can expect to do better".   The    1.5636360329510388
man is right, and at this time, indications are that these three are    1.67495327387791
ready for better seasons.   Triandos hasn't proved it yet, but    1.5636360329510388
he says he's convinced his thumb is all right. He jammed it this    1.67495327387791
spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old injury hasn't bothered    1.7269387314284994
him. If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years,    1.7026049541338664
the club will have to be better off offensively.   I'm still    1.6065767145351917
not convinced, though, I'll have to see more of him before predicting    1.6432600607208703
that big year for him. Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House    1.6432600607208703
who will be within calling distance in the minors, make up better second    1.67495327387791
line catching than the Birds had all last year, but Gus is still    1.67495327387791
that big man you need when you start talking pennant.   To me,    1.6432600607208703
Brandt    1.0
looks as though he could be in for a fine year. He hasn't played    1.7026049541338664
too much, because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting    1.6432600607208703
practice. He's hitting the ball hard, in the batting cage, and    1.6065767145351917
his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.   When    1.6065767145351917
he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team which was supposed to win    1.7026049541338664
the National League pennant, and he was joining what seemed to be    1.6432600607208703
a second division American League club. He was down, hard to talk    1.6432600607208703
to,    1.0
and far too nonchalant on the field. As of now, that all seems behind    1.7026049541338664
him. He's been entirely different all spring.   And Walker    1.5127085093302464
looks stronger, seems to be throwing better than he did last year. Let    1.67495327387791
him bounce back, and he could really set up the staff.   So,    1.6432600607208703
if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos and Walker will have    1.6432600607208703
to do it.   So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't    1.67495327387791
seem capable of carrying the load.   Of course, this isn't    1.5636360329510388
taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York    1.5636360329510388
city, but it's the way things look from here at this point.   1.6432600607208703
Is the mother of an "autistic" child at fault? (The "autistic"    1.6065767145351917
child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self.    1.6432600607208703
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects-    1.67495327387791
and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people.) Did his    1.6432600607208703
mother make him this way?   Some people believe she did.   1.5636360329510388
We think differently. We believe that autism, like so many other conditions    1.6432600607208703
of defect and deviation, is to a large extent inborn. A mother    1.6432600607208703
can help a child adapt to his difficulties.   Sometimes she    1.5636360329510388
can- to a large extent- help him overcome them. But we don't think    1.67495327387791
she creates them. We don't think she can make her child defective,    1.6432600607208703
emotionally disturbed or autistic.   The mother of a difficult    1.5127085093302464
child can do a great deal to help her own child and often, by sharing    1.7269387314284994
her experiences, she can help other mothers with the same problem.    1.6065767145351917
Since little is known about autism, and almost nothing has been written    1.6432600607208703
for the layman, we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments.    1.6065767145351917
She wrote:    1.0
"As the mother of an autistic    1.2818970554302986
child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything,    1.6065767145351917
I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he    1.6065767145351917
first    1.0
plays with a new toy. He wants me to do everything for him.   "You    1.7026049541338664
don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of    1.5127085093302464
something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats    1.67495327387791
them. But I do and my psychiatrist does, too. I know, that my    1.67495327387791
son wants control and direction, but being autistic myself I cannot give    1.6432600607208703
full control or direction.   "One thing I notice which I    1.5636360329510388
have seldom heard mentioned. This is that autistic people don't enjoy    1.6065767145351917
physical contact with others- for instance, my children and I.    1.5636360329510388
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is    1.748515906000203
as straight and stiff as a board. He pushes and straightens himself    1.6432600607208703
as if he can't stand the feeling of being held. Physical contact is    1.67495327387791
uncomforatble for him"!   This mother is quite correct. As    1.5127085093302464
a rule, the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others.    1.6065767145351917
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him. For the young    1.6432600607208703
child this may be no more than providing food, light or movement. As    1.67495327387791
he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object    1.67495327387791
(his "magic" thing). Or certain words or rituals that child and    1.6065767145351917
adult go through may do the trick. The answer is different for each autistic    1.7026049541338664
child, but for most there is an answer. Only ingenuity will uncover    1.6432600607208703
it.    1.0
"Dear Doctors: We learned this    1.1606783668269585
year that our older son, Daniel, is autistic. We did not accept the    1.67495327387791
diagnosis at once, but gradually we are coming to. Fortunately, there    1.6065767145351917
is a nursery school which he has been able to attend, with a group    1.7026049541338664
of normal children.   "I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal,    1.67495327387791
though of course I realize he is far from that at present. What    1.67495327387791
I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible.    1.748515906000203
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible.   1.6065767145351917
"What is your experience with autistic children? How do they    1.5636360329510388
turn out later"?   Many autistic children grow up to lead    1.5636360329510388
relatively normal lives. Certainly, most continue to lack a certain warmth    1.6065767145351917
in communication with other people, but many adjust to school, even    1.6065767145351917
college, to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood.    1.5127085093302464
_QUESTION_- <A first grader colors pictures one solid color,    1.5127085093302464
everything- sky, grass, boy, wagon, etc&. When different colors    1.5127085093302464
are used, she is just as likely to color trees purple, hair green,    1.67495327387791

I show my daughter how things should be colored? She is an aggressive,    1.67495327387791
nervous child. Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help    1.5636360329510388
her outgrow these traits?> _ANSWER_- Her choice of one color    1.5636360329510388
means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring, without having    1.6432600607208703
reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.    1.5636360329510388
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature    1.67495327387791
for the first grade.   No, coloring isn't exactly something    1.5127085093302464
you teach a child. You sometimes give them a little demonstration,    1.6065767145351917
a little guidance, and suggestions about staying inside the lines. But    1.6065767145351917
most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only    1.7026049541338664
a very little demonstration.   1.0
SEEN in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest    1.5636360329510388
in an old art: embroidery. Possibly responsible for this is the incoming    1.6432600607208703
trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms, which seems slated to    1.5636360329510388
replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed. Just as    1.6432600607208703
a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme,    1.67495327387791
so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.   One such,    1.6065767145351917
in fact, is a rug. Though not actually crewel embroidery, it has    1.6432600607208703
that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue, pink, bronze    1.6065767145351917
and gold and a sauterne background. The twirled, stylized design of    1.6065767145351917
winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns    1.5636360329510388
used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in    1.5636360329510388
England.   Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing    1.5127085093302464
more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available    1.67495327387791
in this country. The work is executed in England (by hand) and    1.6432600607208703
can be worked in any desired design and color.   Among some recent    1.6432600607208703
imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on    1.6432600607208703
which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens    1.5636360329510388
and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color.    1.6432600607208703
For a particularly fabulous room which houses    1.3761581156320553
a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture, fabric wall panels    1.5636360329510388
were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this    1.5127085093302464
revered Eighteenth Century period. Since the work is done by hand,    1.6065767145351917
the only limitation, it is said, "is that of human conception".   1.6065767145351917
Modern embroidered panels, framed and meant to be hung on the    1.6065767145351917
wall, are another aspect of this trend. These have never gone out of    1.67495327387791
style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and    1.6432600607208703
there in shops which specialize in handicrafts. An amateur decorator    1.5636360329510388
might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings, and, by    1.7026049541338664
picking up her living room color scheme, add a decorative do-it-yourself    1.6065767145351917
note to the room.   1.0

top-drawer Democrats from all over the country. _2_- Blueprints    1.5127085093302464
for doubling the ~CDC's present 55,000 enrollment. _3_-    1.4513752902486308
Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in    1.4513752902486308
Fresno next Jan& 26-28. _4_- And proposals for a whole series    1.6065767145351917
of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional    1.5636360329510388
districts.   At the head of the ~CDC is an unorthodox,    1.5636360329510388
39-year-old amateur politico, Thomas B& Carvey Jr&,    1.3761581156320553
whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon    1.5127085093302464
missiles. He's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering    1.5127085093302464
Viewed from afar, the ~CDC looks like    1.3761581156320553
a rather stalwart political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out    1.5636360329510388
into an array of district leaders and standing committees, and thence    1.6065767145351917
into its component clubs and affiliated groups- 500 or so.    1.5636360329510388
Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every    1.6065767145351917
"volunteer" Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to    1.4513752902486308
Moreover, the entire state Democratic hierarchy,    1.2818970554302986
from Gov& Brown on down to the county chairmen, also participates    1.6065767145351917
in this huge operation.   Contrarily, Republican "volunteers"    1.3761581156320553
go their separate ways, and thus far have given no indication    1.6065767145351917
that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate,    1.6065767145351917
except in the most loose-knit fashion.   Carvey believes that    1.5127085093302464
reapportionment,    1.0
which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district    1.5636360329510388
boundaries, actually will increase ~CDC membership. Where    1.3761581156320553
only one club existed before, he says, two will flourish henceforth.   1.6065767145351917
Biggest organizational problem, he adds, is setting up ~CDC    1.5127085093302464
units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory. Paradoxically the council    1.4513752902486308
is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's    1.6432600607208703
favor, strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly    1.5636360329510388
even basis.   Like most Democratic spokesmen, Carvey predicts    1.4513752902486308
1962 will be a tremendously "partisan year". Hence the attention    1.5636360329510388
they're lavishing on the ~CDC.   In all probability, the    1.5127085093302464
council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for    1.6065767145351917
Congress, and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary    1.6432600607208703
favorites. This bodes heated contests in several districts where    1.5127085093302464
claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't    1.6065767145351917
see eye-to-eye with the ~CDC.   Naturally, the statewide    1.4513752902486308
races will provide the major test for the expanding council.   Shunted    1.6065767145351917
aside by the rampant organizers for John F& Kennedy last    1.5636360329510388
year, who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential    1.6432600607208703
campaign, the ~CDC plainly intends to provide the party's    1.5127085093302464
campaign muscle in 1962. There is evidence that it will be happily received    1.67495327387791
Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's    1.5636360329510388
most formidable foe, with ex-Gov& Knight a close second.    1.5127085093302464
But the rest of the ~GOP gubernatorial aspirants don't worry    1.5636360329510388
him very much.   In his ~CDC work, Carvey has the close-in    1.6065767145351917
support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists:    1.5636360329510388
former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren,    1.2818970554302986
who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty& Gen&    1.6065767145351917
Stanley Mosk. (Significantly, bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle    1.5636360329510388
that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren    1.6065767145351917
NOTE: We've    1.0
just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment    1.5636360329510388
organizing convention Wednesday night in South    1.2818970554302986
Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg&, which graphically illustrates the    1.4513752902486308
~CDC's broad appeal. State Sen& Dick Richards will keynote;    1.5127085093302464
state and county    1.0
committeemen, ~CDC directors and representatives,    1.1606783668269585
members of 16 area clubs, and "all residents" have been invited.   1.6065767145351917
This is going to be a language lesson, and you can master it in    1.7026049541338664
a few minutes. It is a short course in Communese.   It works    1.6432600607208703
with English, Russian, German, Hungarian or almost any other foreign    1.5636360329510388
tongue. Once you learn how to translate Communese, much of each    1.6065767145351917
day's deluge of news will become clearer. At least, I have found it    1.67495327387791
For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated    1.4513752902486308
Dr& Freud, Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably    1.5636360329510388
impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves. They    1.6065767145351917
accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves    1.6065767145351917
are most guilty.   President Kennedy's latest warning to the    1.5127085093302464
Communist world that the United States will build up its military    1.6065767145351917
strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly,    1.6432600607208703
reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the    1.5636360329510388
Iron Curtain. Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces    1.6065767145351917
with striking consistency.   Now listen closely:    1.2818970554302986
Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England:    1.5636360329510388
"President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals,    1.4513752902486308
to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat, as part of    1.67495327387791
the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism. Evidently    1.6065767145351917
the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred    1.5636360329510388
up in the West have been planned long in advance. The West Berlin    1.67495327387791
crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the    1.6432600607208703
United States to justify its arms drive".   The Soviet news    1.5636360329510388
agency ~TASS datelined from New York in English to Europe:   1.5636360329510388
"President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military    1.3761581156320553
program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American    1.6432600607208703
munitions industry. When the stock exchange opened this morning,    1.5127085093302464
many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas, Lockheed and    1.6065767145351917
United Aircraft and prices rose substantially. Over 4 million shares    1.5636360329510388
were sold, the highest figures since early June. (Quotations follow".)   1.5636360329510388
~TASS datelined Los Angeles, in English to Europe:   1.4513752902486308
"Former Vice President Nixon came out in support of    1.5127085093302464
President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race. He also    1.6065767145351917
demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international    1.5127085093302464
tension: specifically to crush the Cuban revolution, resume    1.4513752902486308
nuclear testing, resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful    1.6065767145351917
seat in the United Nations, and postpone non-military programs at    1.5636360329510388
home".   ~TASS from Moscow in English to Europe:   1.4513752902486308
"The American press clamored for many days promising President    1.5127085093302464
Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems    1.6065767145351917
confronting the United States. In fact, the world heard nothing    1.5636360329510388
but sabre-rattling, the same exercises which proved futile for the    1.5636360329510388
predecessors of the current President. If there were no West Berlin    1.6065767145351917
problem, imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping    1.5636360329510388
up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems    1.67495327387791
besetting the United States and its ~NATO partners. Washington    1.5127085093302464
apparently decided to use an old formula, by injecting large    1.5636360329510388
military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U&S& economy    1.6065767145351917
And now, for Communist    1.0
listeners and readers:   Moscow Radio in Russian to the ~USSR:   1.5636360329510388
"The U&S& President has shown once again that    1.4513752902486308
the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis    1.6065767145351917
to justify the armaments race. As was to be expected Kennedy's latest    1.6432600607208703
speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn,    1.5636360329510388
where officials of the West German government praised it".   1.5127085093302464
Moscow Novosti article in Russian, datelined London:   1.3761581156320553
"U&S& pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status    1.6065767145351917
of West Berlin has reached its apogee. British common sense is    1.6065767145351917
proverbial. The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate    1.5127085093302464
ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to    1.6065767145351917
pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures".    1.6432600607208703
East Berlin (Communist) radio in German to Germany:   1.4513752902486308
"A better position for negotiations is the real point    1.5127085093302464
of this speech. Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West    1.67495327387791
Berlin, neither conventional nor nuclear, and negotiations will come    1.5127085093302464
as certainly as the peace treaty. Whenever some Washington circles    1.5636360329510388
were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always    1.6065767145351917
succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn.    1.67495327387791
In Kennedy's speech are cross currents, sensible ones and senseless    1.5636360329510388
ones, reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's    1.5636360329510388
advisers and the political and economic forces behind them.    1.5127085093302464
Well, dear listeners, despite all the shouting, there will be no war    1.6432600607208703
over West Berlin".   Moscow ~TASS in Russian datelined    1.4513752902486308
Sochi:   "Chairman Khrushchev received the U&S& President's    1.3761581156320553
disarmament adviser, John McCloy. Their conversation    1.2818970554302986
and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere".   Now,    1.5636360329510388
to translate from the Communese, this means:   The "West Berlin"    1.5636360329510388
The crisis    1.0
was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin (Wall Street) and the    1.6065767145351917
Red Army (Pentagon) egged on by the West Germans (East Germans).   1.6065767145351917
The reason was to speed up domestic production in the ~USSR,    1.6065767145351917
which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power, and try to end    1.5636360329510388
the permanent recession in Russian living standards.   Chairman    1.4513752902486308
Khrushchev (Kennedy) rattles his rockets (sabre) in order to cure    1.5636360329510388
his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position. His advisers    1.6065767145351917
in the Politburo (White House) are engaged in a great struggle    1.6065767145351917
of opinions, so he is not always consistent.   The Soviet Union    1.6065767145351917
will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin,    1.6065767145351917
and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies. The West has no intention    1.6432600607208703
of attacking Russia.   Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy    1.4513752902486308
had a terrible row at Sochi.   See, Communese is easy- once    1.6065767145351917
you get onto it.   1.0
Aug& 4, 1821, nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded    1.5636360329510388
the Pennsylvania Gazette- a century during which it had undergone    1.5636360329510388
several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication-    1.6065767145351917
this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening    1.5636360329510388
Post. The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C& Atkinson    1.6432600607208703
and Charles Alexander, who had just taken over Franklin's    1.5127085093302464
old paper, desired a more distinctive name.   When founded by Franklin    1.6065767145351917
the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name    1.6432600607208703
its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually    1.6065767145351917
contained more and more fiction, poetry, and literary essays. In the    1.6065767145351917
middle of the century, with a circulation of 90,000, the Post was one    1.67495327387791
of the most popular weeklies in the country. But during the second half    1.67495327387791
of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus    1.7026049541338664
H& K& Curtis purchased it- "paper, type, and all"-    1.5127085093302464
for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and    1.6432600607208703
initialed miscellany, and with only some 2,000 subscribers.   Little    1.5127085093302464
more than a fine old name, valuable principally because of the    1.6065767145351917
Franklin tradition, the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive.    1.5636360329510388
But Curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became    1.7026049541338664
one of the most popular weeklies of the country.   1.5127085093302464
"Remember the French railroad baron who was going to take me    1.6065767145351917
floating down the Nile"? **h "Remember the night Will Rogers    1.5636360329510388
filled a tooth for me between numbers"? **h "Sure, we met a    1.6432600607208703
barrel of rich men but it's hard to find the real thing when you're    1.7026049541338664
young, beautiful and the toast of two continents" **h "Remember    1.5636360329510388
Fanny Brice promised my mother she would look after me on the road"?   1.67495327387791
All this remembering took place the other night when I    1.5636360329510388
had supper with the Ziegfeld Girls at the Beverly Hills Club.   1.6065767145351917
A quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy of walking dreams    1.7026049541338664
sashayed up and down the staircases of the old New Amsterdam Theater,    1.6432600607208703

Janssen, Mrs& Robert Jarvis, Mrs& Walter Adams order low-calory    1.5127085093302464
seafood, no bread, I could see the Ziegfeld Girls of 1920    1.6065767145351917
were determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961.   I was    1.5636360329510388
anxious to hear about those dazzling days on the Great White Way. All    1.67495327387791
I could remember was Billie Dove pasted over the ceiling of my    1.6432600607208703
big brother's room.   "Billie was really beautiful"! exclaimed    1.4513752902486308
Vera Forbes Adams, batting lovely big eyes behind glitter rimmed    1.5636360329510388
glasses.   1.0
SING SING'S prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable    1.5127085093302464
purpose, a fair break from parole boards. But once the strike trend    1.6432600607208703
hits hoosegows, there is no telling how far it may go. Inmates might    1.67495327387791
even demand the 34-hour week, all holidays off and fringe benefits including    1.6432600607208703
state contributions toward lawyers' fees. Some day we might    1.5127085093302464
see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates, with a leader busily    1.6432600607208703
trying to organize reformatory occupants, defendants out on bail, convicts    1.5636360329510388
opposed to probation officers, etc&. _@_ A three-day confinement    1.4513752902486308
week, with a month's vacation and shorter hours all around    1.5636360329510388
could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation, with    1.6432600607208703
fringe benefits including: _1._ Wider space between iron bars    1.5127085093302464
and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of    1.67495327387791
metal. _2._ An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks    1.6432600607208703
used on prison doors. In case of a deadlock between prison boards    1.6432600607208703
and inmates, a federal arbitration board to include a "lifer" and    1.6065767145351917
two escapees should decide the issue. _3._ Specific broadening of    1.5636360329510388
travel rights. _4._ The right to leave the hoosegow any time to    1.6432600607208703
see a lawyer instead of waiting for a lawyer to make a trip to the prison.    1.748515906000203
_5._ Recognition of Prisoners Union rule that no member of    1.5636360329510388
an iron or steel workers union be permitted to repair a sawed-off bar    1.67495327387791
without approval and participation of representative of the cell occupant.    1.5636360329510388
_6._ No warden or guard to touch lock, key or doorknob except    1.6432600607208703
when accompanied by a prisoners' committee with powers of veto.    1.5636360329510388

Harold A& Stevens, oldest of the Stevens brothers, famed operators    1.5636360329510388
of baseball, football and race track concessions, revived again the    1.5636360329510388
story of one of the greatest business successes in history. Harold,    1.6065767145351917
with brothers Frank, Joe and William, took over at the death of their    1.67495327387791
father, Harry M& Stevens, who put a few dollars into a baseball    1.6432600607208703
program, introduced the "hot dog" and paved the way for creation    1.6065767145351917

THE 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being    1.5636360329510388
celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament,    1.5636360329510388
the first part of the New English Bible, undertaken as a new    1.6432600607208703
translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English.   Since    1.4513752902486308
it was issued in the spring of 1611, the King James Version has    1.67495327387791
been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations    1.6432600607208703
of the Bible. However, Biblical scholars frequently attested    1.4513752902486308
to its numerous inaccuracies, as old manuscripts were uncovered    1.5127085093302464
and scholarship advanced.   This resulted in revisions of the King    1.5636360329510388
James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in    1.6065767145351917
1901 as the American Standard Version. Then in 1937 America's    1.5636360329510388
International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision,    1.5127085093302464
in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages.    1.6065767145351917
Undertaken by 32 American scholars, under the chairmanship    1.4513752902486308
of Rev& Dr& Luther A& Weigle, former dean of Yale University    1.6065767145351917
Divinity School, their studies resulted in the publishing of the    1.5636360329510388
Revised Standard Version, 1946-52.    1.0
The New English    1.0
Bible (the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a    1.6065767145351917
future date) has not been planned to rival or replace the King James    1.67495327387791
Version, but, as its cover states, it is offered "simply as the Bible    1.67495327387791
to all those who will use it in reading, teaching, or worship".   1.6432600607208703
Time, of course will testify whether the new version will have    1.6065767145351917
achieved its purpose. Bible reading, even more so than good classical    1.6065767145351917
music, grows in depth and meaning upon repetition.   If this    1.5636360329510388
new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout    1.6065767145351917
the years, it will not survive the ages as has the King James    1.67495327387791
Version.   However, an initial perusal and comparison of some    1.5127085093302464
of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to    1.67495327387791
speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars. One is    1.6432600607208703
impressed with the dignity, clarity and beauty of this new translation    1.6065767145351917
into contemporary English, and there is no doubt that the meaning of    1.6432600607208703
the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary    1.6432600607208703
language than in the frequently    1.1606783668269585
archaic words and phrases of the    1.2818970554302986
King James.   For example, in the third chapter of Matthew, verses    1.6065767145351917
13-16, describing the baptism of Jesus, the 1611 version reads:   1.5636360329510388
"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John,    1.5127085093302464
to be baptized of him.   "But John forbad him, saying, I have    1.6432600607208703
need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?   "And    1.6432600607208703
Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it    1.7026049541338664
becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.   1.5636360329510388
"And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway out of the    1.6432600607208703
water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit    1.7026049541338664
of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him".    1.5636360329510388
Certainly, the meaning is clearer to one who is not    1.5636360329510388
familiar with Biblical teachings, in the New English Bible which reads:    1.6065767145351917
"Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee, and he came    1.5636360329510388
to John to be baptized by him. John tried to dissuade him. 'Do you    1.7026049541338664
come to me'? he said; 'I need rather to be baptized by you'.    1.67495327387791
Jesus replied, 'let it be so for the present; we do well to    1.67495327387791
conform this way with all that God requires'. John then allowed him    1.6432600607208703
to come. After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once, and    1.7026049541338664
at that moment heaven opened; he saw the Spirit of God descending    1.6432600607208703
like a dove to alight upon him";   (the paragraphing, spelling    1.5636360329510388
and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version.)    1.5127085093302464
Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes    1.5636360329510388
and yet so few persons, other than scholars, really understand the    1.6065767145351917
true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning    1.6432600607208703
of the Sermon on the Mount.   To illustrate, the first blessing    1.6065767145351917
in the King James Bible reads: "Blessed are the poor in    1.6065767145351917
spirit; for their's is the kingdom of heaven". The new version    1.6065767145351917
states: "How blest are those who know that they are poor; the    1.6432600607208703
kingdom of Heaven is theirs".   Some of the poetic cadence of    1.6065767145351917
the older version certainly is lost in the newer one, but almost anyone,    1.67495327387791
with a fair knowledge of the English language, can understand the    1.6065767145351917
meaning, without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar.    1.5636360329510388
To a novice    1.0
that is significant.   In the second and third    1.4513752902486308
chapters of Revelation the new version retains, however, the old phrase    1.6065767145351917
"angel of the church" which Biblical scholars have previously    1.5127085093302464
interpreted as meaning bishop. This is not contemporary English.    1.5127085093302464
For the most part, however, the new version is    1.5127085093302464
contemporary and, as such, should be the means for many to attain a    1.67495327387791
clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds    1.6432600607208703
of years ago by the first followers of Christ.   Originally    1.5636360329510388
recorded by hand, these words have been copied and recopied, translated    1.6065767145351917
and retranslated through the ages. Discoveries recently made of    1.5127085093302464
old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings,    1.6065767145351917
some by the early church fathers, in themselves called for a restudy    1.6432600607208703
of the Bible. To have the results recorded in everyday usable    1.6065767145351917
English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.   There    1.6432600607208703
is one danger, however. With contemporary English changing with the    1.5636360329510388
rapidity that marks this jet age, some of the words and phrases of the    1.7026049541338664
new version may themselves soon become archaic. The only answer will    1.6065767145351917
be continuous study.   The New Testament offered to the public    1.5636360329510388
today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up    1.7026049541338664
of representatives of the Church of England, Church of Scotland,    1.5636360329510388

Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but    1.5127085093302464
kind to the feet. That is why it is important to invest in comfortable,    1.7026049541338664
airy types of shoes.   There are many soft and light shoe    1.6065767145351917
leathers available. Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness    1.5636360329510388
achieved via unlined leathers. Softness is found in crushed    1.5127085093302464
textures.   Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with    1.5636360329510388
elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape. Heels place emphasis on    1.6432600607208703
the    1.0
long legged silhouette. Wine glass heels are to be found in both high    1.67495327387791
and semi-heights. Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored    1.6065767145351917
shoes. Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage    1.6432600607208703
pumps.    1.0
While white is the coolest summer shade,    1.3761581156320553
there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend    1.67495327387791
with any wardrobe color.   In the tintable group are high and    1.6065767145351917
little heels, squared and oval throats, and shantung-like textures.   1.5127085093302464
Don't overlook the straws this year. They come in crisp basket    1.6065767145351917
weaves in natural honey hues, along with lacey open weaves with a    1.6432600607208703
lustre finish in natural, white, black and a whole range of colors. In    1.67495327387791
the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in    1.67495327387791
a variety of styles. For added comfort some of the Italian designed    1.6432600607208703
sandals have foam padded cushioning.   The citrus tones popular    1.5127085093302464
in clothing are also to be found afoot. Orange and lemon are considered    1.67495327387791
important as are such pastels as blue and lilac. In a brighter nautical    1.67495327387791
vein is Ille de France blue. Contrast trim provides other touches    1.6065767145351917
of color. Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel    1.6065767145351917
in smooth black, navy and taffy tan.    1.3761581156320553
Designed    1.0
for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated. At the left is a pair    1.67495327387791
of dressy straw pumps in a light, but crisp texture. In a lacey open    1.7026049541338664
weave shoes have a luster finish, braided collar and bow highlight on    1.6432600607208703
the squared throat. At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined    1.67495327387791
white leather. Flats have a scalloped throat.   1.3761581156320553
An electric toothbrush (Broxodent) may soon take its place next    1.5636360329510388
to the electric razor in the American bathroom. The brush moves up    1.6432600607208703
and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface, including    1.6432600607208703
the back of the teeth. In addition, the motor has the seal of approval    1.7026049541338664
of the Underwriters Laboratories, which means it is safe.    1.5127085093302464
The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged    1.748515906000203
in. The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons    1.6432600607208703
located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the    1.6432600607208703
motor. The bushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable    1.67495327387791
so that every member of the family can have his own.    1.6065767145351917
Most of us brush our teeth by hand. The same can be said of shaving    1.7269387314284994
yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men.   The electric    1.6432600607208703
toothbrush moves in a vertical direction, the way dentists recommend.    1.5636360329510388
In addition, it is small enough to get into crevices, jacket and    1.6432600607208703
crown margins, malposed anteriors, and the back teeth. The bristles    1.5636360329510388
are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel.   1.6432600607208703
It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary    1.6432600607208703
bushing, especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly.    1.6065767145351917
Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented    1.5636360329510388
with the device. The results were good although they are difficult    1.6065767145351917
to compare with hand brushing, particularly when the individual    1.5127085093302464
knows how to brush his teeth properly. The electric gadget is most helpful    1.67495327387791
when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly,    1.6432600607208703
bedfast with a chronic disease, or are handicapped by disorders    1.5636360329510388
such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.   But for many of    1.6065767145351917
us, it will prove an enjoyable luxury. It is not as convenient as the    1.7026049541338664
old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy of the bristles. Since    1.67495327387791
the apparatus is new, it requires experimentation and changes in    1.5636360329510388
technique.    1.0

when sewing? _REPLY_ There are many possibilities, including    1.4513752902486308
poor circulation, a variety of neurological conditions, and functional    1.5127085093302464
disorders. This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis    1.6065767145351917
or the beginning of sewer's cramp.    1.2818970554302986

might help, depending upon the cause of sciatica.    1.4513752902486308
@ writes: Does the cholesterol go down when most of    1.5127085093302464
the thyroid gland is removed? _REPLY_ No. It usually goes up.    1.6065767145351917
The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the    1.67495327387791
body. It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland    1.7026049541338664
is sluggish. The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed.   1.67495327387791
The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller    1.6065767145351917
with each new recording catalogue.   There's more reading    1.4513752902486308
and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before, although the spoken    1.67495327387791
rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's    1.6432600607208703
first experiment in recorded sound. Edison could hardly have guessed,    1.5636360329510388
however, that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo.   If    1.5636360329510388
the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest    1.6065767145351917
bit esoteric, he will find them satisfied on educational records. And    1.6065767145351917
he will avoid eye-strain in the process.   Everything from poetry    1.5636360329510388
to phonetics, history to histrionics, philosophy to party games    1.5127085093302464
has been adapted to the turntable.   For sheer ambition, take the    1.6065767145351917
Decca series titled modestly "Wisdom". Volumes One and Two,    1.5127085093302464
selected from the sound tracks of a television series, contain "conversations    1.6065767145351917
with the elder wise men of our day".   These sages    1.5636360329510388
include poet Carl Sandburg, statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor    1.5127085093302464
Jacques Lipchitz, in Volume One, and playwright Sean O'Casey,    1.5127085093302464
David Ben-Gurion, philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank    1.5127085093302464
Lloyd Wright in the second set. Hugh Downs is heard interviewing    1.6065767145351917
Wright, for an added prestige fillip.   There's more specialization    1.5127085093302464
and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover    1.6065767145351917
Publications. Dover "publishes" what the company calls "Listen    1.4513752902486308
and Learn" productions designed to teach foreign languages.    1.4513752902486308
Previous presentations have been on French, Spanish, Russian, Italian,    1.5127085093302464
German and Japanese.   But the firm has recognized the tight    1.5636360329510388
dollar and the tourist's desire to visit the "smaller, less-traveled    1.5636360329510388
and relatively inexpensive countries", and is now prepared to    1.5127085093302464
teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings. The respective    1.5127085093302464
vocabularies "essential for travel" are available in separate    1.4513752902486308
albums.   Thanks to Spoken Arts Records, history buffs may hear    1.5636360329510388
Lincoln's "most memorable speeches and letters" in a two-disc    1.5127085093302464
set, interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P& Basler.    1.5636360329510388
As a comtemporary bonus, the set includes Carl Sandburg's address    1.5636360329510388
at a joint session of Congress, delivered on Lincoln's birthday    1.5636360329510388
two years ago.   For those who "like poetry but never get    1.6065767145351917
around to reading it", the Library of Congress makes it possible    1.6065767145351917
for poets to be heard reading their own work. The program was instituted    1.67495327387791
in 1940, and releases are available only from the Recording Laboratory    1.6065767145351917
of the Library of Congress, Washington 25, D& C& A catalogue    1.6065767145351917
is available on request.   Newest on the list are John    1.5636360329510388
Ciardi, W& D& Snodgrass, I& A& Richards, Oscar Williams,    1.5127085093302464
Robert Hillyer, John Hall Wheelock, Stephen Vincent Benet,    1.4513752902486308
Edwin Muir, John Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim. Two poets    1.5636360329510388
are paired on each record, in the order given above.   Decca is    1.6432600607208703
not the only large commercial company to impart instruction. ~RCA    1.5636360329510388
Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called    1.6432600607208703
"Adventures in Music", which is an instructional record library    1.5127085093302464
for elementary schools. Howard Mitchell and the National Symphony    1.5127085093302464
perform in the first two releases, designed for grades one and two. Teaching    1.67495327387791
guides are included with each record.   1.2818970554302986
In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure    1.6065767145351917
to arise in the future, Herbert A& Leggett, banker-editor of    1.5636360329510388
the Phoenix "Arizona Progress", reflects upon a few of the depressing    1.6065767145351917
experiences of the feverish fifties.   One of the roughest    1.5127085093302464
was the    1.0
~TV quiz shows, which gave him inferiority complexes. Though    1.5127085093302464
it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out    1.7026049541338664
to be frauds and phonies, it did irreparable damage to the ego of the    1.7026049541338664
editor and many another intelligent, well-informed American.    1.3761581156320553
But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer    1.6432600607208703
who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000    1.67495327387791
profit on the stock market. Every man who dabbles in the market to    1.67495327387791
make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time    1.7269387314284994
hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so    1.67495327387791
dumb. Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic    1.6432600607208703
dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book    1.6432600607208703
to make some dough.   People who take us for suckers are like    1.6432600607208703
the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form    1.6432600607208703
of a number of bull's-eye achievements. The promoter who wanted    1.5636360329510388
to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it. His    1.7677783654484436
answer was simple but honest. He just shot at the board and then drew    1.7026049541338664
circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye.   1.4513752902486308
One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child    1.6432600607208703
is a lack of verbal communication. The child understands no. He senses    1.6432600607208703
his mother's disapproval. But explanations leave him confused and    1.5127085093302464
unmoved.   If his mother loves him, he clings to that love as    1.6432600607208703
a ballast. It motivates his behavior. He wants Mommy to think him    1.6432600607208703
a good boy. He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him, or speak    1.7026049541338664
to him angrily. This breaks his heart. He wants to be called sweet,    1.67495327387791
good, considerate and mother's little helper. But even mother's    1.5127085093302464
loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.   His desires    1.5127085093302464
are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's    1.6065767145351917
love for him and what she expects of him, in order to overcome them.    1.7026049541338664
His own inner voice, which should tell him what not to do, has not developed.    1.7269387314284994
It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it.    1.6432600607208703
The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old.   What can    1.5127085093302464
a mother do then to prevent misbehavior? She can decrease the number    1.6432600607208703
of temptations. She can remove all knick-knacks within reach. The    1.5636360329510388
fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be.   She    1.67495327387791
should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly    1.5127085093302464
desirable to the child. If he can't play with Mommy's magazines,    1.6065767145351917
he should have some old numbers of his own. If Daddy's books    1.6432600607208703
are out of bounds his own picture books are not. Toys he has can be    1.7269387314284994
made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator    1.6065767145351917
and gas stove.   During this precarious period of development the    1.5636360329510388
mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience.    1.6065767145351917
She tells him of the consequences of his behavior. If he bites    1.6432600607208703
a playmate she says, "Danny won't like you". If he snatches    1.6065767145351917
a toy, she says, "Caroline wants her own truck just as you do".   1.67495327387791
There is no use trying to "Explain" to a 2-year-old. Actions    1.6065767145351917
speak louder. Remove temptations. Remove the child from the scene    1.5636360329510388
of his misbehavior. Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones    1.5127085093302464
and keep telling him how he is to act. He won't submit to his natural    1.7269387314284994
desires all the time, and it's Mother's love that is responsible    1.6065767145351917
for his good behavior.   1.0
This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities    1.6432600607208703
and colleges schedule what they call "Homecoming Day".    1.4513752902486308
They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes.   1.67495327387791
The football opponent on homecoming is, of course, selected with    1.5636360329510388
the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian    1.7026049541338664
when thrown to one of the emperor's lions. It is true, of    1.6432600607208703
course, the uncertainties of life being what they are, that as now and    1.67495327387791
then the Christian killed the lion, homecoming days have been ruined    1.6065767145351917
by a visiting team.   Even with all possible precaution, homecomings    1.5636360329510388
are usually rather cruel and sad, and only the perpetually ebullient    1.6065767145351917
and the continually optimistic are made happy by them.   More    1.5636360329510388
often than not, as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths, his    1.67495327387791
memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside    1.7269387314284994
him becomes an ache and a pain. He can smell again the perfume she    1.7026049541338664
wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter, and can smell again the    1.67495327387791
aroma of autumn- fallen leaves, the wine of cool air, and the nostalgia    1.67495327387791
of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall.    1.5636360329510388
It is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple    1.6065767145351917
of undergraduates, faces alight, holding hands and talking happily    1.5127085093302464
as they come along, oblivious of him, or throwing him the most fleeting    1.67495327387791
and casual of glances, such as they would give a tethered goat. Usually,    1.67495327387791
they titter loudly after they have passed by.   His dream    1.5636360329510388
goes. He feels, suddenly, the weight of the fat that is on him. His    1.7026049541338664
bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous. His bifocals blur.    1.6065767145351917
His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary, as if he had    1.6432600607208703
walked for miles, instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the    1.6432600607208703
old campus paths. Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is    1.67495327387791
like unripe persimmons in his mouth.   It is not much better if    1.6432600607208703
he meets with old classmates. Too often, unless he hails them, they    1.6432600607208703
pass him by. He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said, on returning    1.7269387314284994
from a homecoming reunion, that he would never go again because all    1.6432600607208703
his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him.   1.6065767145351917
If they do meet and recognize one another, slap backs and embrace,    1.6432600607208703
the moment soon is done. After all, when one has asked whatever became    1.67495327387791
of old Joe and Charlie **h when one has inquired who it was Sue    1.7026049541338664
Brown married and where it is they now live **h when questions are asked    1.7026049541338664
and answered about families and children, and old professors **h when    1.6065767145351917
the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted **h that does    1.6432600607208703
it.    1.0
By then one begins to notice the middle-age    1.4513752902486308
spread; the gray hairs, the eyeglasses, bodies that are too thin    1.6065767145351917
or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty; the athlete of by-gone    1.67495327387791
years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs    1.5127085093302464
when he has finished a sentence    1.2818970554302986
of any length **h then, it is time to break it up and move on.   1.7269387314284994
It is, if anything, worse on the old player **h   He sits    1.6432600607208703
in the stands and he doesn't like that. Enough of his life was spent    1.7026049541338664
there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator    1.7269387314284994
in the crowd. He always feels lonely. A team feels something.    1.6065767145351917
On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next    1.7850786258589375
to him. In the stands he is lonely and lost, no matter how many are about    1.748515906000203
him.   He sits there remembering the tense moment before the    1.5636360329510388
ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet, the rasp of the    1.6432600607208703
canvas pants; the smell and feel of hot, wet woolen sleeves across his    1.67495327387791
face. He remembers the desperate, panting breath; the long runs    1.5636360329510388
on the kick-offs; the hard, jolting tackles; the breakthrough; the    1.5636360329510388
desperate agony of goal-line stands. And so, he squirms with each    1.6065767145351917
play, remembering his youth.   But it is no use. It is gone.   1.6432600607208703
No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and    1.7269387314284994
strength, they can never be recaptured again.   1.3761581156320553
Since the obvious is not always true, the Republican National    1.5636360329510388
Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that    1.6065767145351917
it occurred, as suspected, in the larger cities.   Of 40 cities    1.6065767145351917
with populations of 300,000 and more, Mr& Kennedy carried 26 and Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Nixon 14. There are eight states in which the largest urban vote    1.6432600607208703
can be the balance of power in any close election. These are New    1.67495327387791
York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Illinois    1.4513752902486308
and Minnesota. In 1952 Mr& Eisenhower won all but Missouri.    1.5636360329510388
Yet, in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr& Kennedy.   1.5636360329510388
Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia. Mr& Nixon,    1.5636360329510388
despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups, failed    1.6065767145351917
to do so. His visit to Warsaw, Poland, after the Russian journey    1.6432600607208703
in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which,    1.67495327387791
in several cities, is substantial. Yet, the ~GOP breakdown discovered    1.5636360329510388
that in Philadelphia Mr& Nixon received but 21 per cent of    1.6065767145351917
the so-called "Polish" vote; 30 per cent of the "Irish" vote,    1.6065767145351917
A ~GOP "task force' committee will seek to find out how its    1.6432600607208703
party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities.   1.6432600607208703
The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican    1.6065767145351917
congressional leaders. These gentlemen already have done the party    1.5127085093302464
harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas    1.6432600607208703
and by their criticism of Mr& Kennedy for talking about a recession    1.6432600607208703
and unemployment. This error was compounded by declaring the recession    1.5636360329510388
to be "a statistical one", and not a reality. The almost six    1.6432600607208703
million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do    1.6065767145351917
not consider themselves and their plight as statistical. They did not    1.6065767145351917
view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor    1.67495327387791
Goldberg as politics, which the ~GOP declared it to be. The    1.6065767145351917
people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take    1.67495327387791
an interest in their misery.   Senator Mundt's gross distortion    1.5127085093302464
of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation    1.3761581156320553
of President Kennedy as too left wing, a statement Mr& Eisenhower    1.6065767145351917
declared to be entirely false, is another case in point. If the Republicans    1.67495327387791
and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the    1.5636360329510388
old under the Social Security program, they will thereby erect still    1.6065767145351917
another barrier to ~GOP hopes in the cities.    1.4513752902486308
The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt, Goldwater,    1.5127085093302464
Bridges, Dirksen, et al, is repeating the errors of the party    1.6065767145351917
leadership of the 1930s. In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr&    1.67495327387791
Hoover, and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the    1.6065767145351917
depression, caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican    1.6065767145351917
party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human    1.67495327387791
beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic    1.67495327387791
crash.   The Republican party was not lacking in humanity,    1.5127085093302464
but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear    1.6065767145351917
devoid of any consideration for people in trouble. Farmers called their    1.6065767145351917
mule-drawn pickup trucks "Hoover carts". Smokers reduced to    1.4513752902486308
"the makings", spoke of the sack tobacco as "Hoover dust".   1.5636360329510388
One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership    1.5127085093302464
hasn't meant to repeat this error. But it is in the process of so    1.7026049541338664
doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John    1.6065767145351917
F& Kennedy. That this is not good politics is underscored by the    1.6432600607208703
latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like    1.67495327387791
the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business.   1.6432600607208703
The most articulate Republicans are those who, in their    1.5127085093302464
desire to get back at Mr& Kennedy, already have created the image    1.6432600607208703
of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed    1.6065767145351917
and the unemployed, and which is even more unwilling to help old people    1.67495327387791
who need medical care. If they also defeat the school bill, the    1.6432600607208703
~GOP task force won't have much research to do. It will early    1.6432600607208703
know why the party won't win back city votes.   1.5127085093302464
The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider.    1.5127085093302464
The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in    1.7026049541338664
any responsible manner.   After the Griffin-Byrd political troup    1.4513752902486308
has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative    1.6432600607208703
Forum, this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature    1.6065767145351917
in history.   Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to    1.4513752902486308
Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny    1.67495327387791
as a test of his political allegiances, not his convictions.   1.5636360329510388
Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system    1.5636360329510388
stands less chance than ever. And just how far can the Legislature    1.6432600607208703
go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the    1.6432600607208703
midst of a governor's race"?   How unpartisan will be the    1.5636360329510388
recommendations    1.0
of Lt& Gov& Garland Byrd's Senate Committee    1.3761581156320553
on Government Operations?   The situation already was bad because    1.5127085093302464
the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months,    1.5636360329510388
causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.   But    1.5636360329510388
when former Gov& Marvin Griffin and Lt& Gov& Byrd accepted    1.5636360329510388
the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join    1.6065767145351917
the tour next November, the situation was aggravated.   Neither    1.5127085093302464
had a choice other than to accept the invitation. To have refused    1.6432600607208703
would have been political suicide. And it may be that one or both men    1.7026049541338664
actually welcomed the opportunity, when the bravado comments are cast    1.5636360329510388
aside.   The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard    1.5636360329510388
against the danger of eliminating potential candidates. It wanted    1.5127085093302464
the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the "serious    1.5127085093302464
candidates".   But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany    1.5127085093302464
said no, and he didn't mince any words. "They are just asking    1.6432600607208703
too much", he said. We can't think of anyone else who would want    1.67495327387791
to separate serious candidates from other candidates, either.   1.4513752902486308
There are other dangers:   Politics is an accelerating game.    1.5127085093302464
"If an opponent accuses you of lying, don't deny it. Say he is    1.67495327387791
a horse thief", runs an old adage.   These men are spenders.    1.6065767145351917
If either one ever started making promises, there is no telling where    1.6432600607208703
the promises would end. Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's    1.5636360329510388
60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths.   1.5636360329510388
The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such    1.6432600607208703
a good one. Why not have them travel the state in November debating?    1.67495327387791
It would present a forum for them in almost every community.   1.6065767145351917
But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's    1.5636360329510388
race being run in the next Legislature, the spectre of big spending    1.6432600607208703
programs, the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin.    1.6065767145351917
There isa way out of this. The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative    1.67495327387791
forum. It has arranged a campaign for governor.   If    1.5127085093302464
it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed    1.6065767145351917
next spring, and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates,    1.67495327387791
it can provide a service to the state.   But the Legislature should    1.6432600607208703
be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing    1.5636360329510388
up sides for the race.   1.1606783668269585
Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was    1.4513752902486308
not a    1.0
"great soldier". Ike's somewhat like George Washington.    1.3761581156320553
Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy.   1.67495327387791
Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire    1.4513752902486308
President Kennedy so much, they're even willing to heed his call    1.6065767145351917
to sacrifice- and give up his program.   Slogan of the John    1.6065767145351917
Birch Society: "Paddle your own canoe. The guy who makes the    1.6065767145351917
motor boats may be a Communist".   A Republican survey says    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy    1.0
won the '60 election on the religious issue. Too many people were    1.6432600607208703
afraid if the ~GOP won, they'd have to spend all their time praying.   1.67495327387791
The Providence Journal editorial (Jan& 25) entitled "East    1.4513752902486308
Greenwich Faces a Housing Development Problem" points to a    1.5127085093302464
dilemma that faces communities such as ours. Your suggested solution,    1.5636360329510388
it seems to me, is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your    1.6432600607208703
generally realistic attitude toward, and endorsement of, sound planning.   1.5127085093302464
First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already    1.6065767145351917
zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested.    1.5636360329510388
This land is in various stages of development in several locations    1.6065767145351917
throughout the town. The demand for these lots can be met for some    1.67495327387791
time to come. This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither    1.67495327387791
"to halt an influx of migrants" nor are we "setting up such standards    1.67495327387791
for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy    1.5636360329510388
land and build in the new sites".   What we are attempting to    1.6432600607208703
do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density    1.67495327387791
residential areas and industrial and commercial development. It    1.4513752902486308
is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial    1.6065767145351917
development to help pay governmental costs. Bostitch, Inc& is    1.5127085093302464
approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate    1.6065767145351917
tax. The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter,    1.6065767145351917
but this particular instance is, in my opinion, completely satisfactory.    1.5636360329510388
The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this    1.6432600607208703
property in excess of two million dollars. With our current $3 per    1.6432600607208703
hundred tax rate, it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you    1.7026049541338664
suggest a community should "try to develop a modest industrial plant"    1.6065767145351917
as the best way to meet these problems.   In order to attract    1.6432600607208703
additional industry that is compatible with this community it is    1.5636360329510388
all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly    1.6432600607208703
balance in the tax structure. As this tax base grows so then can your    1.7026049541338664
medium and low density residential areas grow. Mr& Richard Preston,    1.5636360329510388
executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and    1.5127085093302464
Development Commission, in his remarks to the Governors Conference    1.5127085093302464
on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8, 1960, warned    1.5636360329510388
against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce    1.6065767145351917
the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when    1.6432600607208703
he said: "If this is the fundamental reason for a community's    1.6065767145351917
interest or if this is the basic approach, success if any will be difficult    1.7026049541338664
to obtain". He went on to say: "In the first place, industry    1.6432600607208703
per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities.    1.67495327387791
It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased    1.6065767145351917
municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be".   1.6065767145351917
While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school    1.5127085093302464
costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer, the impact upon    1.67495327387791
a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes    1.67495327387791
to find alarm in uncontrolled growth. We in East Greenwich have the    1.6432600607208703
example of two neighboring communities, one currently utilizing double    1.5127085093302464
sessions in their schools, and the other facing this prospect next year.    1.6432600607208703
It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich    1.6432600607208703
School Committee is considering additions to at least one    1.5127085093302464
elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations    1.6065767145351917
for a school population that we know will increase. If they are to    1.67495327387791
be commended for foresight in their planning, what then is the judgment    1.6432600607208703
of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage?    1.6432600607208703
Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies    1.5636360329510388
within the community that you have called for in other editorials?    1.6065767145351917
I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not    1.67495327387791
facing the facts of life.   The "fruitful course" of metropolitanization    1.5636360329510388
that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of    1.5636360329510388
East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it    1.6432600607208703
was called. For example: _1._ The East Greenwich Police Department    1.5636360329510388
utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police    1.5127085093302464
Department, thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and    1.3761581156320553
ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East Greenwich-Potowomut    1.3761581156320553
area of the two communities. _2._ The East Greenwich    1.5127085093302464
Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich.    1.6065767145351917
_3._ The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money,    1.5636360329510388
as do other Kent County communities, for the support of the Kent    1.6432600607208703
County Memorial Hospital, a regional facility. _4._ The East    1.5127085093302464
Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of    1.5636360329510388
East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment.    1.6065767145351917
_5._ Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick,    1.6432600607208703
as reported in your newspapers, suggesting investigation of a common rubbish    1.6065767145351917
disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of    1.5636360329510388
Warwick along with East Greenwich. _6._ East Greenwich was one    1.5636360329510388
of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with    1.6432600607208703
the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we    1.5127085093302464
could not provide for ourselves. _7._ The education program for retarded    1.6065767145351917
children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils    1.5636360329510388
from at least one neighboring community.   I feel compelled    1.5127085093302464
to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community    1.67495327387791
growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town    1.6432600607208703
such as East Greenwich. I believe it is an area in which professional    1.67495327387791
planners have failed to set adequate guide posts; and yet they cannot    1.6432600607208703
ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly    1.5636360329510388
all the planning programs they have devised. These programs are    1.5636360329510388
volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must    1.7026049541338664
stand aside while land developers tell them when, where, and in what    1.6432600607208703
manner the community shall grow. We have far less to fear in the migrant    1.7026049541338664
family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions.   1.6065767145351917
Until professional planners meet this situation squarely    1.3761581156320553
and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts,    1.67495327387791
I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny.    1.67495327387791

I would like very much, on behalf of my husband and myself, to    1.67495327387791
send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the    1.6432600607208703
Gabrielle Fund.   It is indeed true, as stated in the famous    1.6065767145351917
novel of our day, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", that "no man    1.6432600607208703
is an island, entirely of itself; every man is a piece of the continent,    1.7026049541338664

the fund. It is through them that we have become aware of the divine    1.7026049541338664
humanity in man, and therefore, that most people are noble, helpful    1.6065767145351917
and good.   Bless you my friends, for it is through love and service    1.67495327387791
that brotherhood becomes a reality. @   1.1606783668269585
I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School. My future    1.6065767145351917
plans are to become a language teacher. Of course, having this desire,    1.6432600607208703
I am very interested in education.   A few weeks ago, I read    1.6432600607208703
in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston.    1.67495327387791
The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or    1.7026049541338664
over, and must not be going to high school to attend these classes.   1.67495327387791
The following week, I read in the Sunday paper that the students    1.6432600607208703
of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade.   1.6065767145351917
I wish you could see the situation as I see it. If Russian    1.67495327387791
pupils have to take these languages, how come American students have    1.6065767145351917
a choice whether or not to take a language, but have to face so many    1.7269387314284994
exceptions?   I do not think that America is like Russia,    1.5636360329510388
not in the least! I am proud of my country, the small city I live    1.7269387314284994
in, my wonderful parents, my friends and my school; but I am also    1.67495327387791
a young, able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language    1.67495327387791
but is not old enough.   Then people wonder why Russian pupils    1.6065767145351917
are more advanced than American students. Well, there lies your answer.    1.6065767145351917

At the height of the first snowstorm we had, it was impossible    1.6432600607208703
for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency.   However,    1.6065767145351917
the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my    1.6065767145351917
home in time of desperation.   Words cannot tell of the undivided    1.6065767145351917
attention and comfort their service gave to me. The concern they    1.6065767145351917
felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always    1.748515906000203
be grateful.   The rescue squad is to be praised immensely    1.5636360329510388
for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather. Had they not gotten    1.7269387314284994
me to the hospital when they did, perhaps I would not be here to    1.7026049541338664
commend them at this time.   Many thanks for a job well    1.6065767145351917
done. @   1.0
The Providence Sunday Journal article (Jan& 29) asking whether    1.5127085093302464
American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway    1.5127085093302464
to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities    1.6432600607208703
sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for    1.5127085093302464
news. Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front    1.7026049541338664
page.   On the question of admission to Veterans Administration    1.5127085093302464
hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled    1.2818970554302986
veterans, it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly    1.67495327387791
affected by war service. It can manifest itself before discharge from    1.6065767145351917
service, or it can come out years later. There is one other point    1.67495327387791
we should never lose sight of: Many veterans who enter ~VA hospitals    1.6432600607208703
as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected. No psychiatrist    1.5127085093302464
could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its    1.67495327387791
effect in the ensuing years.   The arguments advanced by those individuals    1.6065767145351917
and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically    1.6432600607208703
curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected    1.6065767145351917
case, seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with    1.5127085093302464
the wishes of the general public.   I believe in priority for    1.6065767145351917
service-connected disabled veterans in admission to ~VA hospitals.    1.4513752902486308
But I don't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected    1.6065767145351917
patients. This matter is of great importance, and the outcome may    1.6065767145351917
mean the difference between life or death, or at least serious injuries,    1.6432600607208703
for many veterans.   Some critics say that the length of stay    1.6065767145351917
in a hospital is too long. There's a reason for this length of stay.    1.7026049541338664
First of all, the admitting physician in the ~VA hospital gets    1.6065767145351917
the patient as a new patient. He has no experience with this veteran's    1.67495327387791
previous medical record. If the doctor is conscientious, he wants    1.5636360329510388
to study the patient. As a result, it takes a little longer than    1.67495327387791
it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient.   1.67495327387791
Secondly, the ~VA physician knows that when the patient    1.5127085093302464
leaves the hospital, he is no longer going to have a chance to visit    1.7026049541338664
his patient. So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects    1.7026049541338664
of treatment or surgery.   The American public must be presented    1.5636360329510388
with the facts concerning ~VA hospitalization. The public    1.4513752902486308
should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a ~VA    1.6432600607208703
hospital, the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other. The    1.7026049541338664
responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a ~VA    1.67495327387791
hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital. An    1.6432600607208703
adequate system of ~VA hospitals is better equipped to care for the    1.6432600607208703
veterans than any 50 state hospitals. @   1.2818970554302986
It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is    1.5127085093302464
once more upon us. The American Medical Association is once again    1.6065767145351917
grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the    1.6432600607208703
Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer.    1.4513752902486308
Do they, the A&M&A&, offer any solution other than outright    1.5636360329510388
abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world?   1.5636360329510388
We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand    1.6065767145351917
for medical care at ~VA hospitals will grow proportionately as age    1.6065767145351917
fosters illness. Nevertheless, we wonder at the stand of the A&M&A&    1.6065767145351917
on the health problem confronting the aged. They opposed    1.5127085093302464
the Forand bill, which would have placed the major burden of financial    1.6432600607208703
support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction;    1.5127085093302464
yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will    1.4513752902486308
cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars (matched    1.6065767145351917

_CHICAGO, AUG& 9_- In    1.0
reply to a letter in today's "voice" urging the sale of meat after    1.67495327387791
6 p& m&, I wish to state the other side of the story.   I    1.7026049541338664
am the wife of the owner of a small, independent meat market. My husband's    1.7026049541338664
hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a&    1.67495327387791
m& to 7 p& m& the early part of the week, and as late as 8 or    1.7677783654484436
9 on week-ends. Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-    1.67495327387791
and Sundays, too, for this is coming.   There is a trend to    1.6432600607208703
packaging meat at a central source, freezing it, and shipping it to outlying    1.67495327387791
stores, where meat cutters will not be required. If a customer    1.6065767145351917
wishes a special cut, it will not be available. We are slowly being    1.67495327387791
regimented to having everything packaged, whether we want it or not.   1.6065767145351917
Most women, in this age of freezers, shop for the entire week    1.6432600607208703
on week-ends, when prices are lower. Also, many working wives have children    1.6432600607208703
or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them.    1.5636360329510388
Independent market owners work six days a week; and my husband hasn't    1.6432600607208703
had a vacation in 14 years. No, we are not greedy. But if we closed    1.7269387314284994
the store for a vacation, we would lose our customers to the chain    1.67495327387791
stores in the next block.   The meat cutters' union, which has    1.6065767145351917
a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area,    1.7026049541338664

the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the    1.6065767145351917
American flag. Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of    1.6065767145351917
election commissioners are instructed to do this.   The resolution    1.5127085093302464
further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment    1.5127085093302464
to their premises for the display of the flag.   It was my desire    1.67495327387791
to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling    1.6432600607208703
places are on private property and, without an amendment to the law,    1.6432600607208703
we could not enforce this. My discussion with reference to the resolution    1.6432600607208703
was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of    1.6432600607208703

the position of Attorney General Robert F& Kennedy on prospective    1.5636360329510388
tax relief for du Pont stockholders is based on an erroneous    1.6065767145351917
statement of fact. As a result, your criticism of Attorney General    1.6065767145351917
Robert F& Kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate,    1.5636360329510388
unwarranted and unfair.   The editorial concerned legislative proposals    1.4513752902486308
to ease the tax burden on du Pont stockholders, in connection    1.6065767145351917
with the United States Supreme court ruling that du Pont must divest    1.6432600607208703
itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings. These proposals    1.5636360329510388
would reduce the amount of tax that du Pont stockholders might    1.6065767145351917
have to pay- from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present    1.6065767145351917
law to as little as 192 million dollars.   Congressman Wilbur D&    1.6065767145351917
Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, asked    1.5636360329510388
the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals    1.6065767145351917
as they related to anti-trust law enforcement. The attorney general    1.5636360329510388
responded by letter dated July 19. Copies of this letter were made    1.6432600607208703
avaliable to the press and public.   In this letter, Mr& Kennedy    1.6065767145351917
made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration-    1.6432600607208703
what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust    1.5636360329510388
judgments. There are a number of other considerations besides    1.5127085093302464
this one but it is for the Congress, not the department of justice,    1.67495327387791
to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.   1.6065767145351917
Yet your editorial said: "Now the attorney general    1.4513752902486308
writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of revenue of this    1.6065767145351917
proportion'". What Mr& Kennedy, in fact, wrote was: "It    1.5127085093302464
is the department's view that no <anti-trust enforcement> considerations    1.5127085093302464

_DOWNERS GROVE, AUG& 8_- A recent news story    1.4513752902486308
reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane    1.5636360329510388
passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks.   1.5636360329510388
They do our country great harm by such actions. Those in the public    1.67495327387791
eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad.   1.5636360329510388

_PROVIDENCE,    1.0
AUG& 5_- Overt socialism means government ownership and management    1.5127085093302464
of a nation's main industries. In covert socialism- toward    1.5127085093302464
which America is moving- private enterprise retains the ownership    1.5127085093302464
title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive    1.5636360329510388
regulations actually controls them.   In order to attract    1.4513752902486308
new industries, 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build    1.67495327387791
government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise. This    1.5636360329510388
is a step toward overt socialism.   Issuing bonds for plant construction    1.6065767145351917
has brought new industries to certain regions.    1.3761581156320553
_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- We are    1.2818970554302986
writing in reference to a recent "suggestion" made to the staff    1.6065767145351917
of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City (registered    1.5636360329510388
professional nurses with college background and varying experiences).    1.4513752902486308
The day before Election Day, to which we are entitled as a legal holiday,    1.7026049541338664
we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as "workers    1.67495327387791
of the party".   Being ethical and professional people    1.4513752902486308
interested in community health and well-being, we felt this wasn't    1.5636360329510388
a function of our position. Such tactics reek of totalitarianism!    1.5636360329510388
As we understand, this directive was given to all city and county employes.   1.67495327387791
To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed    1.6065767145351917
because of political affiliation. We, therefore, considered the "suggestion"    1.5127085093302464
an insult to our intelligence, ethics, Bill of Rights,    1.5127085093302464
etc&. Our only obligation for this day is to vote, free of persuasion,    1.67495327387791
for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.   1.6065767145351917
This is our duty- not as nurses or city employes- but as citizens    1.67495327387791
_TO THE    1.0
EDITOR:_ Sir- I read of a man who felt he should not build    1.67495327387791
a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to    1.7026049541338664
sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters. Does this man live in    1.67495327387791
a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves,    1.6065767145351917
but ready to demand that "the community" help and protect them?   1.6065767145351917
Community shelters are, of course, necessary for those    1.4513752902486308
having    1.0
no space for shelter. If in a town of 2,000 private homes, half of    1.7026049541338664
them have shelters, the need for the community shelters will be reduced    1.6432600607208703
to that extent.   In designing his home fallout shelter there    1.5636360329510388
is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants,    1.67495327387791
"plus-one"- so he will be able to take in a stranger. I    1.6432600607208703
hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes    1.7026049541338664
will have a change of heart, will get busy and be the first member of    1.7269387314284994

_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- When    1.1606783668269585
the colonies decided upon freedom from England, we insisted, through    1.5636360329510388
the Declaration of Independence, that the nations of the world recognize    1.6065767145351917
us as a separate political entity. It is high time the United    1.6432600607208703
States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set forth    1.6432600607208703
in that document are applicable today to Katanga.   In the United    1.6065767145351917
Nations Charter, the right of self-determination is also an essential    1.5636360329510388
principle. This, again, applies to Katanga. The people of Katanga    1.5636360329510388
had fought for, and obtained, their freedom from the Communist    1.5636360329510388
yoke of Antoine Gizenga, and his cohorts. By political, economic, geographic    1.6065767145351917
and natural standards, they were justified in doing so.   1.5127085093302464
The United States and the U&N& denounce their own principles    1.5636360329510388
when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge    1.5636360329510388
the right of self-determination of the Katangans. @    1.3761581156320553
_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Permit me to commend    1.4513752902486308
your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county    1.67495327387791
colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers    1.5636360329510388
have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit    1.7026049541338664
them to.   The bill which passed the Assembly last May and    1.6065767145351917
is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny. The procedure    1.67495327387791
for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges    1.6432600607208703
and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.   1.5127085093302464
Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county    1.67495327387791
college will be appointed; none will be elected. The trustees    1.5636360329510388
will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board    1.7026049541338664
of school estimate. This board will consist of two of the trustees    1.6432600607208703
of the college, and the director and two members of the board of freeholders.    1.7026049541338664
It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college    1.67495327387791
and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders, which "shall    1.6432600607208703
appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made    1.5636360329510388
by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed, levied    1.67495327387791
and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes".   1.6432600607208703
The approval of only three members of the board of    1.5636360329510388
school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted    1.67495327387791
to the college. Since two of these could be trustees of the college,    1.67495327387791
actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected    1.67495327387791
official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue.    1.6432600607208703
This is taxation without representation. @    1.1606783668269585
_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Your editorial,    1.2818970554302986
"Housing Speedup", is certainly not the answer to our slum problems.    1.6065767145351917
The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary    1.6065767145351917
case of slum conditions.   Change our taxing law so that no tax    1.6432600607208703
shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.    1.67495327387791
Then see what a boom in all trades, as well as slum clearance    1.67495327387791
at no cost to taxpayers, will happen. Our entire economy will have    1.6432600607208703

heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New York,    1.7269387314284994
it is listed as "death due to natural causes". @    1.5127085093302464
_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Every resident of this city    1.5127085093302464

Skyline in Newark". It will be at the museum until March 30.   1.6432600607208703
It is a revelation of what has been done, what is being done    1.67495327387791
and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects' plans, models    1.67495327387791
and pictures. It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and    1.6432600607208703
certainly make every Newarker proud of this city.   It should    1.5636360329510388
also make him desire to participate actively in civic, school and religious    1.6432600607208703
life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live    1.6432600607208703

_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- I hasten to join in praise of the    1.6432600607208703
men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway. Recently I traveled    1.67495327387791
the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most    1.67495327387791
courteous group of men you will find anywhere. One even gave my little    1.67495327387791
dog a biscuit. It was very refreshing. @    1.3761581156320553
The viewers of the "deep Peep Show"    1.3761581156320553
at 15th and ~M streets nw& have an added attraction- the view    1.6432600607208703
of a fossilized cypress swamp. Twenty feet below the street level    1.6065767145351917
in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site, a black    1.7269387314284994
coal-like deposit has been encountered.   This is a black swamp    1.5636360329510388
clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees    1.6065767145351917
were growing. The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found    1.6432600607208703
embedded in the clay. Some of the stumps are as much as three feet    1.7026049541338664
long, but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying    1.7026049541338664
sediments. Although the wood has been changed to coal, much    1.5636360329510388
of it still retains its original cell structure.   In the clay are    1.6432600607208703
entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants    1.6065767145351917
growing in the region at the time. These microfossils indicate the    1.6065767145351917
swamp was "formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs    1.5636360329510388
were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing.   1.67495327387791
The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with    1.5636360329510388
the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported    1.6065767145351917
in <The Washington Post>, August 2, 1955, which was probably    1.5636360329510388
formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.    1.6065767145351917

Recently the secretary of the Friends    1.2818970554302986
Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air.    1.5127085093302464
While I respect his sincere concern for peace, he made four points    1.6432600607208703
that I would like to question. _1._ He said, "Let's work for    1.6432600607208703
peace instead of protection from aggression". I would ask, "Why    1.5636360329510388
not do both"? Military power does not cause war; war is the result    1.67495327387791
of mistrust and lack of understanding between people. Are we not    1.6065767145351917
late, especially those of us who call ourselves Friends, in doing enough    1.6432600607208703
about this lack of understanding? _2._ As to protection,    1.5127085093302464
the speaker disapproved of shelters, pointing out that fallout shelters    1.5636360329510388
would not save everyone. Is this a reason for saving no one? Would    1.67495327387791
the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his    1.7026049541338664
boat could not pick up everyone? _3._ The speaker suggested    1.5636360329510388
that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face.    1.67495327387791
If the world comes to this, wouldn't it be the very time when courage    1.7026049541338664
and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild?    1.5636360329510388
Many of our young people think it would. _4._ Lastly, the speaker    1.6432600607208703
decried our organized program of emergency help calling it "Civilian    1.5636360329510388
Defense". In 1950, Public Law 920 created Civil Defense    1.5127085093302464
(different from Civilian-groups of World War /2,), a responsibility    1.5127085093302464
of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property    1.7026049541338664
in disaster, natural or manmade.   Far from creating fear,    1.5127085093302464
as the speaker suggests, preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency-    1.6432600607208703
gives people confidence. Civil Defense has far to go and    1.5636360329510388
many problems to solve, but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer    1.7269387314284994
tradition to be not only willing, but prepared to care for our own families    1.7026049541338664
and help our neighbors in any disaster- storm, flood, accident    1.5636360329510388
or even war? @    1.0
It seems rather peculiar    1.0
that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves    1.6065767145351917
with the protection and companionship of dogs. I feel that few    1.6065767145351917
burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment    1.6065767145351917
if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide. In    1.7269387314284994
addition, would not the young female public of Washington be afforded    1.6065767145351917
a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets    1.67495327387791
if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?   I grant that    1.67495327387791
the dog may not be really protective, based on his training, but if you    1.7026049541338664
were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady    1.7026049541338664
to molest, how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with    1.67495327387791
a dog? I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners    1.6432600607208703
get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting    1.5127085093302464
dogs in apartments. @    1.0
Use the terraces of the    1.1606783668269585
Capitol for a sidewalk cafe? Could Senator Humphrey be serious    1.5636360329510388
in his proposal? Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'    1.67495327387791
comfort?   Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could    1.4513752902486308
be extended. The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak.    1.5636360329510388
Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel    1.7269387314284994
too far to eat? Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money    1.6432600607208703
to support themselves during the off season. As an added suggestion    1.6065767145351917
to balance the budget, the Government could sell advertising space    1.5636360329510388

For the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large,    1.7026049541338664
powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional    1.5636360329510388
warfare of the past a nullity. The United States and Soviet    1.6065767145351917
Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations. Recent    1.5636360329510388
statements    1.0
by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power    1.3761581156320553
of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient    1.6432600607208703
to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead    1.6065767145351917
of negotiations.   President Kennedy was right when he said, "We    1.5636360329510388
shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate".    1.67495327387791
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and    1.6065767145351917
the Far East. It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe    1.67495327387791
are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war. The    1.5636360329510388
fact is that the Italians, French and British know that they have    1.6432600607208703
no defense against nuclear bombs. We have no right to criticize them,    1.6432600607208703
as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.    1.6432600607208703
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access    1.6432600607208703
into Berlin. It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to    1.6432600607208703
prevent us. But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from    1.7026049541338664
granting de facto recognition to East Germany. Soviet Russia has    1.5636360329510388
been invaded twice by German troops in a generation. In the last war    1.67495327387791
Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories    1.6432600607208703
were devastated. _PROBABLE AGREEMENT_ The truth is that Communist    1.5127085093302464
Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism. Berlin is merely    1.5636360329510388
being used by Moscow as a stalking horse. Actually, the    1.5636360329510388
Communists,    1.0
out of fear of a united and armed Germany, would probably be willing    1.67495327387791
to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral    1.6432600607208703
and have its independence guaranteed by the U& N&.   If    1.5636360329510388
the Communists are sincere in wanting a united, neutral and disarmed    1.6065767145351917
Germany, it might well be advantageous for the German people in this    1.6432600607208703
nuclear age. It could provide security without cost of armaments and    1.6065767145351917
increase German prosperity and lessen taxation. France and other Western    1.5636360329510388
European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany. If the German    1.5636360329510388
people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following    1.6065767145351917
the example of Austria.   President Kennedy has urged a    1.5127085093302464
peace race on disarmament that might be called "Operation Survival"    1.5636360329510388
which has many facets. Why not make a beginning with a united and    1.67495327387791
disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing    1.5127085093302464
would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States?    1.6432600607208703
A united Germany, freed of militarism, might be the first step toward    1.6432600607208703
disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world. @    1.5127085093302464
_TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK    1.3761581156320553
TIMES:_ In your editorial of Sept& 30 "The Smoldering Congo"    1.5636360329510388
you make the following comment: "Far too many states are following    1.6065767145351917
the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments. It    1.5636360329510388
is up to the Assembly to take action against them. They are violating    1.67495327387791
their Charter obligation, the prescribed penalty for which is suspension    1.5636360329510388
of membership or expulsion".   I would like to quote from    1.5636360329510388
the Charter of the United Nations:   "Article 17, Section    1.5127085093302464
1: The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget    1.5636360329510388
of the Organization.   "Section 2: The expenses of the    1.5127085093302464
Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General    1.6432600607208703
Assembly.   "Article 19: A Member of the United Nations    1.5127085093302464
which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions    1.6065767145351917
to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if    1.6432600607208703
the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions    1.67495327387791
due from it for the preceding two full years".   The U&    1.6065767145351917
S& S& R& and her followers are careful in paying their obligations    1.6432600607208703
to the regular budget. But they refuse, as do the Arab states,    1.6432600607208703
to support the United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United    1.5636360329510388
Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between    1.6065767145351917
Egypt and Israel, and the U& N& troops in the Congo, which    1.6432600607208703
expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations,    1.6432600607208703
but by a special budget.   According to the official interpretation    1.5636360329510388
of the Charter, a member cannot be penalized by not having the    1.6432600607208703
right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial    1.6065767145351917
obligations to the "special" United Nations' budgets, and of    1.5127085093302464
course cannot be expelled from the Organization (which you suggested    1.5636360329510388
in your editorial), due to the fact that there is no provision in the    1.7026049541338664
Charter for expulsion. @    1.0

AMENDMENT'S REPEAL HELD STEP TOWARD WORLD ORDER_ @ _TO THE    1.5127085093302464
EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ In your Sept& 27 editorial appraisal    1.6432600607208703
of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress    1.6065767145351917
you referred to the lack of "consciousness of destiny in a time    1.6432600607208703
of acute national and world peril". Yet your list of things left    1.6432600607208703
undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's    1.6432600607208703
domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute    1.5127085093302464
of the International Court of Justice.   The Connally    1.4513752902486308
amendment says that the United States, rather than the court, shall    1.6065767145351917
determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction    1.5636360329510388
of the United States in a case before the World Court to which    1.67495327387791
the United States is a party. If the case is thus determined by us    1.7026049541338664
to be domestic, the court has no jurisdiction.   Since the Connally    1.6065767145351917
amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other    1.6432600607208703
party to a dispute with the United States, it also prevents us from    1.67495327387791
using the court effectively. Yet although the Kennedy Administration,    1.5127085093302464
and the Eisenhower Administration before it, have both declared themselves    1.5636360329510388
solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment, as contrary to    1.5636360329510388
our best interests, no action has yet been taken.   Our "destiny"    1.6065767145351917
in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit    1.6432600607208703
of peace, with justice, under law. To achieve this destiny, acts    1.6065767145351917
as well as words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical strength    1.7026049541338664
but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.   1.67495327387791
What better affirmative step could be taken to this end    1.5636360329510388
than repeal of the Connally amendment- an act which could expose    1.6065767145351917
the    1.0
United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging    1.7026049541338664
attitude toward the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance    1.6065767145351917
in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?   1.6065767145351917
We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the    1.7026049541338664
Eighty-seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate    1.5127085093302464
of the Connally amendment. @    1.0

utilizing the Flushing-Main Street express are daily confronted with    1.5127085093302464
the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their    1.6432600607208703
express comes to a stop, leaving them stranded and strained. To the    1.6432600607208703
tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth Street    1.6065767145351917

The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation    1.4513752902486308
"hold" lights at ~BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Street    1.4513752902486308
stations in Brooklyn. This "holds" the local until the express    1.5636360329510388
passengers change trains. Without question, this time and temper saver    1.5636360329510388

As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly, from three    1.67495327387791
to four hours a day.   In the last few years the telephone company    1.67495327387791
has managed to automate many areas of their service. It has not    1.6432600607208703
been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization    1.7026049541338664
which has brought about new ways of dialing.   However, there    1.5636360329510388
are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone    1.6432600607208703
operators. I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the    1.6065767145351917
young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls, special long-distance    1.5127085093302464
calls, etc&. Either it is lack of training, lack of proper    1.6065767145351917
screening when hiring, lack of management or possibly lack of interest    1.6065767145351917
on the part of the telephone company, which does have a Government-blessed    1.6432600607208703
monopoly.    1.0

American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do    1.6432600607208703
what they can to bring in dollars for its support.   There are    1.6432600607208703

departments such as welfare, ~DPW and sanitation. Negligence in    1.5127085093302464
garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.   He    1.5636360329510388
should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at    1.6432600607208703

Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy    1.6432600607208703

especially children, were encouraged to be polite? Why has    1.5127085093302464
this form of gentility gone out of American life?   How can    1.6065767145351917
we old-fashioned parents, who still feel that adults are due some respect    1.6432600607208703
from children, battle the new type of advertising that appears on    1.6065767145351917
~TV without denying the children the use of television entirely?    1.5636360329510388
Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of "modern"    1.6432600607208703
parents they have observed. From necessity, they are also inspired    1.5636360329510388
by the "hard-sell" attitude of the sponsor, so, finally, it    1.5636360329510388

is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it.   1.6432600607208703
As I see it, if war starts and we survive the initial attack    1.67495327387791
enough to be able to fight back, the nuclear weapons we now have-    1.67495327387791

award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold    1.6432600607208703
strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation. Had    1.6065767145351917
it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations    1.6065767145351917
was living, unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in    1.5636360329510388
pursuing a difficult and, in many ways, thankless task.   According    1.5636360329510388
to one report, however, Mr& Hammarskjold was considered "too    1.5127085093302464
controversial" a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last    1.6065767145351917
spring. Actually, of course, that label "controversial" applied    1.4513752902486308
only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world    1.67495327387791
organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet    1.6065767145351917
Union.   At Khrushchev's door, therefore, can be placed    1.4513752902486308
the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves    1.6432600607208703
to be intimidated. It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a    1.7269387314284994
coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.    1.67495327387791
As has happened so often in the past, the ability to recognize    1.6432600607208703
_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just a brief note of    1.6065767145351917
appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver    1.5127085093302464
Bashir Ahmad for providing a first-class example of "people to people"    1.6065767145351917
good will. If only this could be done more often- with such    1.6432600607208703
heartening results- many of the earth's "big problems" would    1.5127085093302464
shrink to the insignificances they really are.   P& S&. Thanks    1.5636360329510388
for your good coverage of Ahmad's visit, too! @    1.4513752902486308
_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_    1.2818970554302986
Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway    1.3761581156320553
are valuable; however, several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.   1.4513752902486308
One of the problems associated with the expressway    1.4513752902486308
stems from the basic idea. We shuffle a large percentage of the cars    1.67495327387791
across the river twice. They start on the East side of the Schuylkill,    1.67495327387791
have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over    1.7026049541338664
again to the East at their destination. Bridges, tunnels and ferries    1.6065767145351917
are the most common methods of river crossings. Each one of these    1.6432600607208703
is, by its nature, a focal point or a point of natural congestion. We    1.7026049541338664
should avoid these congestion points or, putting it another way, keep    1.6065767145351917
cars starting and ending on the East side of the river- on the East    1.7026049541338664
side.   This can be accomplished by several logical steps:    1.5127085093302464
_(1)_ Widen the East River Drive at least one lane. _(2)_    1.6065767145351917
So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage    1.6432600607208703
problems. _(3)_ Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead    1.5127085093302464
directional lights as on our bridges. One additional lane would then    1.6065767145351917
be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the    1.5636360329510388
traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent.    1.6065767145351917
_(4)_ This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures    1.5127085093302464
necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying    1.4513752902486308
the natural beauty of the East River Drive. @    1.4513752902486308
_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ I wish    1.4513752902486308
to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square: _1._ Take    1.5636360329510388
away George Washington's statue. _2._ Replace it with the    1.5127085093302464
statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators.   There's    1.6065767145351917
no sense in being reminded of times that were. Washington Square seems    1.6432600607208703
not part of a free land. It may remind one of Russia, China or    1.7026049541338664
East Berlin; but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington    1.6432600607208703
and the Continental soldiers fought for.   The Fairmount    1.4513752902486308
Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals, because it    1.6065767145351917
is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square.    1.6065767145351917
The matter may seem a small thing to some people, I know, but it's    1.7026049541338664
a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism **h The Commission    1.6432600607208703
has posted signs in Washington Square saying:   {The    1.4513752902486308
Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This Square.}   <Fairmount    1.5127085093302464
Park Commission>   Does each tentacle of the octopus of    1.5127085093302464
City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers    1.6432600607208703
an annoyance? If birds don't belong in a Square or Park, what    1.6432600607208703
does? They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of Nature.    1.67495327387791
The trees are their homes; but the Commission does not share    1.6065767145351917
such sentiments.   The whole official City apparently has an    1.5127085093302464
intense hatred toward birds. Starlings and blackbirds are scared off    1.5636360329510388
by cannon, from City Hall. Just a preliminary measure. If any are    1.6432600607208703
left, presently, we may expect to see signs specifically {PROHIBITING}    1.5636360329510388
the feeding of them too.   The City Government is not    1.5636360329510388
united in an all-out, to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs, delinquents,    1.6065767145351917
thugs, murderers, rapists, subversives. Indeed no. Let every    1.4513752902486308
policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe, lest one    1.7026049541338664
piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.   Of    1.6065767145351917
course, in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and    1.7026049541338664
innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them    1.6065767145351917
and afraid to protest and say "How come? What's your motive?    1.6065767145351917
{WHO} wants this deed done"?- in this small way do    1.5636360329510388
the leaders of a city, or of a nation, iniure the masses to watching,    1.7026049541338664
or even inflicting, torture and death, upon even their fellow men.   1.6065767145351917
One means to help the birds occurs to me: Let the chimes that    1.67495327387791
ring over Washington Square twice daily, discontinue any piece of music    1.6065767145351917
but one. Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody    1.6432600607208703
has been the joy of mankind since time began, the hymn "Abide With    1.67495327387791
Me". We will know, and He will know, to whom it is rendered, what    1.7026049541338664
the birds would ask: @ @    1.0

THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ There is a trend today to bemoan    1.6432600607208703
the fact that Americans are too "soft". Unfortunately, those who    1.5636360329510388
would remedy our "softness" seek to do so with calisthenics. They    1.6065767145351917
are working on the wrong part of our anatomy. It is not our bodies    1.7026049541338664
but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft. Ashamed of our wealth    1.7026049541338664
and power, afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace,    1.6065767145351917
we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.   1.5636360329510388
When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which    1.6065767145351917
we know to be right, when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations    1.7269387314284994
which do not permit self-determination, when we become strong enough    1.5636360329510388
to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation, when    1.6432600607208703
we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war, and when we realize    1.67495327387791
that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom, then,    1.6065767145351917
and only then will we no longer be "soft". America doesn't need    1.6432600607208703
to "push-up", she needs to stand up! @    1.3761581156320553
_TO THE EDITOR:_    1.0
The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals, is    1.5636360329510388
fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has    1.67495327387791
some merit. However, he states unequivocally "the scandals in business    1.5636360329510388
are far less significant than the scandals in labor". I must,    1.6065767145351917
in fairness, take issue with his premise, primarily because the so-called    1.6065767145351917
scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals.   1.6065767145351917
The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan    1.5127085093302464
hearings had to do with "sweetheart contracts". These arrangements    1.5127085093302464
would have been impossible if the business community was truly    1.5636360329510388
interested in the welfare of its employes. A sweetheart arrangement    1.5636360329510388
can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous    1.67495327387791
labor leaders demanding tribute. Anyone familiar with the details    1.5127085093302464
of the McClellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart    1.6065767145351917
arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented    1.5127085093302464
the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.   Further, it    1.5127085093302464
should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress    1.6432600607208703
to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the    1.6432600607208703
Landrum-Griffin Act.    1.0
The nuclear war is already being fought,    1.3761581156320553
except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not yet.    1.67495327387791
It is being fought, moreover, in fairly close correspondence with    1.5636360329510388
the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories. They predicted    1.6065767145351917
escalation, and escalation is what we are getting. The biggest nuclear    1.6065767145351917
device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons,    1.5636360329510388
although our ~B-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs    1.6065767145351917
apiece. Some time ago, however, Mr& Khrushchev decided that when    1.5636360329510388
bigger bombs were made, the Soviet Union would make them. He seems    1.6432600607208703
to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand, since we cannot    1.7269387314284994
assume that he has exploded his entire stock. And now, of course,    1.6432600607208703
the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side.    1.6432600607208703
Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb? So be it- then    1.6065767145351917
we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common    1.67495327387791
or hydrogen variety, and neutron bombs, which do not exist but are said    1.67495327387791
to be the coming thing. So escalation proceeds, ad infinitum or, more    1.6432600607208703
accurately, until the contestants begin dropping them on each other    1.5636360329510388
instead of on their respective proving grounds.   What is needed,    1.5636360329510388
Philip Morrison writes in <The Cornell Daily Sun> (October    1.5127085093302464
26) is a discontinuity. The escalation must end sometime, and probably    1.6065767145351917
quite soon. "Only a discontinuity can end it", Professor Morrison    1.5636360329510388
writes. "The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction,    1.6065767145351917
or that of diplomatic policy".   Morrison points out    1.4513752902486308
that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red    1.67495327387791
China, it is the most vulnerable of the great powers- Europe of    1.6432600607208703
course must be written off out of hand. He feels, therefore, that to    1.67495327387791
seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the    1.67495327387791
least risky path our government can take. His proposal is opposed to    1.6432600607208703
that of Richard Nixon, Governor Rockefeller, past chairmen Strauss    1.5127085093302464
and McCone of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr& Edward Teller    1.5636360329510388
and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation    1.6432600607208703
of the cold war. These gentlemen are calling for a resumption    1.6065767145351917
of testing- in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale, all    1.6065767145351917
in the name of national security. Escalation is their first love and    1.6432600607208703
their last; they will be faithful unto death.   Capable as their    1.6065767145351917
minds may be in some directions, these guardians of the nation's    1.6065767145351917
security are incapable of learning, or even of observing. If this capacity    1.6432600607208703
had not failed them, they would see that their enemy has made a    1.67495327387791
disastrous miscalculation. He has gained only one thing- he has exploded    1.6065767145351917
a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust    1.6065767145351917
to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges. But if his    1.6065767145351917
purpose was to inspire terror, his action could hardly have miscarried    1.6065767145351917
more obviously. Not terror, but anger and resentment have been the    1.6065767145351917
general    1.0
reaction outside the Soviet sphere.   Khrushchev himself is    1.4513752902486308
reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused, yet    1.67495327387791
our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his    1.6065767145351917
footsteps. When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success    1.5636360329510388
of another, it is only natural. Thus, when the Russians sent up their    1.67495327387791
first sputnik, American chagrin was human enough, and American determination    1.5636360329510388
to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable.    1.5127085093302464
But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of    1.6432600607208703
his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly.    1.5636360329510388
When East Germans fled to the West by the thousands, paeans of    1.6432600607208703
joy rose from the throats of Western publicists. They are less vocal    1.6432600607208703
now, when it is the West Berliners who are migrating. The flood    1.6432600607208703
is not as great- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative    1.67495327387791
account- but it is symptomatic. West Berlin morale is low and,    1.6065767145351917
in age distribution, the situation is unfavorable. Nearly 18 per cent    1.6065767145351917
of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older,    1.5127085093302464
only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen.   R& H& S& Crossman,    1.6065767145351917
M&P&, writing in <The Manchester Guardian>, states that    1.4513752902486308
departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700,    1.67495327387791
but of 1,700 a week, and applications to leave have risen to 1,900 a    1.7026049541338664
week. The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers    1.6432600607208703
or independent professional people. Whole families are moving and    1.5127085093302464
removal firms are booked for months ahead. The weekly loss is partly    1.6432600607208703
counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany, but the    1.6065767145351917
hard truth, says Crossman, is that "The closing off of East Berlin    1.6432600607208703
without interference from the West and with the use only of East    1.6432600607208703
German, as distinct from Russian, troops was a major Communist victory,    1.6065767145351917
which dealt West Berlin a deadly, possibly a fatal, blow. The    1.6065767145351917
gallant half-city is dying on its feet".   Another piece of    1.5636360329510388
evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in the <Observer> (London).    1.6065767145351917
Mark Arnold-Foster writes: "People are leaving [West Berlin]    1.4513752902486308
because they think it is dying. They are leaving so fast that    1.6432600607208703
the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an    1.5636360329510388
appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six    1.67495327387791
months' front-line work in factories in West Berlin. Berlin's    1.5127085093302464
resilience is amazing, but if it has to hire its labor in the West the    1.7269387314284994
struggle will be hard indeed".   The handwriting is on the wall.    1.6065767145351917
The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will    1.6432600607208703
bring down the wall and reunite the city. State Department officials    1.6065767145351917
refusing to show their passes at the boundary, and driving two blocks    1.6432600607208703
into East Berlin under military escort, will not avail. Tanks lined    1.6065767145351917
up at the border will be no more helpful. The materials for compromise    1.67495327387791
are at hand: <The Nation>, Walter Lippmann and other sober    1.5636360329510388
commentators (see Alan Clark on p& 367) have spelled them out again    1.6432600607208703
and again. A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of    1.6432600607208703
triumph, but it will save Berlin. Or the city can be a graveyard monument    1.7026049541338664
to Western intransigence, if that is what the West wants.    1.5636360329510388
The removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared    1.5636360329510388
with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not    1.6432600607208703
unprecedented in history. It is, in fact, a relatively mild chastisement    1.6065767145351917
of the dead. A British writer, Richard Haestier, in a book,    1.6065767145351917
<Dead Men Tell Tales>, recalls that in the turmoil preceding    1.5636360329510388
the French Revolution the body of Henry /4,, who had died nearly    1.6432600607208703
180 years earlier, was torn to pieces by a mob. And in England, after    1.7026049541338664
the Restoration, the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at    1.6065767145351917
Tyburn. The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster, and the    1.67495327387791
rest of the body was buried under the gallows.   Contemplating    1.5636360329510388
these posthumous punishments, Stalin should not lose all hope. In 1899,    1.6065767145351917
Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster, facing    1.5127085093302464
Whitehall and there, presumably, he still stands. Nikita Khrushchev,    1.5127085093302464
however, has created yet another problem for himself. The Lenin tomb    1.6065767145351917
is obviously adequate for double occupancy, Moscow is a crowded city,    1.6065767145351917
and the creed of communism deplores waste. Who will take Stalin's    1.6065767145351917
place beside Lenin? There is Karl Marx, of course, buried in    1.6065767145351917
London.    1.0
The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go, but he has    1.67495327387791
been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could    1.5636360329510388
not make him look presentable. Who, then, is of sufficient stature to    1.6432600607208703
lodge with Lenin? Who but Nikita himself? Since he has just    1.6065767145351917
shown who is top dog, he may not be ready to receive this highest honor    1.7269387314284994
in the gift of the Soviet people. Besides, he can hardly avoid musing    1.67495327387791
on the instability of death which, what with exhumations and rehabilitations,    1.6065767145351917
seems to match that of life. Suppose he did lie beside Lenin,    1.6432600607208703
would it be permanent? If some future Khrushchev decided to    1.5636360329510388
rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor, would not the factory    1.6432600607208703
workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession? When    1.5127085093302464
a man is laid to rest, he is entitled to stay put. If Nikita buys    1.7269387314284994
a small plot in some modest rural cemetery, everyone will understand.    1.6065767145351917
The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the    1.5127085093302464
U&N&'s Acting Secretary General- at this writing, the choice    1.5127085093302464
appears to be certain- offers further proof that in politics    1.5636360329510388
it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential    1.67495327387791
friends. Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland    1.5636360329510388
were early    1.0
favorites in the running, but France didn't like the    1.5127085093302464
former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter. With the    1.67495327387791
neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed    1.5636360329510388
Mr&    1.0
Hammarskjold, U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely    1.5636360329510388
to be waylaid by a veto. What is interesting is that his positive    1.67495327387791
qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to    1.67495327387791
his candidacy. In all the bitter in-fighting, the squabbles over election    1.6065767145351917
procedures, the complicated numbers game that East and West played    1.5636360329510388
on the assistant secretaries' theme, the gentleman from Burma showed    1.5636360329510388
himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat. He has,    1.67495327387791
moreover, another qualification which augurs well for the future.    1.5127085093302464
He is a Buddhist, which means that to him peace and the sanctity of    1.7026049541338664
human life are not only religious dogma, but a profound and unshakable    1.6432600607208703
<Weltanschauung>.   U Thant of course, will hold office until    1.5127085093302464
the spring of 1963, when Mr& Hammarskjold's term would have come    1.6065767145351917
to an end. Whether the compromises- on both sides- that made    1.6065767145351917
possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen.    1.6432600607208703
Mr& Khrushchev's demand for a <troika> is dormant, not dead;    1.5636360329510388
the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism    1.6432600607208703
that U Thant represents. In a sense, the showdown promised by Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided; no precedents    1.5636360329510388
have been set as yet; structurally, the U&N& is still    1.5636360329510388
fluid, vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership    1.6065767145351917
are bringing to bear upon it. But at least the pessimists who believed    1.67495327387791
that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane    1.6432600607208703
crash in the Congo have been proved wrong.    1.4513752902486308
No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are    1.67495327387791
their sole staple in trade. These are mentalities which crave action-    1.6065767145351917
and they are beginning to get it, as Messrs& Salsich and Engh    1.6432600607208703
report on page 372. Even in areas where political connotations are    1.6065767145351917
(deliberately?) left vague, the spirit of vigilantism is spreading.    1.5127085093302464
<Friends>, a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers, describes    1.5127085093302464
a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone    1.5127085093302464
Company at Foley, Alabama. "If the day should ever come that    1.6065767145351917
foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast", the account reads,    1.6065767145351917
"they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained    1.6065767145351917
telephone employees- all girls. **h Heavily armed and mobilized    1.5127085093302464
as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit, 23 operators and office    1.5636360329510388
personnel **h stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice".    1.6432600607208703
According to <Friends>, the unit was organized by John Snook,    1.5636360329510388
a former World War /2, commando who is vice president and general    1.6432600607208703
manager of the telephone company. The girls, very fetching in their    1.6065767145351917
uniforms, are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;    1.67495327387791
they are also trained with carbines, automatic weapons, pistols,    1.5127085093302464
rifles and other such ladies' accessories.   This may be <opera    1.5636360329510388
bouffe> now, but it will become more serious should the cold war    1.6432600607208703
mount in frenzy. The country is committed to the doctrine of security    1.6432600607208703
by military means. The doctrine has never worked; it is not working    1.6432600607208703
now. The official military establishment can only threaten to use    1.5636360329510388
its nuclear arms; it cannot bring them into actual play. A more dangerous    1.67495327387791
formula for national frustration cannot be imagined. As the civic    1.5636360329510388
temper rises, the more naive citizens begin to play soldier- but    1.6065767145351917
the guns are real. Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they    1.7026049541338664
are assured are in our midst.    1.2818970554302986
All false gods resemble Moloch, at least in the early phases of their    1.67495327387791
careers, so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship    1.6432600607208703
to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice.    1.5127085093302464
But there is reason in all things, and in this country the heathenish    1.67495327387791
cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands. The annual    1.67495327387791
butchery of 40,000 American men, women and children to satiate    1.5636360329510388
its blood-lust is excessive; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more    1.67495327387791
than sufficient.   No other popular idol is accorded even that much    1.6065767145351917
grace. If the railroads, for example, regularly slaughtered 25,000    1.5127085093302464
passengers each year, the high priests of the cult would have cause    1.6432600607208703
to tremble for their personal safety, for such a holocaust would excite    1.6432600607208703
demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States.    1.6432600607208703
But by comparison with the railroad, the motor car is a relatively    1.6432600607208703
new object of popular worship, so it is too much to hope that it    1.7026049541338664
may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.   1.6432600607208703
Yet it is plainly time to make a start, and to be effective    1.67495327387791
the first move should be highly dramatic, without being fanatical. Here,    1.6065767145351917
then, is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of    1.67495327387791
a beginning. From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account    1.6432600607208703
of each successive fatality on the highways, publicizing it on all    1.6065767145351917
media of communication. To avoid suspicion of bigotry, let the hand    1.6065767145351917
of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five    1.6432600607208703
thousandth corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery    1.5636360329510388
be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners.   1.6432600607208703
Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution    1.6432600607208703
on July 4, 1963. The scene, of course, should be nine miles northwest    1.67495327387791
of Centralia, Illinois, the geographical center of population according    1.5127085093302464
to the census. A special grandstand, protected by awnings from    1.5636360329510388
the midsummer sun of Illinois, should be erected for occupancy by    1.6065767145351917
honored guests, who should include the ambassadors of all those new African    1.6432600607208703
nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is    1.6065767145351917
thoroughly civilized. The band should play the Rogues' March as a    1.6065767145351917
processional, switching to "Hail Columbia, Happy Land"! as    1.4513752902486308
the trap is sprung.   Independence Day is the appropriate date    1.5636360329510388
as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments    1.6432600607208703
are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable    1.5636360329510388
rights, the first of which is life, and when any government becomes subversive    1.67495327387791
of that end, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish    1.7026049541338664
it. The highway system is an agency of government, and when it grinds    1.67495327387791
up 40,000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own    1.6065767145351917
taxpayers, which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do.   1.6432600607208703
Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government,    1.5127085093302464
but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual    1.6065767145351917
citizens, which would certainly alter it, and definitely for    1.5127085093302464
the better. Moreover, the salubrious effects would not be exclusively    1.5636360329510388
political, but at least partially, and perhaps primarily social. It    1.5636360329510388
would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some    1.67495327387791
of its ancillary beliefs and practices- for instance, the doctrine    1.5636360329510388
that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon,    1.6432600607208703
not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the    1.7026049541338664
cardinal sin of stasis, or, as it is generally termed, staying put.   1.6432600607208703
True, the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor,    1.6432600607208703
even a miniscule sect, and their credo, "Home-keeping hearts are    1.5636360329510388
happiest", is as disreputable as Socinianism. Nonetheless, although    1.4513752902486308
few in number they are a stubborn crew, as tenacious of life as the    1.7026049541338664
Hardshell Baptists, which suggests that there is some kind of vital    1.6065767145351917
principle embodied in their faith. Perhaps there is more truth than we    1.6432600607208703
are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia,    1.6432600607208703
Robert Ruark's grandfather, who was persuaded that the great curse    1.5636360329510388
of the modern world is "all this gallivantin'".   In any    1.5636360329510388
event, the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large    1.6432600607208703
to be justified by the most ardent faith. Somehow our contemporary Moloch    1.6432600607208703
must be induced to see reason. Since appeals to morality, to humanity,    1.6432600607208703
and to sanity have had such small effect, perhaps our last recourse    1.6432600607208703
is the deterrent example. If we make it established custom that    1.6065767145351917
whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive, say beyond 25,000    1.5636360329510388
<per annum>, then <somebody> is going to hang, it follows that the    1.6432600607208703
more eminent the victim, the more impressive the lesson. To hang 50    1.6432600607208703
Governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related    1.6065767145351917
to the highways; so, all things considered, the highway commissioners    1.5636360329510388
would seem to be elected.    1.1606783668269585
As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly    1.6065767145351917
around the earth, the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime    1.6432600607208703
against the human race. But the guilt is shared by the United States,    1.67495327387791
Britain and France, the other members of the atomic club. Until    1.6065767145351917
Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1, the ~US and    1.5636360329510388
~UK had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere    1.6432600607208703
as the Russians, and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still    1.6432600607208703
coming down. As it descends, the concentration of radioactivity builds    1.5636360329510388
up in the human body; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu    1.7269387314284994
virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies. The effect of    1.6065767145351917
radiation is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding generations.    1.6065767145351917
So, while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning, history    1.5636360329510388
is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the    1.67495327387791
West were so quick to assume when Mr& Khrushchev made his cynical    1.6432600607208703
and irresponsible threat. Shock, dismay and foreboding for future    1.5127085093302464
generations were legitimate reactions; a holier-than-thou sermon was    1.4513752902486308
not.   On October 19, after the Soviets had detonated at least    1.6065767145351917
20 nuclear devices, Ambassador Stevenson warned the ~UN General    1.5127085093302464
Assembly that this country, in "self protection", might have    1.5127085093302464
to resume above-ground tests. More recently, the chairman of the Atomic    1.6065767145351917
Energy Commission, Dr& Glenn T& Seaborg, "admitted"    1.3761581156320553
to a news conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the ~US might    1.6432600607208703
fall behind Russia (he apparently meant in weapons development) if the    1.6065767145351917
Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain. The    1.6065767145351917
trial balloons are afloat.   All of which makes it more imperative    1.6065767145351917
than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.    1.6432600607208703
But for the average citizen, unfortunately, this is one of science's    1.6065767145351917
worst-marked channels, full of tricky currents and unknown    1.4513752902486308
depths. The scientists, in and out of government, do not agree on some    1.67495327387791
of the most vital points, at least publicly. On the one hand, the Public    1.7026049541338664
Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present    1.5636360329510388
radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots "do not warrant    1.5636360329510388
undue public concern" or any action to limit the intake of radioactive    1.6432600607208703
substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the    1.5636360329510388
~US. But the ~PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles    1.5636360329510388
"will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations,    1.6065767145351917
and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United    1.7026049541338664
States". Then it added: "It is not possible to determine    1.5636360329510388
how extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people will    1.6432600607208703
be affected".   Having hedged its bets in this way, ~PHS    1.5636360329510388
apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination    1.6432600607208703
after all: "At present radiation levels, and even at somewhat    1.5636360329510388
higher levels, the additional risk is slight and very few people will    1.6432600607208703
be affected". Then, to conclude on an indeterminate note: "Nevertheless,    1.5636360329510388
if fallout increased substantially, or remained high for    1.4513752902486308
a long time, it would become far more important as a potential health    1.67495327387791
hazard in this country and throughout the world".   Dr& Linus    1.5636360329510388
Pauling, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, has been less ambiguous,    1.6065767145351917
whether you choose to agree with him or not. After declaring, in    1.6432600607208703
an article last month in <Frontier> magazine, that the Russian testing    1.6065767145351917
"carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences    1.5636360329510388
of any action in the history of the world", he gave this estimate    1.67495327387791
of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled    1.6432600607208703
200 megatons:   The damage to human germ plasm would be    1.5636360329510388
such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world    1.6432600607208703
would be born with gross physical or mental defects. Long-lived carbon-14    1.6065767145351917
from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic, neonatal    1.5636360329510388
or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations,    1.5636360329510388
and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have    1.6432600607208703
their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia.    1.5636360329510388
Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere, where the fallout    1.6432600607208703
is concentrating. Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from    1.5127085093302464
the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be    1.6432600607208703
too high, but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.   1.6432600607208703
The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due    1.6432600607208703
in part to insufficient data covering large population groups, from    1.5636360329510388
which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn. But more than one conscientious    1.6065767145351917
researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion    1.4513752902486308
of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout    1.6065767145351917
has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem. Its    1.67495327387791
dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe    1.6432600607208703
national security requires further testing. An illustration of this    1.5127085093302464
attitude is found in John A& McCone's letter to Dr& Thomas    1.6065767145351917
Lauritsen, reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of <The New    1.6432600607208703
Republic>.   To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies    1.5127085093302464
away from discussing the health aspects of fallout. A recent study    1.6065767145351917
on radiation exposure by the ~AEC's division of biology and    1.5636360329510388
medicine stated: "The question of the biological effect **h of [radiation]    1.6065767145351917
doses is not considered" herein. Of course, the ~AEC    1.5127085093302464
is in a bind now. If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers    1.7269387314284994
of fallout, it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.    1.6065767145351917
So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have    1.5636360329510388
been confined to one or two bleak sentences, with the fission yield usually    1.67495327387791
left vague.   Now, of course, that the Russians are the    1.5636360329510388
nuclear villains, radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid-1950s,    1.67495327387791
when the ~US was testing in the atmosphere. The prevailing    1.5636360329510388
official attitude then seemed to be that fallout, if not exactly good    1.6432600607208703
for you, might not be much worse than a bad cold. After a nuclear blast,    1.7269387314284994
one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days, about all you had    1.6065767145351917
to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof. Things    1.7269387314284994
aren't that simple anymore. Yet if Washington gets too indignant    1.5636360329510388
about Soviet fallout, it will have to do a lot of fast footwork    1.67495327387791
if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count.    1.6432600607208703
As of October 25, the ~AEC    1.2818970554302986
had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series, 12 of them in a megaton    1.7269387314284994
range, including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons    1.67495327387791
(the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of ~TNT); and    1.6432600607208703
President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported.   1.6432600607208703
Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot    1.6065767145351917
estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons, a conservative computation    1.5636360329510388
is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60    1.7026049541338664
megatons. Some government scientists say privately that the figure    1.5127085093302464
probably is closer to 80 megatons, and that the full 50-megaton bomb    1.6432600607208703
that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.   If the new    1.5636360329510388
Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian    1.5636360329510388
tests, the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion, meaning a    1.6432600607208703
fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far. To this must be added the    1.7269387314284994
90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the    1.67495327387791
atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that    1.6065767145351917
began in November, 1958.    1.0
ONE OF THE inescapable realities    1.1606783668269585
of the Cold War is that is has thrust upon the West a wholly new    1.7269387314284994
and historically unique set of moral dilemmas. The first dilemma was    1.6065767145351917
the morality of nuclear warfare itself. That dilemma is as much with    1.6432600607208703
us as ever. The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear    1.67495327387791
testing, a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present    1.6432600607208703
series of Soviet tests.   When this second dilemma first    1.5127085093302464
became    1.0
obvious- during the mid to late '50's- the United States    1.5636360329510388
appeared to have three choices. It could have unilaterally abandoned    1.5636360329510388
further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.    1.6432600607208703
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds    1.6065767145351917
that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist    1.6432600607208703
world domination. Or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation-    1.6065767145351917
some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security. This    1.6432600607208703
third choice was in fact made.   With the resumption of Soviet    1.6065767145351917
testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks, however, the    1.5636360329510388
hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken. Once    1.6432600607208703
again, the United States must choose. And once again, the    1.5636360329510388
choices    1.0
are much the same. Only this time around the conditions are different    1.6432600607208703
and the choice is far harder.   The first choice, abandoning tests    1.6065767145351917
entirely, would not only be unpopular domestically, but would surely    1.5636360329510388
be exploited by the Russians. The second choice, full testing, has    1.6065767145351917
become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have    1.6065767145351917
already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere. The third choice, negotiation,    1.5127085093302464
presupposes, as Russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal    1.4513752902486308
of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable.   We take the    1.6065767145351917
position, however, that the third choice still remains the only sane    1.6065767145351917
one open to us. It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice    1.7269387314284994
and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.    1.6065767145351917
Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice; one which, should    1.67495327387791
it fail, will not have contaminated the conscience. That is the    1.6065767145351917
LEAVING ASIDE the choice of unilateral    1.2818970554302986
cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral, the question    1.6065767145351917
must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part    1.6432600607208703
would not be a good choice. For that is the one an increasingly large    1.7026049541338664
number of prominent Americans are now proposing. In particular, Governor    1.5636360329510388
Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as    1.5127085093302464
anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.   Speaking    1.5636360329510388
recently in Miami, Governor Rockefeller said that "to assure    1.5127085093302464
the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet    1.67495327387791
tests, we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests".    1.6432600607208703
Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be    1.7026049541338664
unpopular in world opinion, he argued that the responsibility of the United    1.6432600607208703
States is "to do, confidently and firmly, not what is popular,    1.6065767145351917
but what is right".   What was missing in the Governor's    1.5636360329510388
argument, as in so many similar arguments, was a premise which would    1.6432600607208703
enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable    1.67495327387791
to what is right. The possibility, as he asserted, that the Russians    1.6432600607208703
may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests    1.7026049541338664
does not supply the needed ethical premise- unless, of course, we have    1.6432600607208703
unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken    1.5636360329510388
as a moral demand.   Besides the lack of an adequate ethical    1.6065767145351917
dimension to the Governor's case, one can ask seriously whether our    1.6065767145351917
lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons    1.6065767145351917
is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary. Recent statements    1.6432600607208703
by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have, to the    1.5636360329510388
contrary, assured us that our lead is very great. Unless the Administration    1.6432600607208703
and the Defense Department have been deceiving us, the facts    1.5636360329510388
do not support the assertion that we are "compelled" to resume atmospheric    1.6432600607208703
testing.   It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption    1.4513752902486308
of atmospheric tests may, at some point in the future, be necessary    1.6432600607208703
and even justifiable. But a resumption does not seem justifiable now.    1.6065767145351917
What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination    1.6065767145351917
of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests has radically increased our    1.6065767145351917
own moral obligations. We now have to think not only of our national    1.67495327387791
security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests    1.67495327387791
we might undertake. This is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded    1.6432600607208703
or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even    1.6065767145351917
of the evil of Communism.   Too often in the past Russian    1.6065767145351917
tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part. There ought    1.67495327387791
to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless    1.7026049541338664
of what Russia does. The refusal to resume atmospheric testing    1.5636360329510388
would be a good start.    1.1606783668269585
WHEN HIS Holiness    1.0
Pope John /23, first called for an Ecumenical Council, and at the    1.6432600607208703
same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity, the enthusiasm    1.5636360329510388
among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate. With good    1.5127085093302464
reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom. But    1.6432600607208703
as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became    1.67495327387791
known, there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides.    1.6432600607208703
The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with    1.6065767145351917
the internal affairs of the Church.   As it has turned out, however,    1.6432600607208703
the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of    1.6065767145351917
hope in the second were both wrong responses. Two things have happened    1.6432600607208703
in recent months to bring the Council into perspective: each provides    1.6065767145351917
a basis for renewed hope and joy.   First of all, it is now    1.67495327387791
known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church    1.6432600607208703
as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity. Far from    1.5636360329510388
being irrelevant to the ecumenical task, the Pontiff believes that a    1.6065767145351917
revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism    1.67495327387791
in the best possible light. Equally significant, Pope John    1.5127085093302464
has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian    1.5636360329510388
disunity. A major aim of the Council will be to remove as    1.6432600607208703
far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity.   1.7026049541338664
Secondly, a whole series of addresses and actions by the    1.5636360329510388
Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very    1.67495327387791
much alive and growing within the Church. The establishment, by the    1.6065767145351917
Holy Father, of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in    1.5636360329510388
1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern. The designation of    1.6432600607208703
five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches    1.5636360329510388
assembly in New Delhi as "official" observers reverses the Church's    1.5636360329510388
earlier stand. The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary    1.5636360329510388
of State, Cardinal Cicognani, for renewed efforts toward Eastern    1.5127085093302464
and Western reunion was still another remarkable act. Nor can one    1.6065767145351917
forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury.   1.5636360329510388
Augustin Cardinal Bea, the director of the Secretariate    1.4513752902486308
for Christian Unity, has expressed as directly as anyone the    1.5636360329510388
new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant    1.5636360329510388
and Orthodox Churches. Noting all the difficulties that stand in    1.5636360329510388
the way of reunion, he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.    1.7026049541338664
For discouragement, or the temptation to abandon our efforts, "would    1.5636360329510388
show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without    1.6065767145351917
thinking of the omnipotence of God, the irresistible efficacy of    1.5636360329510388
prayer, the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit".    1.6432600607208703
Can any Christian fail to respond to these words?    1.5127085093302464
THE ADMINISTRATION'S official budget review, which estimates    1.3761581156320553
a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year, isn't    1.6065767145351917
making anyone happy. Certainly it isn't making the President happy,    1.5636360329510388
and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget    1.67495327387791
got into its unbalanced condition, how he intends to economize wherever    1.6065767145351917
he can and how he hopes to do better next year.   We sympathize    1.67495327387791
with Mr& Kennedy, but we feel bound to say that his budget review    1.67495327387791
doesn't please us either, although for very different reasons.    1.5127085093302464
Furthermore, we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying    1.6065767145351917
than reassuring.   In the first place, a large part of the    1.6065767145351917
discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion    1.5127085093302464
dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost    1.67495327387791
seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's    1.6065767145351917
farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor. The Eisenhower    1.6065767145351917
budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and    1.4513752902486308
yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.   The    1.6065767145351917
rest of the deficit is also easily understood. Four billion dollars    1.6065767145351917
of the spending increase is for defense, an expenditure necessitated    1.5636360329510388
by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration, quite    1.5127085093302464
apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere. Four hundred    1.6065767145351917
million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program, a    1.6432600607208703
responsibility similarly neglected by Mr& Eisenhower. The farm program    1.5127085093302464
will cost an additional 1.5 billion, because of unusual weather    1.5636360329510388
factors, the Food for Peace program and other new measures. Anti-recession    1.6065767145351917
programs- aid for the unemployed, their children and for depressed    1.5636360329510388
areas- account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar    1.6065767145351917
deficit.   Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy    1.6065767145351917
programs are not too large but too small, most seriously in regard    1.6432600607208703
to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.    1.6065767145351917
And yet Mr& Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents    1.6065767145351917
of the right with apologies and promises of "tightening up" and    1.6065767145351917
"economizing". We wish the President would remember that "fiscal    1.5127085093302464
responsibility" was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.    1.6065767145351917
The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier.    1.6432600607208703
INTRODUCTION of the "dialogue" principle    1.1606783668269585
proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting    1.4513752902486308
of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington    1.5127085093302464
the last weekend in October. Two of the principal addresses were delivered    1.6432600607208703
by prominent Protestants, and when the speaker was a Catholic,    1.5636360329510388
one "discussant" on the dais tended to be of another religious    1.6065767145351917
persuasion.   Several effects were immediately evident. Sessions    1.3761581156320553
devoted to "Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends", "Moral Principle    1.5127085093302464
and Political Judgment", "Christian Ethics in the Cold    1.4513752902486308
War" and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this    1.6065767145351917
procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves. Usually    1.5636360329510388
questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker    1.5636360329510388
or discussion leader.   In the earlier sessions there was plentiful    1.5636360329510388
discussion on the natural law, which Dr& William V& O'Brien    1.5636360329510388
of Georgetown University, advanced as the basis for widely acceptable    1.5636360329510388
ethical judgments on foreign policy. That Aristotelean-Thomistic    1.3761581156320553
principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the    1.5636360329510388
participants, but in the end the concept came to reassert itself. Speakers    1.6432600607208703
declared that Protestants often make use of it, if, perhaps,    1.5636360329510388
by some other name. A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and    1.6432600607208703
application in the Islamic tradition as the "divine law", while a    1.6065767145351917
C&A&I&P& member who has been working in close association    1.5127085093302464
with delegates of the new U&N& nations told of its widespread recognition    1.6432600607208703
on the African continent. The impression was unmistakable    1.4513752902486308
that, whatever one may choose to call it, natural law is a functioning    1.67495327387791
generality with a certain objective existence.   Another question    1.4513752902486308
that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself. The stimulus from    1.6432600607208703
the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences    1.4513752902486308
was undeniable. It was expected that the comparison of different    1.5636360329510388
approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's    1.6065767145351917
positions and better comprehension of one's own. But a realization    1.5636360329510388
that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed,    1.7026049541338664
and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions    1.6065767145351917
to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political    1.5127085093302464
issues.   One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these    1.5127085093302464
discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity    1.6065767145351917
of being armed with the facts: knowledge of the destructive    1.5636360329510388
force of even the tiniest "tactical" atomic weapon would have a bearing    1.6432600607208703
on judgments as to the advisability of its use- to defend Berlin,    1.6432600607208703
for example; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political    1.5636360329510388
judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account; it    1.6065767145351917
is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian    1.67495327387791
imperative.    1.0
Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question. I was searching    1.67495327387791
for an accent of self-delusion or, even, of hypocrisy. I never    1.6065767145351917
found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke, though granted    1.67495327387791
they were, almost all, members of the official family who, presumably,    1.6065767145351917
harbor official thoughts. But I questioned, also, professional soldiers,    1.5127085093302464
who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy    1.5636360329510388
irredentism. Their answer was: it can be done, and we will do it.    1.67495327387791
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang    1.7026049541338664
Kai-shek: "In America", I said, "practically no one    1.4513752902486308
believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland. What    1.5636360329510388
evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government    1.6432600607208703
proposes to do just that, and that it can be done"?   He smiled.    1.67495327387791
(He always smiles- at least at visitors, I gather. He smiled    1.6065767145351917
also at a British bloke seated next to me, who asked the most asinine    1.7026049541338664
questions. I recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's    1.5127085093302464
"My Last Duchess". **h) He smiled, and said a word    1.5636360329510388
or two to the interpreter, who turned to me, "The President wonders    1.6432600607208703
where you are going after you leave Taipei"? That, I smarted,    1.6065767145351917
is a royal rebuff if ever there was one.   I answered the routine    1.67495327387791
question about my itinerary, rather coolly. Chiang spoke again,    1.5127085093302464
this    1.0
time at greater length. "The President says", the translator    1.5127085093302464
came in, "that the reason he asked you where you were going is because    1.7026049541338664
he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia, and    1.6432600607208703
that everywhere you went, you would seek the answer to your question.    1.6432600607208703
He says that if he were to express to you, once again, his own profound    1.7269387314284994
determination to go to the Mainland, and his faith that that return    1.6432600607208703
is feasible, he would merely sound redundant. So you yourself must    1.6065767145351917
seek these objective data, and come to your own conclusions. Any information    1.6432600607208703
we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal".   Fair    1.5636360329510388
enough. What are the relevant data? For every person on Taiwan, there    1.6432600607208703
are sixty in Mainland China. If the raw population figures are    1.6065767145351917
crucially relevant, then it is idle to think of liberation, as idle as    1.67495327387791
to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia. Relative military manpower?    1.5636360329510388
Less than 60-1, but at least 6-1. The estimates vary widely    1.6065767145351917
on the strength of the Chinese army. Say four million. The armed    1.6432600607208703
forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000, though    1.6432600607208703
a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated. Skill? Training?    1.5636360329510388
Morale? It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force    1.5636360329510388
is the best by far in Asia, and the army the best trained. The morale    1.7269387314284994
is very high.   Even so, it adds up to impossible odds, except    1.6432600607208703
that the question arises, On whose side would the Mainland Chinese    1.6065767145351917
army fight?   The miserable people of China, the largest cast    1.5636360329510388
ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play, cannot themselves    1.5636360329510388
resist overtly. They think, perforce, of physical survival:    1.4513752902486308
everything else is secondary. But the army which Mao continues to feed    1.6432600607208703
well, where are its sympathies? The psychological strategists in    1.5127085093302464
Taiwan stress the great sense of family, cultivated in China over    1.6065767145351917
thousands of years. It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist    1.67495327387791
depersonalization. Every soldier in the army has, somewhere, relatives    1.5127085093302464
who are close to starvation. The soldiers themselves cannot stage    1.5636360329510388
a successful rebellion, it is assumed: but will their discontent    1.5636360329510388
spread to the officer class? The immediate families of the generals    1.6065767145351917
and the admirals are well fed: a despot does not economize on his    1.67495327387791
generals. But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews. Their privations    1.6432600607208703
are almost beyond endurance. In behalf of what? Leninism-Marxism,    1.5127085093302464
as understood by Exegete Mao. To whom will the generals stay    1.6065767145351917
loyal? There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot, they    1.6432600607208703
would vote for food for their family, in place of ideological purity out    1.67495327387791
on the farm. It is another question whether "they"- or a single    1.6432600607208703
general, off in a corner of China, secure for a few (galvanizing?)    1.6432600607208703
days at least from instant retaliation- will defy the Party. But    1.6065767145351917
But there    1.0
must be a catalytic pressure. The military in Taiwan believe that    1.6065767145351917
the Communists have made two mistakes, which, together, may prove fatal.    1.6065767145351917
The first was the commune program, which will ensure agricultural    1.5636360329510388
poverty for years. The family is largely broken up; and where it    1.6432600607208703
is not, it is left with no residue, and the social meaning of this is    1.7269387314284994
enormous. For it is the family that, in China, has always provided social    1.67495327387791
security for the indigent, the sick, the down-and-out members of    1.5636360329510388
the clan. Now the government must do that; but the government is    1.6432600607208703
left with no reserve granary, under the agricultural system it has ordained.    1.6432600607208703
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of    1.5127085093302464
social security which had traditionally been privately discharged, and    1.5127085093302464
created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems    1.5127085093302464
of social security.   The second mistake is Tibet. Tibet has    1.5636360329510388
historically served China as a buffer state. A friendly state, sometimes    1.6065767145351917
only semi-independent, but never hostile. China never tried to    1.5127085093302464
integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions.    1.5127085093302464
Red China is trying to do this, and she is not likely ever to succeed.    1.7269387314284994
Tibet is too vast, the terrain is too difficult. Tibet may bleed    1.6432600607208703
China as Algeria is bleeding France.   These continuing    1.4513752902486308
pressures, social, economic and military, are doing much to keep China    1.6065767145351917
in a heightening state of tension. The imposition of yet another pressure,    1.6432600607208703
The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men. They know that    1.6432600607208703
they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control. First    1.6065767145351917
and foremost, they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime.    1.6432600607208703
On these they feel they can rely. Secondly, they depend on America's    1.6432600607208703
"moral cooperation" when the crucial moment arrives. They    1.4513752902486308
hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest, we will    1.6065767145351917
receive the opportunity gladly. I remarked jocularly to the President    1.5636360329510388
that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite    1.7026049541338664
a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd    1.6065767145351917
day. He affected (most properly) not to understand my point. But he-    1.6432600607208703
and all of China- wear the scars of American indecisiveness, and    1.6065767145351917
he knows what an uncertain ally we are. We have been grand to Formosa    1.7026049541338664
itself- lots of aid, and, most of the time, a policy of support    1.67495327387791
for the offshore islands. But our outlook has been, and continues to    1.6432600607208703
be, defensive. A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Kennedy's views on the world struggle. The Free Chinese know that    1.6065767145351917
the situation on the Mainland is in flux, and are poised to strike.    1.67495327387791
There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized    1.67495327387791
force for liberation.    1.0
The moment of truth is the moment of crisis. During the slow buildup,    1.67495327387791
the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details,    1.67495327387791
fine words, strutting gestures. The crisis burns these suddenly    1.5127085093302464
away. There the truth is, open to eyes that are willing to look. The    1.7026049541338664
moment passes. New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked    1.6065767145351917
bones.   A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for    1.4513752902486308
a couple of days this month, to be quickly smothered by the high pressure    1.7026049541338664
verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies. Before memory,    1.6432600607208703
too, clouds over, let us make a note or two of what could be seen.   1.7269387314284994
The measure was instantly taken, as always in such cases, of    1.6065767145351917
public men at many levels. One knows better, now, who has bone and    1.67495327387791
who    1.0
has jelly in his spine. But I am here concerned more with policy    1.67495327387791
than with men. Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.   1.7026049541338664
Now, everyone knows- or knew in the week of December 10-    1.6065767145351917
that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy.    1.5636360329510388
The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful,    1.6432600607208703
orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most    1.6432600607208703
pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations-    1.5127085093302464
the only place in Africa, moreover, where a productive relationship    1.5636360329510388
between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved. Of course the    1.6065767145351917
fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations. But    1.6065767145351917
in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U&S& was    1.6432600607208703
in reality the principal.   The moment simultaneously revealed that    1.5127085093302464
in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our ~NATO    1.67495327387791
allies, to the entire Western community. By our policy the West was-    1.6432600607208703
is- split.   But the key revelation is not new. The controlling    1.6065767145351917
pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November    1.5636360329510388
1956. It reappears, in whole or part, whenever a new crisis    1.6065767145351917
exposes the reality: in Cuba last spring (with which the Dominican    1.6065767145351917
events of last month should be paired); at the peaks of the nuclear    1.67495327387791
test and the Berlin cycles; in relation to Laos, Algeria, South    1.6065767145351917
Africa; right now, with almost cartoon emphasis, in the temporally    1.5636360329510388
linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana.    1.0
This prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:    1.6065767145351917
<Under prevailing policy, the U& S& can take the initiative    1.5636360329510388
against the Right, but cannot take the initiative against the Left>.    1.6065767145351917
It makes no difference what part of the world is involved, what form    1.67495327387791
of regime, what particular issue. <The U& S& cannot take the    1.6065767145351917
initiative against the Left>. There is even some question whether    1.5636360329510388
the U& S& can any longer <defend> itself against an initiative    1.6065767145351917
by the Left.   We can attack Tshombe, but not Gigenza. No    1.6065767145351917
matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo. No matter that    1.6432600607208703
it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men. No matter    1.7026049541338664
that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western    1.6065767145351917
interests in Africa. (Even granted that the Congo should be    1.5636360329510388
unified, you don't protect Western security by <first> removing    1.5127085093302464
the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium.)   We can force    1.5636360329510388
Britain and France out of the Suez, but we cannot so much as <try>    1.7026049541338664
to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest. We can mass our    1.6432600607208703
fleet against the Trujillos, but not against the Castros. We can    1.6065767145351917
vote in the ~UN against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule    1.6065767145351917
in Angola, but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall-    1.67495327387791
much less, give the simple order to push the Wall down. We officially    1.67495327387791
receive the anti-French, Moscow-allied Algerian    1.1606783668269585
~FLN,    1.0
but we denounce the pro-Europe, anti-Communist ~OAS as criminal.   1.5127085093302464
In the very week of our war against Katanga, we make a $133    1.67495327387791
million grant to Kwame Nkrumah, who has just declared his solidarity    1.6065767145351917
with the Communist bloc, and is busily turning his own country into    1.6432600607208703
a totalitarian dictatorship. As our planes land the war materiel that    1.6065767145351917
kills pro-Western Katangans, we stand supinely bleating while Nehru's    1.5127085093302464
troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our ~NATO    1.5127085093302464
ally, Portugal.   What explains this uni-directional paralysis?    1.3761581156320553
It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes    1.6065767145351917
the frame of our international- and in some degree our domestic-    1.6065767145351917
policy. The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not    1.5636360329510388
invented by the new Administration, but only made more consistent and    1.6065767145351917
more active.    1.0
Most immediately relevant to these    1.1606783668269585
episodes in Goa, Katanga and Ghana, as to the Suez-Hungary crisis    1.6065767145351917
before them, is the belief that the main theater of the world drama    1.67495327387791
is the underdeveloped region of Asia, Africa and Latin America.    1.5636360329510388
From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy    1.6065767145351917
on the "uncommitted" ("neutralist", "contested") nations,    1.2818970554302986
especially on those whose leaders make the most noise- Nehru, Tito,    1.6065767145351917
Nkrumah, Sukarno, Betancourt, etc&. Our chief aim becomes that    1.5127085093302464
of finding favor in neutralist eyes.   If we grasp this orientation    1.6065767145351917
as a key, our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned    1.67495327387791
becomes intelligible. And it becomes clear why in general we cannot    1.6065767145351917
take the initiative against the Left.    1.2818970554302986
_THE UNORIGINALS_ To write a play, the dramatist once    1.5127085093302464
needed an idea plus the imagination, the knowledge of life and the    1.6432600607208703
craft to develop it. Nowadays, more and more, all he needs is someone    1.67495327387791
else's book. To get started, he does not scan the world about him;    1.67495327387791
he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists. So    1.6065767145351917
far this season, Broadway's premieres have included twice as many    1.5636360329510388
adaptations and imports as original American stage plays. _BEST FROM    1.5636360329510388
ABROAD._ Of straight dramas, there are <All the Way Home,>    1.5636360329510388
which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel, <A Death    1.7026049541338664
in the Family; The Wall,> awkwardly based on the John Hersey    1.6065767145351917
novel; <Advise and Consent,> lively but shallow theater drawn    1.5127085093302464
from the mountainously detailed bestseller; <Face of a Hero> (closed),    1.5636360329510388
based on a Pierre Boulle novel. The only original works    1.5636360329510388
attempting    1.0
to reach any stature: Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic    1.4513752902486308
comedy, <Period of Adjustment,> and Arthur Laurents' clever    1.4513752902486308
but empty <Invitation to a March>. Clearly the most provocative    1.5636360329510388
plays are all imported originals- <A Taste of Honey,> by Britain's    1.6065767145351917
young (19 when she wrote it) Shelagh Delaney; <Becket,>    1.5127085093302464
by France's Jean Anouilh; <The Hostage> (closed), by Ireland's    1.5127085093302464
Brendan Behan.   Among the musicals, <Camelot> came    1.3761581156320553
from T& H& White's <The Once and Future King,> and novels    1.6065767145351917
were the sources of the less than momentous <Tenderloin> and <Do    1.6065767145351917
Re Mi. Wildcat> and <The Unsinkable Molly Brown> were originals,    1.5636360329510388
but pretty bad, leaving top honors again to an import- the    1.6065767145351917
jaunty and charmingly French <Irma La Douce>. The only other works    1.6065767145351917
at least technically original were dreary farces- <Send Me No    1.5636360329510388
Flowers> (closed), <Under the Yum-Yum Tree, Critic's Choice>.    1.4513752902486308
In the forthcoming <The Conquering Hero> and <Carnival,>    1.4513752902486308
Broadway is not even adapting books, but reconverting old movies    1.5636360329510388
(<Hail the Conquering Hero> and <Lili>). _DRY OF LIFE._    1.5127085093302464
Originals    1.0
are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily    1.5127085093302464
bad. Some memorable plays have been drawn from books, notably <Life    1.6065767145351917
with Father> and <Diary of Anne Frank>. And particularly in the    1.6065767145351917
musical field, adaptations have long been the rule, from <Die Fledermaus>    1.6065767145351917
and <The Merry Widow> to <Oklahoma!> and <My Fair    1.5127085093302464
Lady>. As Critic Walter Kerr points out: "Adaptations,    1.4513752902486308
so long as they are good, still qualify as creative". And other defenders    1.67495327387791
invariably argue that, after all, Shakespeare and Moliere were    1.5127085093302464
adapters too. The difference is that the masters took the bare frame    1.6432600607208703
of a plot and filled it with their own world; most modern adapters    1.67495327387791
totally accept the world of a book, squeeze it dry of life, and add only    1.7269387314284994
one contribution of their own: stage technique.   The most    1.5127085093302464
frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports    1.5636360329510388
is increasing production expense- producers cannot afford to take chances.    1.5636360329510388
But that explanation is only partly true. Off-Broadway, where    1.5127085093302464
production is still comparatively cheap, is proving itself only slightly    1.5636360329510388
more original. Laudably enough, it is offering classics and off-beat    1.5636360329510388
imports, but last week only one U&S& original was on the boards,    1.6432600607208703
Robert D& Hock's stunning Civil War work, <Borak>. The    1.5127085093302464
real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U&S& playwrights.    1.6065767145351917
_THE COOCH TERPERS_ <He: "Come    1.1606783668269585
with me to the casbah". She: "By subway or cab"?>    1.5636360329510388
That exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan,    1.6432600607208703
as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and    1.6065767145351917
Eighth Avenue, where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like    1.6065767145351917
Arabian Nights, Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American    1.5636360329510388
inpost of belly dancing. Several more will open soon. Their    1.5636360329510388
burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street    1.67495327387791
burlesque joints, but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always    1.5636360329510388
familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.    1.4513752902486308
The belly <boites,> with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted    1.5636360329510388
Ionic columns, heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek    1.5636360329510388
and Turkish families. Customers often bring their children; between    1.5127085093302464
performances, enthusiastic young men from the audience will take    1.5127085093302464
the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces. Except for the odd    1.6432600607208703
uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor, the people watch in    1.6432600607208703
calm absorption. Small, shirt-sleeved    1.0
orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time,    1.3761581156320553
using guitars, violins, and more alien instruments with names that    1.5636360329510388
would open Sesame: the oud, grandfather of the lute; the darbuka,    1.6065767145351917
a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass; the def,    1.67495327387791
a low-pitched tambourine. The girls sit quietly with the musicians, wearing    1.6065767145351917
prim dresses or plain, secretarial shifts, until it is time to    1.6065767145351917
go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem.    1.7269387314284994
_CONTINUUM OF MANKIND._ If a dancer is good, she suggests purely    1.6065767145351917
and    1.0
superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny- the continuum    1.5636360329510388
of mankind. But a great many of what <Variety> calls the    1.6065767145351917
"cooch terpers" are considerably less cosmic than that. Each dancer    1.5636360329510388
follows the ancient Oriental pattern- she glides sideways with    1.5127085093302464
shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates, and, through breathing    1.5127085093302464
and muscle control, she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips    1.6432600607208703
and away to the far end of the room. This is done at varying speeds,    1.7269387314284994
ranging from the slow and fast <Shifte Telli> (a musical term    1.6065767145351917
meaning    1.0
double strings) to the fastest, ecstatic <Karshilama> (meaning    1.4513752902486308
greetings or welcome). The New York dancers are highly eclectic, varying    1.6065767145351917
the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations, back bends    1.5636360329510388
or floor crawls. But they do not strip. The striptease is crass;    1.6432600607208703
the belly dance leaves more to the imagination.   When a dancer    1.6065767145351917
does well, she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills- although    1.6065767145351917
the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping    1.5636360329510388
the tips into the dancers' costumes. With tips, the girls average    1.6065767145351917
between $150 and $200 a week, depending on basic salary. Although    1.6065767145351917
they are forbidden to sit with the customers, the dancers are sometimes    1.6432600607208703
proffered drinks, and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.    1.6432600607208703
_THE MELTING POT._ All over the country, belly clubs have never    1.6065767145351917
been bigger, especially in Detroit, Boston and Chicago, and even    1.5636360329510388
in small towns; one of the best dancers, a Turkish girl named Semra,    1.67495327387791
works at a roadhouse outside Bristol, Conn&. The girls are kept    1.6065767145351917
booked and moving by several agents, notably voluble, black-bearded    1.5127085093302464
Murat Somay, a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central    1.67495327387791
abdomen. He can offer nine Turkish girls, plans to import at least    1.6432600607208703
15 more. But a great many of the dancers are more or less native. Sometimes    1.7269387314284994
they get their initial experience in church <haflis,> conducted    1.5127085093302464
by Lebanese and Syrians in the U&S&, where they dance with    1.6065767145351917
just as    1.0
few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.   As the    1.5636360329510388
girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins, the melting    1.6432600607208703
pot has never bubbled more intriguingly. Some Manhattan examples:   1.5127085093302464
@ Jemela (surname: Gerby), 23, seems Hong Kong Oriental    1.4513752902486308
but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother, was born in America    1.67495327387791
and educated at    1.0
Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School, says    1.4513752902486308
she learned belly dancing at family picnics.   @ Serene (Mrs&    1.5127085093302464
Wilson), 23, was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan. Daughter    1.6065767145351917
of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance, she is one of the few    1.7269387314284994
really beautiful girls in the New York casbah, with dark eyes and dark,    1.67495327387791
waist-length hair, the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe,    1.6065767145351917
glimmering body. Many belly dancers are married, but Serene is one    1.6065767145351917
of the few who will admit it.   @ Marlene (surname: Adamo),    1.5636360329510388
25, a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends    1.6065767145351917
in Paris, now lives on Manhattan's West Side, is about the best    1.6432600607208703
belly dancer working the casbah, loves it so much that she dances on    1.67495327387791
her day off. She has the small, highly developed body of a prime athlete,    1.7026049541338664
and holds in contempt the "girls who just move sex".   @    1.5636360329510388
Leila (Malia Phillips), 25, is a Greenwich Village painter of    1.5636360329510388
Persianesque miniatures    1.0
who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles.    1.5636360329510388
A graduate of Hollywood High School, she likes to imagine herself,    1.6065767145351917
as she takes the floor, "a village girl coming in to a festival".   1.67495327387791
@ Gloria (surname: Ziraldo), circa 30, who was born    1.4513752902486308
in Italy and once did "chorus work" in Toronto, has been around    1.6432600607208703
longer than most of the others, wistfully remembers the old days    1.6065767145351917
when    1.0
"we used to get the seamen from the ships, you know, with big turtleneck    1.7026049541338664
sweaters and handkerchiefs and all. But the ships are very slow    1.6065767145351917
now, and we don't get so many sailors any more". The uptown crowd    1.67495327387791
has moved in, and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck    1.7026049541338664
sweater for a button-down collar?    1.1606783668269585
Of the handful of painters that Austria    1.3761581156320553
has produced in the 20th century, only one, Oskar Kokoschka, is widely    1.6432600607208703
known in the U&S&. This state of unawareness may not last    1.6065767145351917
much longer. For ten years a small group of European and U&S&    1.6432600607208703
critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten Austrian    1.5127085093302464
expressionist    1.0
Egon Schiele, who died 42 years ago at the age of 28. The    1.67495327387791
critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U&S& exhibit    1.5127085093302464
of Schiele's works. The show has been to Boston and Manhattan,    1.6065767145351917
will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. Last week it opened    1.6065767145351917
at the J& B& Speed Museum in Louisville, at the very moment    1.6432600607208703
that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau    1.67495327387791
gallery in Los Angeles.   Schiele's paintings are anything    1.4513752902486308
but pleasant. His people (<see color>) are angular and knobby-knuckled,    1.5636360329510388
sometimes painfully stretched, sometimes grotesquely foreshortened.    1.2818970554302986
His colors are dark and murky, and his landscapes and cityscapes    1.6065767145351917
seem swallowed in gloom. But he painted some of the boldest and    1.6432600607208703
most original pictures of his time, and even after nearly half a century,    1.67495327387791
the tense, tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its    1.67495327387791
fascination. _THE DEVIL HIMSELF._ The son of a railway stationmaster,    1.5636360329510388
Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town    1.6065767145351917
of Tulln, 14 miles northwest of Vienna. He was an emotional, lonely    1.6432600607208703
boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely    1.67495327387791
any schoolwork. When he was 15, his parents finally allowed him to attend    1.67495327387791
classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Even there he    1.6432600607208703
did not last for long. Cried one professor after a few months of Student    1.7026049541338664
Schiele's tantrums and rebellion: "The devil himself must    1.4513752902486308
have defecated you into my classroom"!   For a while his    1.5636360329510388
work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists, and by the patterned,    1.6432600607208703
mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt, then the dean of Austrian    1.5636360329510388
art. Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own-    1.5636360329510388
and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter. His pictures were    1.6432600607208703
roundly denounced as "the most disgusting things one has ever seen    1.6065767145351917
in Vienna". He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and    1.6065767145351917
jailed for 24 days- the first three of which he spent desperately trying    1.67495327387791
to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle. For years he    1.67495327387791
wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars, was even driven    1.5636360329510388
to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters. Drafted    1.5127085093302464
into    1.0
the Austrian army, he rebelliously rejected discipline, wangled a Vienna    1.5636360329510388
billet, went on painting. It was not until the last year of his    1.67495327387791
life that he had his first moneymaking show. _MELANCHOLY OBSESSION._    1.5636360329510388
The unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings was not the    1.6432600607208703
only    1.0
thing that kept the public at bay: his view of the world was one of    1.7269387314284994
almost unrelieved tragedy, and it was too much even for morbid-minded    1.6065767145351917
Vienna. He was obsessed by disease and poverty, by the melancholy of    1.6432600607208703
old age and the tyranny of lust. The children he painted were almost    1.67495327387791
always in rags, his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness,    1.67495327387791
and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were stringy,    1.4513752902486308
contorted and strangely pathetic. The subject he liked most was the    1.6065767145351917
female body, which he painted in every state- naked, half-dressed,    1.5636360329510388
muffled to the ears, sitting primly in a chair, lying tauntingly on a    1.67495327387791
bed or locked in an embrace.    1.2818970554302986
THE MOST surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of    1.5127085093302464
the Soviet Communist Party is that it <was> surprising- perhaps    1.5636360329510388
quite as much, in its own way, as the Twentieth Congress of 1956, which    1.7026049541338664
ended with that famous "secret" report on Stalin. The publication    1.5636360329510388
last July of the party's Draft Program- that blueprint for    1.5636360329510388
the "transition to communism"- had led the uninitiated to suppose    1.5636360329510388
that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis    1.5636360329510388
of the Khrushchev regime, a solemn consecration of ideas which had, in    1.6432600607208703
fact, been current over the last three or four years (i&e&, since    1.6432600607208703
the defeat of the "anti-party group") in all theoretical party    1.5636360329510388
journals. These never ceased to suggest that if, in the eyes of Marx    1.67495327387791
and Lenin "full communism" was still a very distant ideal, the establishment    1.6432600607208703
of a Communist society had now, under Khrushchev, become    1.5127085093302464
an "immediate and tangible reality". It seems that Khrushchev    1.5127085093302464
himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution    1.6432600607208703
to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program (a large part of    1.6065767145351917
his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was, in fact, very largely    1.6432600607208703
a rehash of that interminable document). He and other Soviet leaders    1.6065767145351917
responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward    1.5636360329510388
some new formulas, such as the early replacement of the dictatorship    1.6065767145351917
of the proletariat by an "All People's State", and also of having    1.6432600607208703
laid down the lines for a much greater "democratization" of    1.5636360329510388
the whole hierarchy of Soviets, starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.    1.6065767145351917
Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at    1.6065767145351917
"bureaucracy" and would enable "the people" to take a more direct    1.6065767145351917
and active part in running the country. Also, elections would be    1.6065767145351917
more democratic; there might even be two or more candidates for voters    1.6432600607208703
to choose from.   No doubt, there was still a lot in the Draft    1.67495327387791
Program- and in Khrushchev's speech- which left many points    1.5127085093302464
obscure. Was it the party's intention, for example, to abolish gradually    1.6065767145351917
the <kolkhoz> system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning    1.5127085093302464
<sovkhozes>, i&e&, state farms (which were, moreover, to be progressively    1.5636360329510388
"urbanized")? As we know, the Soviet peasant today    1.4513752902486308
still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on    1.67495327387791
his private plot; and it is still very far from certain how valid    1.67495327387791
the party's claim is that in "a growing number of <kolkhozes>"    1.6065767145351917
the peasants are finding it more profitable, to surrender their private    1.6065767145351917
plots to the    1.0
<kolkhoz> and to let the latter be turned into something    1.5636360329510388
increasingly like a state farm. If one follows the reports of the    1.6432600607208703
Congress, one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty    1.5127085093302464
in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this    1.7026049541338664
matter.   The Draft Program was interesting in other respects,    1.5127085093302464
too. It contained, for example, a number of curious admissions about    1.6065767145351917
the peasants, who enjoy no sickness benefits, no old-age pensions,    1.5636360329510388
no paid holidays; they still benefit far less than the "other" 50    1.6432600607208703
per cent of the nation from that "welfare state" which the Soviet    1.6432600607208703
OVER ALL these    1.0
fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly;    1.5127085093302464
and, though he repeated, over and over again, the spectacular figures    1.6065767145351917
of industrial and agricultural production in 1980, the "ordinary"    1.5127085093302464
people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how "communism"    1.6432600607208703
is really going to work in practice, especially in respect of food.    1.6432600607208703
Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry? This was something    1.5636360329510388
on which K& himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept    1.6432600607208703
on threatening that he would "pull the ears" of those responsible    1.6065767145351917
for agricultural production. And, as we know, the Virgin Lands are    1.6065767145351917
<not> producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped.   One cannot    1.5636360329510388
but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's    1.5636360329510388
agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the    1.67495327387791
big surprises provided by this Congress- the obsessive harping on the    1.6065767145351917
crimes and misdeeds of the "anti-party group"- Molotov, Malenkov,    1.5127085093302464
Kaganovich and others- including the eighty-year-old Marshal    1.3761581156320553
Voroshilov. Molotov, in particular, is being charged with all kinds    1.5636360329510388
of sins- especially with wanting to cut down free public services,    1.6065767145351917
to increase rents and fares; in fact, with having been against <all>    1.6432600607208703
the more popular features of the Khrushchev "welfare state".    1.5127085093302464
The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one    1.67495327387791
side of the story: what, in the secret councils of the Kremlin,    1.6432600607208703
Molotov had <really> proposed, we just don't know, and he has had    1.6432600607208703
BUT ONE cannot escape the suspicion    1.2818970554302986
that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated    1.6432600607208703
"anti-party" group would be totally unnecessary if there were not,    1.5636360329510388
inside the party, some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on    1.6065767145351917
vital doctrinal grounds, on the actual methods to be employed in the    1.6432600607208703
"transition to communism" and, last but not least, on foreign policy.   1.6065767145351917
The whole problem of "peaceful coexistence and peaceful    1.4513752902486308
competition" with the capitalist world is in the very center of this    1.6432600607208703
Congress. Mikoyan declared:   "Molotov altogether rejects    1.2818970554302986
the line of peaceful coexistence, reducing this concept merely to the    1.6065767145351917
state of peace or rather, the absence of war at a given moment, and    1.7026049541338664
to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war. His views, in    1.7026049541338664
fact, coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence,    1.5636360329510388
who look upon it merely as a variant of the "cold war" or of an "armed    1.748515906000203
peace"".   One cannot help wondering whether Molotov    1.3761581156320553
and the rest of the "anti-party group" are not being used as China's    1.67495327387791
whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers. For    1.4513752902486308
something, clearly, has gone very, very seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese    1.5636360329510388
relations, which were never easy, and have now deteriorated.   1.5127085093302464
The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev, together    1.5127085093302464
with the everlasting attacks on Molotov + Co&, has shifted the whole    1.6065767145351917
attention of the world, including that of the Soviet people, from    1.6065767145351917
the "epoch-making" twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese    1.4513752902486308
conflict. Not only, as we know, did Chou En-lai publicly treat    1.6065767145351917
Khrushchev's attack on Albania as "something that we cannot consider    1.5636360329510388
as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach" to the problem (i&e&,    1.5127085093302464
as something thoroughly dictatorial and "undemocratic"), but    1.3761581156320553
the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to    1.67495327387791
Khrushchev, calling him a liar, a bully, and so on. It is extremely    1.67495327387791
doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists    1.5636360329510388
could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends.    1.6432600607208703
The big question is whether, in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet    1.6432600607208703
solidarity, the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians    1.5127085093302464
to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev- or get rid of    1.6065767145351917
Enver Hoxa. These seem about the only two ways in which the "unhappy    1.67495327387791
incident" can now be closed.   But Albania is merely a symptom    1.6065767145351917
of a real malaise between China and Russia. There are other    1.6065767145351917
symptoms. Khrushchev, for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable    1.5636360329510388
decay of capitalism, is genuinely favorable to "peaceful coexistence"    1.5127085093302464
and would like, above all, the Berlin and German problems    1.5636360329510388
to be settled peacefully; he knows that he was never more popular than    1.67495327387791
at the time of the Russo-American "honeymoon" of 1959. But    1.5636360329510388
it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere- in the    1.6432600607208703
first place from China, but perhaps also from that "China Lobby"    1.6065767145351917
which, I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago, exists on    1.6432600607208703
the quiet inside the party. To these people, solidarity and unity with    1.6432600607208703
China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy. And the    1.6432600607208703
Chinese, as the Albanian incident shows, have strong suspicions that    1.5636360329510388
Khrushchev is anxious to secure a "shameful" peace with the West.    1.6065767145351917
The fact that China (which is obsessed by Formosa- to Khrushchev    1.6065767145351917
a very small matter) should be supported by North Korea and North    1.6432600607208703
Vietnam is highly indicative. And one cannot but wonder whether    1.5636360329510388
Marshal Malinovsky,    1.0
who was blowing hot and cold, exalting peace but    1.5127085093302464
also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against    1.5636360329510388
the West, wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet. And this    1.6065767145351917
brings us inevitably to the 30-    1.2818970554302986
or 50-megaton bomb. Was not this dropped    1.3761581156320553
primarily in order to "appease" the Chinese- especially after    1.5127085093302464
"Khrushchev's "humiliating" surrender to the West in canceling    1.4513752902486308
the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31?   What    1.4513752902486308
does it all add up to? Indications are that Khrushchev (and, with    1.6432600607208703
him, the bulk of the Soviet people) favor peaceful coexistence and (with    1.6432600607208703
the exception of Berlin) the maintenance of the <status quo> in    1.6065767145351917
the world. The Chinese, North Vietnamese and North Koreans, on    1.5636360329510388
the other hand, feel that, militarily, Russia is strong enough to support    1.6432600607208703
them in the "just wars of liberation" they would like to embark    1.6432600607208703
on before long: with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans    1.6065767145351917
and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective    1.5636360329510388
countries.   Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult    1.4513752902486308
position than any since 1957, when the "anti-party group" nearly    1.5636360329510388
liquidated him. He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with    1.6432600607208703
any internal opposition; but if he is up against China's crusading    1.6065767145351917
spirit in world affairs, he is going to be faced with the most agonizing    1.7026049541338664
choice in his life. He may support China (but he won't); he    1.6432600607208703
may break with China (which would be infernally difficult and perhaps    1.6065767145351917
disastrous), or he may succeed, by all kinds of dangerous concessions,    1.6065767145351917
in persuading China to be patient. The next days may show where things    1.67495327387791
stand.    1.0
ON a misty Sunday morning last month, a small band of militant    1.6432600607208703
anti-Communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field    1.5636360329510388
about fifteen miles east of here. Eleven men, a woman and a teen-age    1.67495327387791
boy tramped over cold, damp, fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour    1.5636360329510388
field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.   To the average    1.6065767145351917
American, this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday    1.6065767145351917
night ~TV movie. But to the Minutemen, this is a serious business.    1.6432600607208703
They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death    1.6065767145351917
struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy. They feel    1.5636360329510388
that World War /3, has already begun, and they are setting themselves    1.6432600607208703
up as a "last line of defense" against the Communist advance.   1.6065767145351917
Their national leader, Robert Bolivar DePugh of Norborne,    1.4513752902486308
Mo&, says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best    1.5636360329510388
suited to defeat the Red onslaught. In their maneuvers last month,    1.6065767145351917
they wore World War /2, camouflage garb and helmets, and carried unloaded    1.6432600607208703
~M-1 rifles.   The maneuvers were held "in secret"    1.4513752902486308
after a regional seminar for the Minutemen, held in nearby Shiloh,    1.6065767145351917
Ill&, had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs, who had    1.67495327387791
arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville, Ill&,    1.4513752902486308
and seized four operative weapons, including a Browning machine gun,    1.5636360329510388
two Browning automatic rifles and an ~M-4 rifle.   Undismayed    1.5127085093302464
by this contretemps, a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli's    1.6432600607208703
home at 6:30 A&M& the next day, put on their uniforms,    1.6065767145351917
and headed for a farm several miles away. A 60 mm& mortar and a    1.7026049541338664
57 mm&    1.0
recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along. The mortar    1.5636360329510388
was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated.   1.6065767145351917
After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War    1.6432600607208703
/2, army jeep down soggy trails, the band arrived at a small clearing    1.67495327387791
squeezed between a long, low ridge and a creek-filled gully. Here    1.6065767145351917
the two leaders, DePugh and Lauchli, hastened to put the group    1.6065767145351917
through its paces.   The Minutemen were instructed in the use    1.5636360329510388
of terrain for concealment. They were shown how to advance against an    1.6432600607208703
enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge. They practiced movement behind a    1.6065767145351917
smoke screen laid by smoke grenades; and they attempted a skirmish    1.6065767145351917
line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment. Eleven dummy    1.5636360329510388
rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar    1.6065767145351917
shooting.   Mrs& DePugh, the mother of five children and an    1.5636360329510388
active member of her husband's organization, participated in all the    1.5636360329510388
exercises.   There were no "casualties", but the "guerrillas"    1.4513752902486308
admitted to being "a little tired" when the leaders called    1.5636360329510388
a halt at 9 A&M& to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.    1.67495327387791
I would like to add one more practical reform    1.5127085093302464
to those mentioned by Russell Kirk [Dec& 16]. It has to do    1.6432600607208703
with teachers' salaries and tenure.   Next September, after receiving    1.5127085093302464
a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program,    1.5636360329510388
I will be teaching somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present    1.6432600607208703
shortage of mathematics teachers. I will also be underpaid. The    1.5636360329510388
amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers. Teaching    1.7026049541338664
is at present a sellers' market; as a result buyers, the    1.6065767145351917
public, must be satisfied with second-rate teachers. But this is not    1.6065767145351917
the real problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually    1.67495327387791
paid on the basis of time served rather than quality. Hence all    1.6432600607208703
teachers, good and bad, who have been teaching for a given number of    1.67495327387791
years are paid the same salary. I am firmly convinced that considering    1.6432600607208703
the average quality of teachers in this country, the profession is grossly    1.6432600607208703
overpaid.   It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect    1.5636360329510388
any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how much the public    1.67495327387791
will pay for shoddy performance. The only hope which good teachers    1.6065767145351917
have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight    1.67495327387791
of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them. The only hope which    1.67495327387791
the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis    1.7026049541338664
of merit rather than tenure. Here, as in all sectors of the economy,    1.67495327387791
quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual    1.6432600607208703
to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses. @    1.5636360329510388
On the eve of the "great debate" on the proposal    1.5636360329510388
to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions    1.6065767145351917
which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community,    1.5127085093302464
we should face the alternatives on this proposition. What we will    1.6065767145351917
be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be <selective>    1.67495327387791
which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which    1.5636360329510388
we now operate. Without this power we lay open any American industry    1.6432600607208703
which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy    1.5636360329510388
to the will of others. It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct    1.7269387314284994
our <economy> which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we    1.67495327387791
conduct our <political> affairs. @    1.0
I disagree with Mr& Burnham's position on the Common Market    1.5636360329510388
[Nov& 18] as a desirable organization for us to join. For him to    1.67495327387791
ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of    1.5636360329510388
this kind is difficult to understand. The pressure for our entry to    1.6432600607208703
the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated    1.6432600607208703
trade union by way of a purely "economic thoroughfare", or    1.5636360329510388
garden path, with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.    1.6065767145351917
The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing    1.7026049541338664
to those who do not see its relation to political and legal,    1.6432600607208703
as well as economic, self-rule. In entering this union we will be surrendering    1.67495327387791
most, if not all, of our economic autonomy to international    1.5636360329510388
bodies such as the Atlantic Institute (recently set up) or the O&E&C&D&,    1.6432600607208703
I&M&F& and others. To think that we can merely    1.5127085093302464
relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political    1.5127085093302464
or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.   If it is not enough that    1.6432600607208703
all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join    1.6065767145351917
this market, I refer you to an article in the <New York Times>'    1.67495327387791
magazine section [Nov& 12, 1961], by Mr& Eric Johnston,    1.5127085093302464
entitled "We Must Join the Common Market". He says: "It    1.5636360329510388
has swept aside petty nationalisms, age-old rivalries, and worn-out    1.5127085093302464
customs". Referring to Britain, he says, "We see a nation that    1.6065767145351917
traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its    1.6065767145351917
economy, placing this authority in Continental hands". **h Since    1.5127085093302464
the goal of our international planners is a World Government, this Atlantic    1.6432600607208703
Community would mark a giant step in that direction for, once    1.6065767145351917
American economic autonomy is absorbed, a larger grouping is a question    1.6065767145351917
of time. Frankly, it is being very cleverly done for, in a sense,    1.67495327387791
they have us over a barrel. Listen to what Mr& Johnston has to    1.67495327387791
say: "Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.    1.5127085093302464
**h We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports    1.6432600607208703
we need. We would be crippled by reduced output, industrial decline,    1.6065767145351917
widespread unemployment".   But the solution to this dilemma    1.4513752902486308
is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community    1.6432600607208703
or "economic empire", but merely what libertarians like Henry    1.5127085093302464
Hazlitt and Ludwig von Mises have been arguing for years: an    1.6065767145351917
end to government regulations, an end to government competition in industry,    1.6065767145351917
and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry. Create a    1.5127085093302464
free market here, give us a sound, debt-free money system, and we'll    1.6432600607208703
compete with anyone, Europe and Asia combined. In short, get this    1.6065767145351917
governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about    1.6432600607208703
European competition or Communism either. If we want to preserve    1.5636360329510388
our sovereignty, this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international    1.7026049541338664
planning board. If we go into this Common Market, we might    1.6065767145351917
just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees, Connally    1.5127085093302464

In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two    1.5127085093302464
years honorably on Active Duty I was not required to participate in    1.6432600607208703
any further Army Reserve activities. Now, more than five years later,    1.6065767145351917
I cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier. But,    1.6432600607208703
in spite of this, I, at present a man 31 years of age and a College    1.748515906000203
Professor, have been recalled "by direction of the President"    1.5127085093302464
to report on November 25th to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, for another    1.6065767145351917
twelve months of Active Duty as an ~Sp 4 (the equivalent of a    1.67495327387791
~PFC). Today, seven years after the date of my initial induction    1.6065767145351917
as a draftee, I am Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science    1.6065767145351917
at St& Michael's College. For, after leaving the Army in 1956,    1.6065767145351917
I spent five years in Graduate School first at Boston College    1.6065767145351917
and then at the University of Toronto. This time, added to that which    1.67495327387791
I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954, makes    1.67495327387791
a total of twenty-two (22) years of education.   The possibility    1.5636360329510388
of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American    1.7026049541338664
has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys. With    1.67495327387791
this no loyal citizen can quarrel. However, it seems axiomatic that    1.6065767145351917
the government has an obligation "to exercise its mandate reasonably,    1.5636360329510388
equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably    1.6065767145351917
causes". In my own case, I submit that such reasonable and fair    1.6432600607208703
exercise is woefully lacking. Taken back into the Army now as an    1.6432600607208703
~Sp 4, I am leaving 110 college students whose teacher I am. (A    1.67495327387791
wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from    1.67495327387791
the draft in order to attend my classes.) At this late date, it is    1.7026049541338664
impossible for St& Michael's College to find a suitable replacement    1.5636360329510388
for me. Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal    1.748515906000203
life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very    1.6432600607208703
compelling reason- I cannot help looking around at the black leather    1.6065767145351917

troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for    1.6065767145351917

fight for the United Nations? If the ~UN troops are not mercenaries    1.6432600607208703
then the Hessians were not mercenaries either. And if the foreigners    1.6065767145351917
fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette    1.5127085093302464

In the issue of March 5, 1960 you had an    1.5636360329510388
excellent editorial which said:   "On trial in Jakarta for    1.5127085093302464

pilot Alan Lawrence Pope boldly told the court that in supporting    1.6065767145351917
the freedom fighters, he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence    1.6065767145351917
of Indonesia. Facing a prosecution which has demanded the    1.5127085093302464
death penalty, he said: 'I have participated in the war against    1.6065767145351917
Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu, and I have helped in the evacuation    1.67495327387791
of North Vietnamese to the free world. I have done all this    1.6432600607208703
for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states    1.6432600607208703
which have been threatened by Communist domination'. At least in    1.5636360329510388
Indonesia, Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with    1.6432600607208703
Communism"!   Since then nothing has happened to save the    1.5127085093302464
life of Pope. I found recently a very small article in the <New    1.67495327387791

we see, Pope may appeal to President Sukarno, Khrushchev's friend,    1.5636360329510388
for clemency. This possibility is anything but reassuring.    1.4513752902486308

A few days before I saw your mention of what Texas    1.6065767145351917
Liberals were doing to promote "Louis Capet" ["The Week",    1.5127085093302464
June 3], another analogy had occurred to me.   Consider    1.5127085093302464
this table: _1._ Louis /14,- ~FDR. "**h With no strong    1.5636360329510388
men and no parliament to dispute his will, he <was> the government".    1.6432600607208703
_2._ Regency- Truman. "A 'dust-settling' period    1.2818970554302986
of decadence and decline". _3._ Louis /15,- Eisenhower.    1.4513752902486308
"**h he opened his mouth, said little, and thought not at all". _4._    1.67495327387791
Louis /16,- Kennedy. "**h not <completely> virtuous,    1.3761581156320553
but <completely> incompetent".   And Marie Antoinette- Jacqueline    1.3761581156320553
Bouvier. "**h the beautiful and light-hearted". _5._    1.3761581156320553
French Revolution- Conservative Revolution?   Truly,    1.1606783668269585
that Liberals should choose Louis /14, as a bogey-symbol of conservatism    1.6065767145351917
is grotesquely ironic, considering the Louis /14, character    1.4513752902486308
of their Grand Monarque, ~FDR: not only in his accretion of absolute    1.6432600607208703
power and personal deification, (<le roi gouverne par lui meme>),    1.5636360329510388
but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.   1.6065767145351917
In defeating "Louis Capet", John Tower's victory in    1.4513752902486308
Texas signals, once again, the end of the divine right of Liberalism.    1.6432600607208703
IT SEEMS TO ME that N&C&, in his editorial    1.5127085093302464
"Confrontation" [~SR, Mar& 25], has hit upon the real    1.5127085093302464
problem that bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain    1.7026049541338664
our personal relationship with those who suffer? This affects us    1.5636360329510388
all intimately, and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress.    1.67495327387791
I know of no other solution than the one N&C& proposes-    1.6065767145351917
to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us, hoping that    1.7026049541338664
this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place. Never    1.7026049541338664
have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically. @   1.5636360329510388

only hope is that it will be shared by many, many others. @   "CONFRONTATION"    1.67495327387791

for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the    1.6432600607208703
Peace Corps. I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have    1.6432600607208703
a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands. It would    1.6065767145351917
be heartbreaking to see idealism, and hence effective leadership, thwarted    1.5636360329510388
by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into.    1.6065767145351917
@   THE EDITORIAL "Confrontation" was certainly direct    1.2818970554302986
in its appear to those of us living here in America. I personally    1.67495327387791
gained strength from it. Thanks for continuing to capture the attention    1.6065767145351917
and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world. @   1.6065767145351917
N&C&'s EDITORIAL "Confrontation" is a stunning piece    1.3761581156320553
of writing. I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone    1.6065767145351917
entering the Peace Corps to read it. The important people to    1.6065767145351917
humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros **h but the Schweitzers    1.6432600607208703

members of the Peace Corps. A Peace Corps official described the    1.6065767145351917
editorial as "precisely the message we need to communicate to the    1.6065767145351917

F& L& LUCAS'S article in ~SR's    1.2818970554302986

New English Bible. I certainly hope this will be the impression left    1.6432600607208703
in the minds of readers, rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory    1.6432600607208703
in his FIRST OF THE MONTH column. It is blind, fundamentalist    1.6065767145351917
dogmatism to say, "Messing around with the King James version    1.5636360329510388

LESTER MARKEL is on the right track in his article "Interpretation    1.6065767145351917
of Interpretation"    1.0
[~SR, Mar& 11]. The current stereotype    1.2818970554302986
of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting    1.5127085093302464
the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored    1.6432600607208703
fact, fancy, and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished    1.5636360329510388
in this country more than a generation ago.   We don't    1.5636360329510388
need this type of protection any more. The public is now armed with    1.67495327387791
sophistication and numerous competing media. Besides, there are no    1.5127085093302464
longer enough corruptible journalists about.   The accepted method    1.4513752902486308
of writing news has two major liabilities. First, it does not communicate.    1.6432600607208703
A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements    1.4513752902486308
of both sides in a major labor dispute, for instance, is unable to tell    1.7026049541338664
his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute.    1.67495327387791
Second, it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous. The    1.6065767145351917
charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed    1.6065767145351917
innocent people but misled the nation. Yet the press was powerless    1.6065767145351917
to put these charges in perspective in its news columns. despite several    1.6432600607208703
years of front-page stories, the average citizen was unable to get    1.6065767145351917
a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen    1.6432600607208703
what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way    1.67495327387791
of communicating. The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.   1.6432600607208703
It seems to me the time has come for the American    1.6065767145351917
press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will    1.6432600607208703
do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by    1.7026049541338664
those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve    1.6432600607208703
their own ends. The objective should be to provide a method of getting    1.67495327387791
into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant    1.6432600607208703
information in the possession of reporters and editors. @    1.4513752902486308
I WOULD LIKE to see you devote    1.3761581156320553
some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President    1.6432600607208703
Kennedy's activities, so far as Southern California is concerned.    1.5127085093302464
You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised    1.67495327387791
press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent    1.6432600607208703
opinions.   To begin with, the all-powerful Los Angeles <Times>    1.5127085093302464
does not publish a transcript of these press conferences. I    1.5636360329510388
am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.   Next,    1.5636360329510388
because of the time differential, the conferences come on the networks    1.6065767145351917
during the middle of the day. Up until now, the networks have grudgingly    1.67495327387791
run half-hour tapes at 5 P&M& or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P&M&.    1.6432600607208703
Even then, a few of the "less interesting" questions are    1.5636360329510388
edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator. However, last night    1.6065767145351917
the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got    1.7269387314284994
on ~TV were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley    1.6065767145351917
and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs. This is no criticism    1.6065767145351917
of them, as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute    1.67495327387791
news summary.   The radio stations did run "transcripts"    1.4513752902486308
(I thought) during the evening hours. However, by comparing    1.5127085093302464
the ~TV snatches, two different radio station re-runs, and the censored    1.6065767145351917
Los Angeles <Times> version, I found that the radio stations    1.5636360329510388
had edited out questions (~ABC removed the one regarding Laos)    1.5636360329510388
or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer.    1.6432600607208703
I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country    1.7026049541338664
about the "abuse" he is being subjected to. We out here don't    1.6432600607208703
see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.   I don't    1.67495327387791
know if this is the situation in other parts of the country; apparently    1.67495327387791
it is not. It also happened with the Inauguration, which was    1.6065767145351917
not re-run at all during the evening hours, and I wrote to the ~TV    1.7026049541338664
editor of the <Times>. He did mention in his column the fact that    1.67495327387791
he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand    1.67495327387791
the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this-    1.5636360329510388
but nothing happened.   Can you bring the networks' attention    1.5127085093302464
to this? @    1.0
I WAS INTERESTED    1.0
in James Webb Young's MADISON AVENUE column in which    1.5127085093302464
he raised the question "Do We Need a College of Propaganda"?    1.6065767145351917
[~SR, Feb& 11].   In my estimation, we definitely    1.4513752902486308
do; and the sad part of it is that we had one, which was rounding into    1.748515906000203
excellent shape, and we let it disintegrate and die.   During    1.5636360329510388
the war, we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare,    1.6432600607208703
which included the teaching of propaganda, both black and white and the    1.6432600607208703
various shades of grey in between. We had a couple of schools in this    1.7026049541338664
country, the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out    1.6065767145351917
in Lloyd's Neck. There were also a couple in Canada, and several    1.6432600607208703
in England. The English schools preceded ours, and by the time we    1.6432600607208703
got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda    1.67495327387791
and its teaching.   Four of us here in the United States attended,    1.6432600607208703
first as students, then as instructors, almost every one of these    1.6065767145351917
schools, in England, Canada, and the United States. We set up    1.6065767145351917
the Lloyd's Neck school, worked out its curriculum, and taught there.    1.6065767145351917
Toward the end of the war, we really felt that we had learned something    1.7026049541338664
about propaganda and how to teach it.   When the end did    1.6065767145351917
come, and the schools were disbanded and abandoned, we felt and hoped    1.6432600607208703
that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.    1.6432600607208703
We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some    1.6432600607208703
sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year    1.6432600607208703
or so. Alas, no such thing happened. There apparently is no school of    1.67495327387791
propaganda or psychological warfare. A study at the Pentagon and at    1.6065767145351917
the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there. And    1.6065767145351917
not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been    1.7026049541338664
called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way. @   CONGRATULATIONS    1.6432600607208703
on the article "Do We Need a College of Propaganda"?    1.5636360329510388
This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this    1.6065767145351917
critical field in years, and I certainly hope it sparks some action.    1.6432600607208703
@    1.6432600607208703
MANY OF US in public    1.1606783668269585
relations were flattered that Richard L& Tobin chose to devote his    1.6065767145351917
editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger    1.5636360329510388
of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public    1.6065767145351917
Relations Association.    1.0
I WAS SURPRISED and sorry to find in your issue    1.5636360329510388
of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet    1.7269387314284994
been published.   Whether in his forthcoming book C& P& Snow    1.5636360329510388
commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily    1.6432600607208703
autobiographical critic charged him is important. One should be able    1.5636360329510388
to get hold of the book at once. But the attack was made from an advance    1.748515906000203
copy. If this practice should take root and spread, the man who    1.6432600607208703
submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before    1.6065767145351917
he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality.    1.6432600607208703
@   EDITOR'S NOTE: <Sir Robert Watson-Watt    1.1606783668269585
wrote, on page 50 of> ~SR/ <Research for 4 March 1961: "I    1.6432600607208703
have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled, 'Science    1.7269387314284994
and Government'. Until the work actually appears I am    1.5127085093302464
not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail. But I have compared    1.6432600607208703
its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin    1.6432600607208703
lectures at Harvard, from which the book was derived, and I can    1.6432600607208703
with confidence challenge the gist of C& P& Snow's incautious    1.5636360329510388
tale".   Watson-Watt's remarks in> ~SR <did not then,    1.4513752902486308
constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures.    1.67495327387791
Representatives of Harvard University Press, which is publishing    1.4513752902486308
the book this month of April, recognize and freely acknowledge    1.5636360329510388
that they invited such reaction by allowing> Life <magazine to print    1.6065767145351917
an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date.    1.6432600607208703
The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the    1.6432600607208703
SIR ROBERT WATSON-WATT'S "rebuttal"    1.0
of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout    1.5127085093302464
by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself    1.6065767145351917
from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those "falsehoods"    1.5127085093302464
in an unclear incoherent argument.   The article    1.3761581156320553
presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning. It calls the    1.6432600607208703
conclusion admitted valid by "historians and military strategists alike"    1.5127085093302464
a "perverted conclusion. **h nonsense".   It submits    1.3761581156320553
an enthusiastic, impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing    1.3761581156320553
another aspect of the man, but on no more authoritative basis than Sir    1.67495327387791
Charles' account. We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.   1.6065767145351917
The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the    1.6432600607208703
result of the tea party. But we are to believe that Lindemann actively    1.67495327387791
supported radar outside the Tizard Committee, and dissembling,    1.4513752902486308
discounted it inside? If so, I would lean to Sir Charles' conception    1.6432600607208703
of the man.   I think it was a grave error to print the    1.67495327387791
article at this time. To the unfortunate people unable to attend the    1.6432600607208703
Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the    1.6065767145351917
book which may dissuade some people from reading it. @   1.5127085093302464
IT IS NOT NEWS that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the    1.6432600607208703
violin. Certainly not in Orchestra hall where he has played countless    1.6065767145351917
recitals, and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with    1.6065767145351917
the Chicago Symphony orchestra, playing the Brahms Concerto with    1.5127085093302464
his own slashing, demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high, pale,    1.5636360329510388
pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music,    1.7026049541338664
or forever finds it closed.   There was about that song something    1.6065767145351917
incandescent, for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat. Not    1.5636360329510388
the noblest performance we have heard him play, or the most spacious,    1.6432600607208703
or even the most eloquent. Those would be reserved for the orchestra's    1.6432600607208703
great nights when the soloist can surpass himself. This time the    1.6065767145351917
orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own    1.6432600607208703
high mood. But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only    1.67495327387791
up to a point.   That is, when Mr& Milstein thrust straight    1.6065767145351917
to the core of the music, sparks flying, bow shredding, violin singing,    1.6432600607208703
glittering and sometimes spitting, Mr& Hendl could go along. But    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Hendl does not go straight to any point. He flounders and    1.6432600607208703
lets music sprawl. There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and    1.67495327387791
marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist, orchestra    1.6065767145351917
and music to ultimate fusion. So we had some dazzling and memorable    1.6432600607208703
Milstein, but not great Brahms.   The concert opened with    1.5127085093302464
another big romantic score, Schumann's Overture to "Manfred",    1.4513752902486308
which suffered fate, this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic    1.6065767145351917
point to keep it afloat. Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was    1.6065767145351917
a considerably more serious misfortune, for it demands transluscent    1.5127085093302464
textures, buoyant rhythms, and astringent wit. It got the kind of scrambled,    1.6432600607208703
coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when    1.5636360329510388
the man with the baton lacks technique and style.    1.5127085093302464
The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production    1.5636360329510388
of "Tannhaeuser" staged by Wieland Wagner, who is doing all the    1.6065767145351917
operas this time, and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch. Sawalisch    1.5127085093302464
also conducts "The Flying Dutch", opening July 24. "Parsifal"    1.5127085093302464
follows July 25, with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting, and he    1.5127085093302464
also conducts "Die Meistersinger", to be presented Aug& 8 and    1.5636360329510388

Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano, Grace Bumbry, will    1.6065767145351917

REMEMBER HOW BY a series of booking absurdities Chicago    1.5127085093302464
missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet? Remember how by lack of two big    1.6432600607208703
theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet?    1.6065767145351917
Well, now we have two big theaters. But barring a miracle, and    1.6432600607208703
don't hold your breath for it, Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov    1.6432600607208703
Ballet, which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and    1.6065767145351917
is one of the great companies of the world.   Before you let    1.6432600607208703
loose a howl saying we announced its coming, not once but several times,    1.67495327387791
indeed we did. The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big    1.7026049541338664
theater in McCormick Place, which Sol Hurok, ballet booker extraordinary,    1.5636360329510388
considers the finest house of its kind in the country- and    1.6065767145351917
It    1.0
was all set. Allied Arts corporation first listed the Chicago dates    1.6065767145351917
as Dec& 4 thru 10. Later the Hurok office made it Dec& 8 thru    1.7026049541338664
17, a nice, long booking for the full repertory. But if you keep a calendar    1.7269387314284994
of events, as we do, you noticed a conflict. Allied Arts had    1.6432600607208703
booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec& 8 and 9. Something    1.6065767145351917
had to give. Not La Dietrich. Allied Arts then notified    1.5636360329510388
us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking, fly here    1.67495327387791
to open Nov& 28, and close Dec& 2. Shorter booking, but still    1.6432600607208703
a booking. We printed it.   A couple of days later a balletomane    1.6432600607208703
told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was    1.6432600607208703
told "the newspapers had made a mistake". So I started making    1.6065767145351917
The Kirov Ballet    1.0
is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, Nov&    1.5636360329510388
21 thru Dec& 4. Not a chance of opening here Nov& 28-    1.6432600607208703
barring that miracle. Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held    1.6432600607208703
for us? Well, Dietrich won't budge from McCormick Place. Then    1.5636360329510388
how about the Civic Opera house? Well, Allied Arts has booked    1.6065767145351917
Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec& 4.   Queried about    1.6065767145351917
the impasse, Allied Arts said: "Better cancel the Kirov for    1.5636360329510388
the time being. It's all up in the air again".   So the Kirov    1.67495327387791
will fly back to Russia, minus a Chicago engagement, a serious    1.6065767145351917
loss for dance fans- and for the frustrated bookers, cancellation of    1.6065767145351917
one of the richest bookings in the country.   Will somebody please    1.6065767145351917
reopen the Auditorium?   1.0

H E& BATES has scribbled a farce called "Hark, Hark,    1.5636360329510388
the Lark"! It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible    1.6065767145351917
novels of the season.   If there is a moral lurking among the    1.6432600607208703
shenanigans, it is hard to find. Perhaps the lesson we should take from    1.67495327387791
these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild    1.6432600607208703
scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics.   Anyway, a number of    1.6065767145351917
them meet here in devastating collisions. One is an imperial London    1.6065767145351917
stockbroker called Jerebohm. Another is a wily countryman called Larkin,    1.5636360329510388
whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled, I believe,    1.5127085093302464
in earlier volumes of Mr& Bates' comedie humaine.   What's    1.5127085093302464
up now? Well, Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the    1.6065767145351917
stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive    1.6432600607208703
rustic simplicities.   They want to own a junior-grade castle,    1.5127085093302464
or a manor house, or some modest little place where Shakespeare might    1.6432600607208703
once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded    1.6432600607208703
courtiers.   They are willing to settle, however, in anything    1.5127085093302464
that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at. And of course    1.7026049541338664
Larkin has just the thing they want.    1.3761581156320553
It's a horror. The name of it is Gore Court, and it is surrounded    1.7026049541338664
by a wasteland that would impress T& S& Eliot. That's not    1.6065767145351917
precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it, though. He conjures    1.67495327387791
herds    1.0
of deer, and wild birds crowding the air.   He suggests    1.5636360329510388
that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor. The stained-glass    1.6432600607208703
windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas, the paneling    1.4513752902486308
may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform.    1.6432600607208703
The vast, dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions    1.6432600607208703
when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch.   1.6065767145351917
Larkin has an answer to all that. The spaciousness of the Tudor    1.6432600607208703
cooking areas, for example, will provide needed space for the extra    1.6065767145351917
television sets required by modern butlers, cooks and maids. Also, perhaps,    1.6065767145351917
table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented.   1.6065767145351917
It's a wonder, really, to how much mendacious trouble    1.5127085093302464
Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse.    1.5636360329510388
He doesn't really need the immense sum of money (probably converted    1.6065767145351917
from American gold on the London Exchange) he makes them pay.   1.6065767145351917
For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot. He has    1.6065767145351917
a glorious wife and many children. When he needs money to buy something    1.67495327387791
like, say, the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch, he    1.6065767145351917
takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies. One of those capital-gains    1.7026049541338664
ventures, in fact, has saddled him with Gore Court. He is    1.6065767145351917
willing to sell it just to get it off his hands.   And the Jerebohms    1.7026049541338664
are more than willing to buy it. They plan to become county people    1.67495327387791
who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth.    1.6432600607208703
If, in Larkin's eyes, they are nothing    1.3761581156320553
but Piccadilly farmers, he has as much to learn about them as they    1.67495327387791
have to learn about the ways of truly rural living.   Mr& Bates    1.6432600607208703
shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc. Oneupmanship    1.6065767145351917
is practiced by both sides in a total war.   First    1.5636360329510388
the Larkins are ahead, then the Jerebohms. After Larkin has been persuaded    1.6432600607208703
to restock his tangled acres with pheasants, he poaches only what    1.6065767145351917
he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers. One    1.6432600607208703
of the local callers, a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's    1.6432600607208703
tales of India, does not approve of the way Larkin gets    1.6065767145351917
his birds.   He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair    1.6432600607208703
on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance    1.7269387314284994
is entirely sporting. But the brigadier dines on the birds with    1.6065767145351917
relish.   1.0
IT is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive    1.6432600607208703
film yet made from Miguel de Cervantes' "Don Quixote"    1.5127085093302464
is the brilliant Russian spectacle, done in wide screen and color,    1.6065767145351917
which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street    1.5636360329510388
Playhouses.   More than a beautiful visualization of the    1.4513752902486308
illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant    1.4513752902486308
and his squire, Sancho Panza, in seventeenth-century Spain, this inevitably    1.5636360329510388
abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an    1.5636360329510388
Nikolai    1.0
Cherkasov, the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander    1.6432600607208703
Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible, performs the lanky Don Quixote,    1.5636360329510388
and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility    1.6432600607208703
and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.   His addle-brained    1.5636360329510388
knight-errant, self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an    1.4513752902486308
age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous    1.6432600607208703
code of knight-errantry had become a joke, is, as Cervantes no doubt    1.6432600607208703
intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely    1.6432600607208703
in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.   Cherkasov    1.5127085093302464
does not caricature him, as some actors have been inclined to do. He    1.67495327387791
treats this deep-eyed, bearded, bony crackpot with tangible affection    1.5127085093302464
and respect. Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is    1.6065767145351917
studiously    1.0
slow, he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and    1.6432600607208703
passing gravely through an impious world.   The complexities    1.4513752902486308
of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately    1.6065767145351917
stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in    1.5127085093302464
place of the Russian dialogue. The voices of all the characters, including    1.6432600607208703
that of Cherkasov, have richness, roughness or color to conform    1.5636360329510388
with the personalities. And the subtleties of the dialogue are most    1.6065767145351917
helpfully conveyed. Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish,    1.5636360329510388
there is no violation of artistry or logic here.   Splendid,    1.5636360329510388
too, is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev, one of Russia's leading    1.6065767145351917
comedians, as Sancho Panza, the fat, grotesque "squire". Though    1.5127085093302464
his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don,    1.6065767145351917
he gives it a firmness and toughness- a sort of peasant dignity-    1.6432600607208703
too. It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character    1.67495327387791
the    1.0
oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons.   1.4513752902486308
The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played    1.6432600607208703
on him when he is facetiously put in command of an "island" is    1.67495327387791
True, the pattern and flow of    1.2818970554302986
the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in    1.6432600607208703
the first half, before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court. But    1.6432600607208703
strength and poignancy develop thenceforth, and the windmill and deathbed    1.5636360329510388
episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of    1.5636360329510388
the old boy.   There are other good representations of peasants    1.5636360329510388
and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently    1.67495327387791
photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this    1.6065767145351917
country in the program of joint cultural exchange.   Also on the    1.6065767145351917
bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called    1.6432600607208703
"Sunday in Greenwich Village", a tour of the haunts and joints.   1.6065767145351917
Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz,    1.6065767145351917
which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member    1.7269387314284994
of the family.   There seems to be an unfortunate assumption    1.5636360329510388
that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time, for example,    1.6432600607208703
could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary.    1.6065767145351917
At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for "Chicago    1.6065767145351917
and All That Jazz", presented on ~NBC-~TV Nov&    1.4513752902486308
26.   The program came out of the ~NBC Special Projects department,    1.6065767145351917
and was slotted in the Du Pont Show of the Week series.    1.6432600607208703
Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines.    1.4513752902486308
If so, it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different    1.748515906000203
department- one with enough confidence in the musical material    1.5127085093302464
to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room    1.7026049541338664
to display their talents.   As a matter of fact, this latter approach    1.6432600607208703
has already been tried, and with pleasing results. A few years    1.6065767145351917
ago a    1.0
"Timex All-Star Jazz Show" offered a broad range of styles,    1.5636360329510388
ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling    1.5127085093302464
Dukes of Dixieland. An enthusiastic audience confirmed the "live"    1.5127085093302464
character of the hour, and provided the interaction between musician    1.5636360329510388
and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance.   1.6432600607208703
About that same time John Crosby's ~TV series    1.4513752902486308
on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space    1.6432600607208703
is one of the most sensible things a producer can do. In an hour remembered    1.7269387314284994
for its almost rudderless movement, a score of jazz luminaries    1.5636360329510388
went before the cameras for lengthy periods. The program had been arranged    1.6432600607208703
to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration    1.5636360329510388
on the music. Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups,    1.6065767145351917
then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work.   1.5636360329510388
"Chicago and All That Jazz" could not be faulted on the choice    1.6432600607208703
of artists. Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden,    1.5636360329510388
Gene Krupa, Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, Johnny St& Cyr,    1.5636360329510388
Joe Sullivan, Red Allen, Lil Armstrong, Blossom Seeley. The    1.5127085093302464
jazz buff could hardly ask for more.   Furthermore, Garry Moore    1.5636360329510388
makes an ideal master of ceremonies. (He played host at the Timex    1.6432600607208703
show already mentioned.)   One of the script's big problems    1.5127085093302464
was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances    1.67495327387791
by musicians of today. ~NBC had gathered a lot of historical material    1.6432600607208703
which it was eager to share. For example, there was sheet music    1.6432600607208703
with the word "jazz" in the title,    1.3761581156320553
to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold. Samples    1.6065767145351917
soomed into closeup range in regular succession, like telephone poles    1.5636360329510388
passing on the highway, while representative music reinforced the mood    1.5636360329510388
of the late teens and 1920's.   However well chosen and cleverly    1.6065767145351917
arranged, such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an    1.5127085093302464
interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business, which    1.5636360329510388
(considering the talent at hand) should probably have been the gathering    1.6065767145351917
of fresh samples of the Chicago style.   Another source of    1.5636360329510388
~NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke, but this    1.6432600607208703
view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would    1.7026049541338664
have blotted out the entire glimpse. Similarly, in presenting still    1.5636360329510388
photographs of early jazz groups, the program allowed no time for a    1.6432600607208703
close perusal.   "Chicago and All That Jazz" may have wound    1.5636360329510388
up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer.    1.5636360329510388
By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase    1.7269387314284994
for today's artists, the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect    1.6065767145351917
example of either. Still, the network's willingness to experiment    1.5127085093302464
in this musical field is to be commended, and future essays happily    1.6432600607208703
anticipated.   1.0
Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous    1.5127085093302464
reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending    1.5127085093302464
her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" Sunday    1.5636360329510388
night.   The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of    1.6065767145351917
cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland    1.6065767145351917
took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic "Mad    1.5636360329510388
Scene" created on her own and with the help of the composer and the    1.7026049541338664
other performers.   Her entrance in Scene 2, Act 1, brought some    1.6065767145351917
disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note. Thereafter    1.5636360329510388
the audience waxed applause-happy, but discriminating operagoers reserved    1.4513752902486308
judgment as her singing showed signs of strain, her musicianship    1.5636360329510388
some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization.    1.4513752902486308
As she gained composure during the second act, her technical resourcefulness    1.6065767145351917
emerged stronger, though she had already revealed a trill almost    1.5636360329510388
unprecedented in years of performances of "Lucia". She topped    1.5127085093302464
the sextet brilliantly.   Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy    1.6065767145351917
so that it stopped the show midway in the "Mad Scene", but the    1.67495327387791
real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding    1.5636360329510388
at the moment. Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person    1.5636360329510388
in this scene: A much more girlish Lucia, a sensational coloratura    1.6065767145351917
who ran across stage while singing, and an actress immersed in her    1.6432600607208703
role. What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as    1.5636360329510388
Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among    1.6065767145351917
sopranos today.   This big, flexible voice with uncommon range    1.5127085093302464
has been superbly disciplined. Nervousness at the start must have caused    1.6065767145351917
the blemishes of her first scene, or she may warm up slowly. In    1.67495327387791
the fullness of her vocal splendor, however, she could sing the famous    1.6432600607208703
scene magnificently.   Technically it was fascinating, aurally    1.3761581156320553
spell-binding, and dramatically quite realistic. Many years have passed    1.5127085093302464
since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable. Her debut    1.5127085093302464
over, perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine.   The    1.5636360329510388
performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor,    1.6065767145351917
Silvio Varviso. He injected more vitality into the score than    1.5636360329510388
it has revealed in many years. He may respect too much the Italian tradition    1.7026049541338664
of letting singers hold on to their notes, but to restrain them    1.6432600607208703
in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.   Richard Tucker    1.5636360329510388
sang Edgardo in glorious voice. His bel canto style gave the performance    1.6432600607208703
a special distinction. The remainder of the cast fulfilled its    1.5636360329510388
assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and    1.6065767145351917
limited stage direction proved only serviceable.   Miss Sutherland    1.4513752902486308
first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959. (The first Metropolitan    1.6065767145351917
Opera broadcast on Dec& 9 will introduce her as Lucia.)    1.5636360329510388
She    1.0
has since turned to Bellini, whose opera "Beatrice di Tenda"    1.5636360329510388
in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her    1.6065767145351917
to New York last season. She will sing "La Sonambula" with    1.6065767145351917
it here next week.   1.0
Anyone for musical Ping-pong?   It's really quite fun-    1.4513752902486308
as long as you like games. You will need a stereo music system,    1.67495327387791
with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart, and    1.6432600607208703
one or more of the new London "Phase 4" records. There are 12    1.67495327387791
of these to choose from, all of them of popular music except for the    1.7026049541338664
star release, {Pass in Review} (~SP-44001). This features    1.4513752902486308
the marching songs of several nations, recorded as though the various    1.6065767145351917
national bands were marching by your reviewing stand. Complete with    1.5636360329510388
crowd effects, interruptions by jet planes, and sundry other touches of    1.6065767145351917
realism, this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect.   1.6065767145351917
All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed    1.5636360329510388
explanation of this new recording program. No reference is made to the    1.6432600607208703
possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner, and    1.6065767145351917
it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music. Directionality    1.6432600607208703
is greatly exaggerated most of the time; but when the sounds of    1.6432600607208703
the two speakers are allowed to mix, there is excellent depth and dimension    1.67495327387791
to the music. You definitely hear some of the instruments close    1.6065767145351917
up and others farther back, with the difference in placement apparently    1.6065767145351917
more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely    1.5636360329510388
being louder than the ones farther back. This is a characteristic of    1.6432600607208703
good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural    1.6065767145351917
sound.   London explains that the very distinct directional    1.4513752902486308
effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods    1.7269387314284994
of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape    1.6432600607208703
channels. These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active    1.6432600607208703
co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two    1.6065767145351917
channels which are impressed on the record. In some of the numbers    1.6432600607208703
the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and    1.6065767145351917
then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects.   1.6065767145351917
Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs    1.6065767145351917
may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include    1.7026049541338664
the word "percussion" or "percussive". Drums, xylophones,    1.3761581156320553
castanets, and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably    1.4513752902486308
well. Only too often, however, you have the feeling that you are sitting    1.67495327387791
in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your    1.7269387314284994
left and others facing them on the wall to your right. They are definitely    1.7026049541338664
in the same room with you, but your head starts to swing as    1.67495327387791
though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a    1.7026049541338664
spirited volley.   {The Percussive Twenties} (~SP-44006)    1.2818970554302986
stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day, and Johnny    1.6065767145351917
Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in {Percussive    1.5127085093302464
Moods} (~SP-44005). {Big Band Percussion} (~SP-44002)    1.2818970554302986
seemed one of the least attractive discs- the arrangements just    1.5636360329510388
didn't have so much character as the others.   There is an extraordinary    1.6432600607208703
sense of presence in all of these recordings, apparently obtained    1.5636360329510388
at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies.    1.6065767145351917
The penalty for this is noticeable in the big, bold, brilliant,    1.6065767145351917
but brassy piano sounds in {Melody and Percussion for Two Pianos}    1.6065767145351917
(~SP-44007). All of the releases, however, are recorded at a    1.5636360329510388
gratifyingly high level, with resultant masking of any surface noise.    1.5636360329510388
{Pass in Review} practically guarantees enjoyment, and is a dramatic    1.5636360329510388
demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system.   1.5127085093302464
Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic, but not    1.5636360329510388
realistic.   Strange, but true- authenticity and realism often    1.4513752902486308
aren't related at all.   Almost every film bearing the imprimatur    1.5636360329510388
of Hollywood is physically authentic- in fact, impeccably so. In    1.5636360329510388
any given period piece the costumes, bric-a-brac, vehicles, and decor,    1.5636360329510388
bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity.   The major studios    1.5127085093302464
maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who    1.5636360329510388
look to this matter. During the making recently of an important Biblical    1.6432600607208703
film, some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only    1.6065767145351917
of costumes and interiors, but of architectural developments, sports    1.5127085093302464
arenas, vehicles, and other paraphernalia were compiled, consulted, and    1.5127085093302464
complied with.   But, alas, the authenticity seems to stop at    1.5636360329510388
the set's edge. The drama itself- and this seems to be lavishly true    1.67495327387791
of Biblical drama- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity    1.5636360329510388
at all. The storyline, in sort, is wildly unrealistic.    1.5127085093302464
Thus, in "The Story of Ruth" we have Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz    1.6432600607208703
and sets that are meticulously authentic. But except for a vague adherence    1.6432600607208703
to the basic storyline- i&e&, that Ruth remained with Naomi    1.5636360329510388
and finally wound up with Boaz- the film version has little to    1.6432600607208703
do with the Bible.   And in the new "King of Kings" the    1.6432600607208703
plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to    1.6432600607208703
the Gospels.   Earlier this month Edward R& Murrow, director    1.5127085093302464
of the United States Information Agency, came to Hollywood and    1.5636360329510388
had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry.   1.6432600607208703
He talked about unauthentic storylines too. He intimated that    1.5127085093302464
they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War. And    1.6432600607208703
to an industry that prides itself on authenticity, he urged greater realism.   1.6432600607208703
"in many corners of the globe", he said, "the major    1.5636360329510388
source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet.    1.6432600607208703
Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga    1.6065767145351917
of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge? Yet for    1.6432600607208703
much of the globe, Hollywood is just that- prime, if not sole, source    1.67495327387791
of knowledge. If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge    1.6432600607208703
our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone, what conclusions    1.6065767145351917
do you think he might come to?   1.3761581156320553
Francois D'Albert, Hungarian-born violinist who made his    1.3761581156320553
New York debut three years ago, played a return engagement last night    1.6432600607208703
in Judson Hall. He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory    1.6065767145351917
College. His pianist was Donald Jenni, a faculty member at DePaul    1.6065767145351917
University.   The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged    1.5636360329510388
by the artists, so that for the first half of the program, when    1.67495327387791
the    1.0
piano was partially open, Mr& Jenni's playing was too loud. In    1.6065767145351917
vying with him, Mr& D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his    1.6065767145351917
tone.   This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the    1.6065767145351917
performances, however, except in the case of the opening work, Mozart's    1.6065767145351917
Sonata in ~A (K& 526), which clattered along noisily in    1.5636360329510388
an unrelieved fashion.   Brahm's Sonata in ~A, although also    1.5127085093302464
vigorous, stood up well under the two artists' strong, large-scale    1.5636360329510388
treatment. Mr& D'Albert has a firm, attractive tone, which eschews    1.5636360329510388
an overly sweet vibrato. He made the most of the long Brahmsian    1.6432600607208703
phrases, and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work    1.67495327387791
a handsome performance.   A Sonata for Violin and Piano, called    1.5636360329510388
"Bella Bella", by Robert Fleming, was given its first United    1.5636360329510388
States performance. The title refers to the nickname given his    1.5636360329510388
wife by the composer, who is also a member of the National Film Board    1.7026049541338664
of Canada. The work's two movements, one melodically sentimental,    1.5127085093302464
the other brightly capricious, are clever enough in a Ravel-like    1.5636360329510388
style, but they rehash a wornout idiom. They might well indicate conjugal    1.6432600607208703
felicity, but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood.   Works    1.5636360329510388
by Dohnanyi, Hubay, Mr& D'Albert himself and Paganini,    1.4513752902486308
indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve    1.6065767145351917
as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase. Standard items    1.6432600607208703
by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program. @   1.3761581156320553
IN recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York    1.6065767145351917
Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium, but her program last night    1.5636360329510388
at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist's first New York recital    1.6065767145351917
since 1948.   Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard,    1.6065767145351917
and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the    1.67495327387791
authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control. And the    1.6065767145351917
tone she commands is always beautiful in sound.   Since she also    1.6065767145351917
has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the    1.6065767145351917
romantic tradition, Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure.    1.6432600607208703
She played with style and a touch of the grand manner, and every    1.67495327387791
piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures.   1.5636360329510388
The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers    1.6065767145351917
of this century. It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best.    1.7026049541338664
The Rachmaninoff Prelude No& 12, Op& 32, for instance, gave    1.5636360329510388
her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities- the    1.6065767145351917
ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them    1.5636360329510388
simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.   The    1.5127085093302464
four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured, rich in color and songful.    1.6065767145351917
And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism    1.5636360329510388
and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs.   Miss    1.3761581156320553
Xydis'    1.0
earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses, in which    1.4513752902486308
each variation was nicely set off from the others; Haydn's Sonata    1.6065767145351917
in ~E minor, which was unfailingly pleasant in sound, and Chopin's    1.6065767145351917
Sonata in ~B flat minor. A memory lapse in the last somewhat    1.6432600607208703
marred the pianist's performance. So what was the deepest music    1.5636360329510388
on her program had the poorest showing. Miss Xydis was best when    1.6432600607208703
she did not need to be too probing.   1.4513752902486308
ALL the generals who held important commands in World War    1.5636360329510388
/2, did not write books. It only seems as if they did. And the    1.7026049541338664
best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written. One    1.6432600607208703
of the very best is only now published in this country, five years    1.67495327387791
after its first publication in England. It is "Defeat Into Victory",    1.6065767145351917
by Field Marshal Viscount Slim.   A long book heavily    1.5127085093302464
weighted with military technicalities, in this edition it is neither    1.5636360329510388
so long nor so technical as it was originally. Field Marshal Slim    1.6432600607208703
has abridged it for the benefit of "those who, finding not so great    1.67495327387791
an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves, are more    1.6065767145351917
interested in men and their reactions to stress, hardship and danger".    1.6065767145351917
The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is, of    1.6432600607208703
course, the Field Marshal himself.   William Joseph Slim,    1.4513752902486308
First Viscount Slim, former Governor General of Australia, was the    1.5636360329510388
principal British commander in the field during the Burma War. He    1.6065767145351917
had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat    1.6065767145351917
of 1942 when the ill-prepared, ill-equipped British forces "were outmaneuvered,    1.5636360329510388
outfought and outgeneraled". He returned in command of    1.4513752902486308
an international army of Gurkhas, Indians, Africans, Chinese and    1.5127085093302464
British. And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles    1.6432600607208703
and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most    1.7269387314284994
brilliant campaigns of the war. "The Forgotten War" his soldiers    1.5636360329510388
called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe    1.6065767145351917
enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines.   Parts of "Defeat    1.5636360329510388
Into Victory" are a tangle of Burmese place names and military    1.6065767145351917
units, but a little application makes everything clear enough. On    1.5636360329510388
the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book.    1.5636360329510388
Field Marshal Slim is striking in description, amusing in many anecdotes.    1.6065767145351917
He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit    1.67495327387791
mistakes and even "a cardinal error". He praises many individuals    1.5636360329510388
generously. He himself seems to be tough, tireless, able and intelligent,    1.6065767145351917
more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers.    1.3761581156320553
"Defeat Into Victory" is a dramatic    1.2818970554302986
and lively military narrative. But it is most interesting in its account    1.6432600607208703
of the unending problems of high command, of decisions and their    1.6065767145351917
reasons, of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle    1.6432600607208703
action.   Before he could return to Burma, Field Marshal    1.5127085093302464
Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite    1.67495327387791
them with fresh recruits. His remarks about training, discipline,    1.5127085093302464
morale, leadership and command are enlightening. He believed in making    1.5636360329510388
inspiring speeches and he made a great many. He believed in being    1.6432600607208703
seen near the front lines and he was there. For general morale reasons    1.67495327387791
and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers, when food was    1.6432600607208703
short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly.   1.67495327387791
Other crucial matters required constant supervision:    1.2818970554302986
labor and all noncombatant troops, whose morale was vital, too;    1.5636360329510388
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with    1.3761581156320553
Top Brass- British, American and Chinese; health, hygiene, medical    1.5127085093302464
aid and preventive medicine; hospitals (inadequate) and nurses    1.4513752902486308
(scanty); food and military supplies; logistics and transport;    1.4513752902486308
airdrops and airstrips; roads and river barges to be built.    1.5636360329510388
Commenting on these and other matters, Field    1.3761581156320553
Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks:   "When    1.5127085093302464
in doubt as to two courses of action, a general should choose the    1.67495327387791
bolder".   "The commander has failed in <his> duty if he    1.5636360329510388
has not won victory- for that <is> his duty".   "It only    1.6065767145351917
does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which    1.6432600607208703
others may have but which you cannot give them. It depresses them. So    1.67495327387791
I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some    1.7026049541338664
of it".   Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage    1.6065767145351917
of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders.    1.6432600607208703
Of the Japanese private he says: "He fought and marched till    1.6065767145351917
he died. If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position, we had to    1.7026049541338664
kill 495 before it was ours- and then the last five killed themselves".   1.67495327387791
Brooding about future wars, the Field Marshal has this    1.5127085093302464
to say: "The Asian fighting man is at least equally brave [as    1.6432600607208703
the white], usually more careless of death, less encumbered by mental    1.6065767145351917
doubts, less troubled by humanitarian sentiment, and not so moved by    1.6065767145351917
slaughter and mutilation around him. He is, by background and living    1.6065767145351917
standards, better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly, to demand    1.5127085093302464
less in the way of subsistence or comfort, and to look after himself    1.67495327387791
when thrown on his own resources".   1.2818970554302986
A bunch of young buckaroos from out West, who go by the name    1.67495327387791
of Texas Boys Choir, loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded    1.6432600607208703
in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience.   Actually, the    1.5636360329510388
program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded,    1.5636360329510388
and they sang it beautifully. Under the capable direction of the choir's    1.6432600607208703
founder, Geroge Bragg, the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds    1.5636360329510388
in an opening group of Renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets,    1.6065767145351917
excerpts from Pergolesi's "Stabat Mater" and all of the    1.5127085093302464
Britten "Ceremonial of Carols".   Their singing was well-balanced,    1.4513752902486308
clear and, within obvious limitations, extremely pleasing. The    1.4513752902486308
limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices-    1.5636360329510388
an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity, an occasional    1.5127085093302464
waver and now and then a bleat.   But Mr& Bragg is    1.6065767145351917
a remarkably gifted conductor, and the results he has produced with    1.6065767145351917
his boys are generally superior. Most surprising of all, he has accomplished    1.6432600607208703
some prodigies in training for the production of words. The Latin,    1.6065767145351917
for example, was not only clear; it was even beautiful.   1.5636360329510388
Furthermore, there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation    1.5127085093302464
of the music. Lines came out neatly and in good balance. Tempos were    1.67495327387791
lively. The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish.   1.5127085093302464
A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and    1.6432600607208703
a few other passages enchantingly. Other capable soloists included    1.5127085093302464
David Clifton, Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson.   The final    1.5127085093302464
group included folk songs from back home, stomped out, shouted and    1.6065767145351917
chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume. Boys will be    1.6065767145351917
boys, and Texans will be Texans. The combination proved quite irresistible    1.6065767145351917
last night. @   1.0
THE Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze, after    1.5127085093302464
the region of Poland, where it has its headquarters, opened a three-week    1.6432600607208703
engagement at the City Center last night. A thoroughly ingratiating    1.5636360329510388
company it is, and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly    1.6432600607208703
realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all    1.7026049541338664
evening.   Not that it is all funny, by any means, though some    1.6432600607208703
of it is definitely so, but simply that the dancers are young and handsome,    1.7026049541338664
high-spirited and communicative, and the program itself is as vivacious    1.5636360329510388
as it is varied. There is no use at all in trying to follow    1.7026049541338664
it dance by dance and title by title, for it has a kind of nonstop format,    1.748515906000203
and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses    1.6065767145351917
for identification.   The material is all basically of folk origin,    1.5636360329510388
gleaned from every section of Poland. But under the direction of    1.6065767145351917
Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska, who with her late husband founded the    1.5127085093302464
organization in 1948, it has all been put into theatrical form, treated    1.6432600607208703
selectively, choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators,    1.3761581156320553
and performed altogether professionally. Under the surface of the    1.5127085093302464
wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training,    1.6432600607208703
Since    1.0
the organization was created thirteen years ago, it is obvious that    1.6065767145351917
this is not the original company; it is more likely the sons and daughters    1.7026049541338664
of that company. The girls are charming children and the men    1.6065767145351917
are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters. The stage is constantly    1.5636360329510388
full of them; indeed, there are never fewer than eight of them on    1.67495327387791
stage, and that is only for the more intimate numbers. They can be exuberant    1.7026049541338664
or sentimental, flirtatious or funny, but the only thing they    1.5636360329510388
seem unable to be is dull.   To pick out particular numbers is    1.6432600607208703
something of a problem, but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously    1.67495327387791
excellent to be missed. There is for example, a stunning Krakowiak    1.6065767145351917
that closes the first act; the mazurka choreographed by Witold    1.5636360329510388
Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera, "Strasny Dwor',    1.4513752902486308
may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see; there    1.67495327387791
is an enchanting polonaise; and the dances and songs from the Tatras    1.6432600607208703
contain a magnificent dance for the men.   Everywhere there are    1.5636360329510388
little touches of humor, and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians    1.67495327387791
is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments    1.6065767145351917
with winning warmth.   1.0
The {THEATRE-BY-THE-SEA}, Matunuck, presents "King    1.1606783668269585
of    1.0
Hearts" by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke. Directed by Michael    1.5636360329510388
Murray; settings by William David Roberts. The cast: @   1.4513752902486308
Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's    1.6065767145351917
opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's "King of Hearts".   1.5127085093302464
The dialogue is sharp, witty and candid- typical "don't eat    1.5636360329510388
the daisies" material- which has stamped the author throughout her    1.5636360329510388
books and plays, and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience    1.6065767145351917
liked it.   The story is of a famous strip cartoonist, an    1.6065767145351917
arty individual, whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts    1.6065767145351917
a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material.   This is    1.6065767145351917
when his troubles begin, not to mention a fiedgling artist who he hires,    1.67495327387791
and who turns out to have ideas of his own, with particular respect    1.67495327387791
to the hero's sweetheart-secretary.   John Heffernan, playing    1.3761581156320553
Larry Larkin, the cartoonist, carries the show in marvelous fashion.    1.5636360329510388
His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.   1.5636360329510388
This may be unfortunate, perhaps, from the standpoint    1.4513752902486308
of David Hedison, Providence's contribution to Hollywood, who is    1.5127085093302464
appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox. Not that    1.5127085093302464
Mr& Hedison does not make the most of his role. He does, and more.    1.7026049541338664
But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist, and it    1.6432600607208703
has to be that way.   A word should be said for Gary Morgan, a    1.7026049541338664
Broadway youngsters who, as the adopted son, makes life miserable for    1.6065767145351917
nearly everybody and Larkin in particular. And for his playmate, Francis    1.6065767145351917
Coletta of West Warwick, who has a bit part, Billy.    1.5636360329510388
On the whole, audiences will like this performance. It is a tremendous    1.6432600607208703
book, lively, constantly moving, and the Matunuck cast does well    1.5636360329510388
by it.   1.0
The {NEWPORT PLAYHOUSE} presents {"EPITAPH FOR    1.2818970554302986
GEORGE DILLON"}    1.0
by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton, directed by Wallace    1.5127085093302464
Gray.   The cast: @   The angriest young man in    1.4513752902486308
Newport last night was at the Playhouse, where "Epitaph for George    1.6065767145351917
Dillon" opened as the jazz festival closed.   For the hero    1.5636360329510388
of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered    1.67495327387791
by more than the lack of beer during a jam session. He's mad    1.67495327387791
at a world he did not make.   Furthermore, he's something of    1.6065767145351917
a scoundrel, an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips.    1.6065767145351917
This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards. They not only    1.7026049541338664
think and feel cliches but live cliches as well.   It is into this    1.67495327387791
household, one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls    1.5636360329510388
out of its people, that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the    1.67495327387791
play.   An unsuccessful playwright and actor, he has faith only    1.5636360329510388
in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists. By the end of the    1.748515906000203
third act, the artist is dead but the body lingers on, a shell among other    1.7269387314284994
shells.   Not altogether a successful play, "Epitaph for    1.4513752902486308
George Dillon" overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in    1.5636360329510388
a lesser work might be crippling. It is awfully talky, for instance,    1.6432600607208703
and not all of the talk is terribly impressive. But it strikes sparks    1.67495327387791
on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten.    1.6065767145351917
There is a fine second act, as an example, one in which Samuel Groom,    1.7026049541338664
as Dillon, has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage    1.6432600607208703
after another. This is an exciting young actor to watch.    1.5636360329510388
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart,    1.67495327387791
whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch.    1.6065767145351917
Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish, almost an    1.6432600607208703
icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment.   Also fine are    1.6065767145351917
Sue Lawless, as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female    1.6432600607208703
spider and just as destructive, Harold Cherry, as her scratchy    1.5636360329510388
spouse, and Hildy Weissman, as a vegetable in human form.   Wallace    1.6065767145351917
Gray has directed a difficult play here, usually well, but with    1.6065767145351917
just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste.    1.7026049541338664
Still, his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection    1.67495327387791
of that pale sustenance, despair.   1.1606783668269585
The {WARWICK MUSICAL THEATER} presents {"Where's    1.2818970554302986
Charley?"} with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, directed    1.5127085093302464
by Christopher Hewett, choreography by Peter Conlow, musical direction    1.5127085093302464
by Samuel Matlowsky. The cast: @   Everybody fell    1.3761581156320553
in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater,    1.6432600607208703
and Shelley Berman was to blame.   One of the finest soft shoe    1.6432600607208703
tunes ever invented, "Once in Love with Amy" is also, of course,    1.6432600607208703
one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come    1.6432600607208703
out of American musical comedy in our era. So the audience last    1.6432600607208703
night was all ears and eyes just after Act /2, got a rousing opening    1.7026049541338664
chorus, "Where's Charley?", and Berman sifted out all alone    1.5127085093302464
on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering    1.7026049541338664
into being.   It is greatly to Berman's credit that he    1.5636360329510388
made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger. He dropped his earlier and delightful    1.67495327387791
hamming, which is about the only way to handle the old war horse    1.67495327387791
called "Charley's Aunt", and let himself go with as an appealing    1.6065767145351917
an "Amy" as anybody could ask.   In brief, Berman played    1.5636360329510388
himself and not Bolger. The big audience started applauding even    1.5636360329510388
before he had finished.   The whole production this week is fresh    1.6065767145351917
and lively. The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous    1.5636360329510388
gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days. The ballet work    1.6432600607208703
is on the nose, especially in the opening number by "The New Ashmolean    1.67495327387791
Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band", along    1.3761581156320553
with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later.   Berman, whose    1.5636360329510388
fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist,    1.7026049541338664
proved himself very much at home in musical comedy.   Sparrow-size    1.5636360329510388
Virginia Gibson, with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful    1.5127085093302464
smile, made a suitably perky Amy, while Melisande Congdon, as the real    1.6432600607208703
aunt, was positively    1.0
monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner.   1.4513752902486308
All told, "Where's Charley?" ought not to be missed.    1.5127085093302464
It has a fast pace, excellent music, expert direction, and not only    1.6432600607208703
a good comedian, but an appealing person in his own right, Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Berman.   1.0

and the production was directed by Mr& Abbott. The cast:    1.5636360329510388
@   This is one of the happier events of the season.    1.5636360329510388
The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night    1.6065767145351917
and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce, the politicians    1.6432600607208703
are in fine voice, the chorines evoke happy memories, and the Little    1.6432600607208703
Flower rides to break a lance again.   I saw "Fiorello!"    1.5636360329510388
performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company    1.67495327387791
is every bit as good, and perhaps better.   Certainly in the matter    1.6432600607208703
of principals there is nothing lacking. Bob Carroll may not bear    1.6065767145351917
quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley    1.6065767145351917
does, but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello    1.7026049541338664
as the evening progressed, until one had to catch one's self up and    1.67495327387791
remember that this wasn't really LaGuardia come back among us again.   1.6065767145351917
Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben, the distraught    1.5636360329510388
Republican Party district chieftain. And Paul Lipson, as Morris,    1.5127085093302464
the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner, was    1.6432600607208703
fine, too.   As for the ladies, they were full of charm, and sincerity,    1.67495327387791
and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving, honest,    1.5636360329510388
little man. Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie,    1.5636360329510388
who became the second Mrs& LaGuardia, singing and acting with    1.5636360329510388
remarkable conviction. Jen Nelson, as Thea, his first wife, managed    1.5636360329510388
to make that short role impressive. And little Zeme North, a Dora    1.6432600607208703
with real spirit and verve, was fascinating whether she was singing of    1.6432600607208703
her love for Floyd, the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then    1.6432600607208703
is promoted into garbage, or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings.   1.6432600607208703
Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual    1.5127085093302464
treatment of "On the Side of the Angels" and "Politics and Poker"    1.6432600607208703
were handled splendidly, and I thought Rudy Bond and his band    1.6065767145351917
of tuneful ward-heelers made "Little Tin Box" even better than    1.5636360329510388
it was done by the New York cast; all the words of its clever    1.7026049541338664
lyrics came through with perfect clarity.   The party at Floyd's    1.5636360329510388
penthouse gave the "chorines" a chance for a nostalgic frolic    1.5636360329510388
through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic    1.6065767145351917
statement of the era's nonsense.   LaGuardia's multi-lingual    1.3761581156320553
rallies, when he is running for Congress, are well staged,    1.5636360329510388
and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical    1.67495327387791
theater.   Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for    1.5127085093302464
himself as a successful stager of touring productions. Not a corner    1.6065767145351917
has been visibly cut in this one. The sets are remarkably elaborate    1.6432600607208703
for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place, and they    1.67495327387791
are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness.    1.67495327387791
(Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were    1.5127085093302464
being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience    1.7026049541338664
with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their    1.6432600607208703
eyes. I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this    1.6432600607208703
"Fiorello!")   It has all been done in superb style,    1.5127085093302464
and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts    1.7026049541338664
who enjoys good musical theater.   1.1606783668269585
{LOEW'S THEATER} presents {"Where the Boys are"},    1.3761581156320553
an ~MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed    1.5127085093302464
by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells. The cast: @   1.6065767145351917
Since the hero, a sterling and upright fellow, is a rich Brown    1.6432600607208703
senior, while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists, I suppose    1.6065767145351917
I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on "Where the    1.6065767145351917
Boys are", but I shall do nothing of the sort.   Instead-    1.6065767145351917
and not just to prove my objectivity- I hasten to report that it's    1.67495327387791
a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of    1.6432600607208703
reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort    1.6065767145351917
Lauderdale, and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with    1.6432600607208703
the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group-    1.6432600607208703
that is to say, sex.   The answers the girls give struck    1.6065767145351917
me as reasonably varied and healthily individual. If most of them weren't    1.6432600607208703
exactly specific- well, that's the way it is in life, I guess.    1.6432600607208703
But at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't    1.6065767145351917
profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems    1.6432600607208703
instead.   "Where the Boys Are" also has a juvenile bounce    1.5636360329510388
that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy. There are some sharp    1.6432600607208703
and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations- the best    1.5636360329510388
of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where    1.67495327387791
a "mermaid" is performing.   Most of the female faces are    1.5636360329510388
new, or at least not too familiar. Dolores Hart, is charming in a leading    1.7026049541338664
role, and quite believable. I was delighted with Paula Prentiss'    1.5636360329510388
comedy performance, which was as fresh and unstilted as one's    1.5636360329510388
highest hopes might ask. A couple of the males made good comedy, too-    1.67495327387791
Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin.   The only performance which    1.5127085093302464
was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux, but since someone    1.67495327387791
had to become the victim of despoilers, just to emphasize that such things    1.67495327387791
do happen at these fracases, I suppose this was the attitude the    1.6432600607208703
part called for. I must say, however, that I preferred the acting that    1.67495327387791
had something of a biting edge to it.   To anyone who remembers    1.6432600607208703
Newport at its less than maximum violence, this view of what the    1.6432600607208703
boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz    1.7026049541338664
Festival ought to prove entertaining.   The second feature,    1.4513752902486308
{"The Price of Silence"}, is a British detective story that    1.5636360329510388
will talk your head off.   1.1606783668269585
The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James    1.5127085093302464
was never more evident than in his letters. Here was a man with an    1.7026049541338664
enormous gift for living as well as thinking. To both persons and ideas    1.67495327387791
he brought the same delighted interest, the same open-minded relish    1.5636360329510388
for what was unique in each, the same discriminating sensibility and    1.6065767145351917
quicksilver intelligence, the same gallantry of judgment.   For    1.4513752902486308
this latest addition to the Great Letters Series, under the general    1.6065767145351917
editorship of Louis Kronenberger, Miss Hardwick has made a selection    1.5636360329510388
which admirably displays the variety of James's genius, not    1.5127085093302464
to mention the felicities of his style. And how he could <write!>    1.6432600607208703
His famous criticism of brother Henry's "third style" is surely    1.5636360329510388
as subtly, even elegantly, worded an analysis of the latter's intricate    1.6065767145351917
air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced. His letter    1.6065767145351917
to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant,    1.67495327387791
forthright, and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up    1.6432600607208703
penned to a sensitive child, and with just the right tone of unpatronizing    1.67495327387791
Most of all, his letters to his philosophic    1.4513752902486308
colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help    1.6065767145351917
to explain Whitehead's reference to James as "that adorable genius".    1.5636360329510388
Miss Hardwick speaks of his "superb gift for intellectual    1.5127085093302464
friendship", and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life    1.6432600607208703
lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.   1.5636360329510388
This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where    1.7026049541338664
there seems to be an increasing lack of communication- or even desire    1.6432600607208703
for communication- between differing schools of thought. It holds    1.5127085093302464
an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word "intellectual"    1.6065767145351917
has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people    1.6065767145351917
who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human    1.6432600607208703
virtues.   To his Harvard colleague, Josiah Royce, whose philosophic    1.5127085093302464
position differed radically from his own, James could write,    1.5127085093302464
"Different as our minds are, yours has nourished mine, as no other    1.6432600607208703
social influence ever has, and in converse with you I have always felt    1.67495327387791
that my life was being lived importantly".   Of another colleague,    1.5636360329510388
George Santayana, he could write: "The great event in    1.5127085093302464
my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book. Although    1.6065767145351917
I absolutely reject the Platonism of it, I have literally squealed    1.6065767145351917
with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position    1.5636360329510388
Writing to his colleague    1.0
George Herbert Palmer- "Glorious old Palmer", as he addresses    1.5127085093302464
him- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really    1.6432600607208703
understand Royce, Santayana, Palmer, and himself and see that    1.5127085093302464
their varying systems are "so many religions, ways of fronting life,    1.6065767145351917
and worth fighting for", then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic    1.6065767145351917
universe. "The best condition of it would be an open conflict    1.6065767145351917
and rivalry of the diverse systems **h. The world might ring with the    1.67495327387791
struggle, if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other".   1.5636360329510388
The "belaboring" is of course jocular, yet James was    1.5127085093302464
not lacking in fundamental seriousness- unless we measure him by    1.5636360329510388
that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who    1.6065767145351917
stakes all on his vision of God. To James this vision never quite    1.67495327387791
came, despite his appreciation of it in others.   But there is a    1.6432600607208703
dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one    1.7026049541338664
correspondent:    1.0
"You ask what I am going to 'reply' to Bradley.    1.5636360329510388
But why need one reply to everything and everybody? **h I think    1.6432600607208703
that readers generally hate <minute> polemics and recriminations.    1.4513752902486308
All polemic of ours should, I believe, be either very broad statements    1.6432600607208703
of contrast, or fine points treated singly, and as far as possible    1.6432600607208703
impersonally **h. As far as the rising generation goes, why not simply    1.6432600607208703
express ourselves positively, and trust that the truer view quietly    1.5636360329510388
will displace the other. Here again 'God will know his own'".   1.6065767145351917
The collected works of James Thurber, now numbering 25 volumes    1.5636360329510388
(including the present exhibit) represent a high standard of literary    1.5636360329510388
excellence, as every schoolboy knows. The primitive-eclogue quality    1.4513752902486308
of his drawings, akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall,    1.67495327387791
is equally well known. About all that remains to be said is that the    1.7026049541338664
present selection, most of which appeared first in The New Yorker,    1.6065767145351917
comprises (as usual) a slightly unstrung necklace, held together by little    1.6065767145351917
more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the    1.6432600607208703
book.   The one unifying note, if any, is sounded in the initial    1.6432600607208703
article entitled: "How to Get Through the Day". It is repeated    1.6065767145351917
at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs,    1.5636360329510388
the hospitalized, and others forced to rely on inner resources,    1.5636360329510388
including (in the ~P's alone) "palindromes", "paraphrases",    1.3761581156320553
and "parodies".   "The Tyranny of Trivia" suggests    1.3761581156320553
arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber. And new vistas    1.5127085093302464
of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled:    1.5127085093302464
"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs",    1.3761581156320553
"Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream", and "The New Vocabularianism".    1.6065767145351917
Some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong    1.3761581156320553
potions of mixed metaphor, malapropism, and gobbledygook and are recommended    1.5636360329510388
A burlesque paean    1.0
entitled: "Hark the Herald Tribune, Times, and All the Other    1.5636360329510388
Angels Sing" brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture    1.4513752902486308
ballyhooey. "How the Kooks Crumble" features an amusingly    1.4513752902486308
accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-~TV    1.5636360329510388
commercials, and "The Watchers of the Night" is a veritable    1.5636360329510388
waking nightmare.   A semi-serious literary document entitled    1.3761581156320553
"The Wings of Henry James" is noteworthy, if only for a keenly    1.6432600607208703
trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult    1.4513752902486308
later period by modest Owen Wister, author of "The Virginian".    1.5636360329510388
James, he remarks in a letter to a friend, "is attempting the impossible    1.67495327387791
**h namely, to produce upon the reader, as a painting produces    1.6065767145351917
upon the gazer, a number of superimposed, simultaneous impressions. He    1.5636360329510388
would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you    1.7026049541338664
could read them all at once, and get all at once, the various shadings    1.7026049541338664
and complexities".   Equally penetrating in its fashion is    1.4513752902486308
the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation:    1.67495327387791
"So much has already been written about everything that you can't    1.6065767145351917
find out anything about it". Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance    1.5636360329510388
(also a quotation): "Woman's place is in the wrong". Who    1.5636360329510388
but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences?   1.6065767145351917
A tribute to midsummer "bang-sashes" seems terribly funny,    1.4513752902486308
though it would be hard to explain why. "One of them banged the sash    1.7026049541338664
of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped    1.67495327387791
out of sleep and out of bed. 'It's just a bat' said my wife reassuringly,    1.7269387314284994
and I sighed with relief. 'Thank God for that' I said;    1.6065767145351917
In a sense,    1.0
perhaps, Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter    1.5127085093302464
(was it Salvador Dali?) who first conceived the startling fancy of    1.6065767145351917
a picture window in the abdomen. That is, it is literally a picture    1.67495327387791
window: you don't see into the viscera; you see a picture- trees,    1.6432600607208703
or flowers. This is something like what Thurber's best effects    1.5636360329510388
are like, if I am not mistaken.   Though no longer able to turn    1.67495327387791
out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches (several old favorites are    1.5127085093302464
scattered through the present volume) Thurber has retained unimpaired    1.5127085093302464
his vision of humor as a thing of simple, unaffected humanness. In    1.6432600607208703
his concluding paragraph he writes: "The devoted writer of humor    1.5636360329510388
will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can". For many    1.7269387314284994
readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight.   1.5127085093302464
The latest Low is a puzzler. The master's hand has lost none    1.6432600607208703
of its craft. He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions    1.7269387314284994
of political and diplomatic life in the fifties. The reader    1.5636360329510388
meets a few old friends like Blimp and the ~TUC horse, and    1.6432600607208703
becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like    1.6432600607208703
the bomb itself, and civilization in her classic robe watching the    1.6065767145351917
nuclear arms race, her hair standing straight out.   But there    1.5636360329510388
is a difference between the present volume and the early Low. There    1.6432600607208703
is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings    1.7026049541338664
show. But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were    1.6432600607208703
Anyone    1.0
can draw his own conclusions from this difference. It might be    1.6065767145351917
argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish    1.6432600607208703
the artist with drama in a lower key. But this argument cannot be    1.67495327387791
pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings    1.6432600607208703
of its leaders in respect to corrosion. The Communists wield    1.5636360329510388
a power unknown to Hitler. And the leading issue, that of piecemeal    1.6432600607208703
aggression, remains the same. This is drama enough.   Do we ourselves    1.6065767145351917
offer Mr& Low less of a crusade? In the thirties we would    1.6432600607208703
not face our enemy; that was a nightmarish situation and Low was    1.6432600607208703
in his element. Now we have stood up to the Communists; we are stronger    1.7026049541338664
and more self-confident- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights.   1.6432600607208703
Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere?    1.5636360329510388
It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they    1.67495327387791
do not outrage him now. He writes, "Confucius held that in times    1.6432600607208703
of stress one should take short views- only up to lunchtime".   1.6065767145351917
Whatever the cause, his mood in the fifties rarely rises above    1.6065767145351917
the level of the capably sardonic. Dulles? He does not seem to have    1.67495327387791
caught the subtleties of the man. McCarthy? The skies turn dark    1.6065767145351917
but the clouds do not loose their wrath. Suez? Low seems to have    1.67495327387791
supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently,    1.6432600607208703
Stalin's death,    1.0
Churchill's farewell to public life, Hillary and Tensing on Everest,    1.5636360329510388
Quemoy and Matsu- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade.    1.6432600607208703
Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles. Their Eisenhower    1.5636360329510388
is insubstantial. Did Low decide to let well enough alone when    1.6065767145351917
he made his selections?   He often drew the bomb. He showed puny    1.6432600607208703
men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines. And Khrushchev turned    1.5127085093302464
out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all.    1.67495327387791
But, but and but.   Look in this book for weak mortals and only    1.67495327387791
on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale. Read the moderately    1.67495327387791
brief text, not for captions, sometimes for tart epigrams, once    1.5636360329510388
in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas.   1.67495327387791
A gray fox with a patch on one eye- confidence man, city slicker,    1.67495327387791
lebensraum specialist- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this    1.5636360329510388
third relaxed allegory from Mr& Burman's refreshing Louisiana    1.4513752902486308
animal community.   The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he    1.5636360329510388
arrives from New Orleans, accompanied by one wharf rat. But like all    1.6432600607208703
despots, as he builds his following from among the gullible, he grows    1.6432600607208703
more threatening toward those who won't follow- such solid citizens    1.5636360329510388
as Doc Raccoon; Judge Black, the vegetarian black snake;    1.5127085093302464
and the eagle, who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in    1.7269387314284994
Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces.   As soon as the fox    1.5636360329510388
has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats, who,    1.7026049541338664
of course, say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination    1.6065767145351917
campaign    1.0
in the city. (The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved    1.5636360329510388
about the very things    1.0
they plan to do to others.) They train the mink    1.5636360329510388
and other animals to fight. And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that    1.67495327387791
he won't have anyone around that's against him, and setting out    1.6065767145351917
to break his second territorial treaty with the birds.   Robert    1.5636360329510388
Hillyer, the poet, writes in his introduction to this brief animal    1.6065767145351917
fable that Mr& Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish    1.67495327387791
Bend series. He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be    1.67495327387791
given fewer prizes. But it's hard to imagine Mr& Burman as a Nobel    1.67495327387791
laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous    1.6065767145351917
fables.   In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern    1.5127085093302464
dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris (Uncle Remus) and    1.5636360329510388
the polished, witty fables of James Thurber.   1.3761581156320553
George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the    1.5127085093302464
West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War /2, is the    1.7269387314284994
finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years.    1.6065767145351917
It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work: Scrupulous    1.6065767145351917
scholarship, a fund of personal experience, a sense of drama and characterization    1.6432600607208703
and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues.   1.5636360329510388
In short, the book, based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard    1.6065767145351917
University, is both reliable and readable; the author possesses    1.5127085093302464
an uncommonly fine English style, and he is dealing with subjects    1.6065767145351917
of vast importance that are highly topical for our time. If Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals, if his analysis    1.6432600607208703
of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars    1.67495327387791
and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic- well, the    1.5636360329510388
record itself is not too encouraging.   Mr& Kennan takes careful    1.5636360329510388
account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical    1.5127085093302464
atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken. But he rejects,    1.5636360329510388
perhaps a little too sweepingly, the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist    1.6065767145351917
influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin    1.5636360329510388
which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high    1.67495327387791
point at the Yalta Conference in February, 1945.   After all,    1.5636360329510388
Alger Hiss, subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he    1.5636360329510388
gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents, was at Yalta.    1.6065767145351917
And Harry Dexter White, implicated in F&B&I& reports    1.4513752902486308
in Communist associations, was one of the architects of the Morgenthau    1.6065767145351917
Plan, which had it ever been put into full operation, would have    1.6432600607208703
simply handed Germany to Stalin. One item in this unhappy scheme was    1.6432600607208703
to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors,    1.5127085093302464
among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength.   1.5636360329510388
It is quite probable, however, that stupidity, inexperience and    1.5127085093302464
childish adherence to slogans like "unconditional surrender" had    1.4513752902486308
more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than    1.7026049541338664
treason or sympathy with Communism. Mr& Kennan sums up his judgment    1.6065767145351917
of what went wrong this way:    1.2818970554302986
"You see,    1.0
first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills, the unshakeable    1.748515906000203
American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender:    1.4513752902486308
The tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as    1.7026049541338664
a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given    1.7026049541338664
status quo, but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and    1.67495327387791
total evil, with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought    1.67495327387791
to the complete destruction of the enemy's power, no matter what disadvantages    1.6432600607208703
or complications this might involve for the more distant    1.5127085093302464
future".   Recognizing that there could have been no effective    1.5127085093302464
negotiated peace with Hitler, he points out the shocking failure to    1.6065767145351917
give support to the anti-Nazi underground, which very nearly eliminated    1.5636360329510388
Hitler in 1944. A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge    1.5636360329510388
of Russian language, history and literature, Kennan recalls how, at    1.5636360329510388
the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, he penned    1.67495327387791
a private note to a State Department official, expressing the hope    1.6065767145351917
that "never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in    1.5636360329510388
the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries".   The    1.5636360329510388
hope was vain. With justified bitterness the author speaks of "what    1.6065767145351917
seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the    1.67495327387791
nature of the Russian Communist movement, about the history of its    1.6065767145351917
diplomacy, about what had happened in the purges, and about what had    1.6432600607208703
been going on in Poland and the Baltic States". He also speaks of    1.67495327387791
Franklin D& Roosevelt's "puerile" assumption that "if only    1.4513752902486308
he (Stalin) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone    1.6065767145351917
like F&D&R& himself, ideological preconceptions would melt and    1.4513752902486308
Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged".   1.5127085093302464
No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy    1.4513752902486308
was a wistful desire for the return of the "good old days" of Roosevelt.   1.7026049541338664
This fascinating story begins with a sketch, rich in    1.5127085093302464
personal detail, of the glancing mutual impact of World War /1, and    1.6432600607208703
the two instalments of the Russian Revolution. The first of these    1.6065767145351917
involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government    1.6065767145351917
in March, 1917; the second, the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks    1.6432600607208703
(who later called themselves Communists) in November of the    1.5127085093302464
same year.   As Kennan shows, the judgment of the Allied governments    1.6065767145351917
about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession    1.6065767145351917
of defeating Germany. They were blind to the evidence that nothing    1.6065767145351917
could keep the Russian people fighting. They attributed everything    1.5127085093302464
that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue. This,    1.6065767145351917
more than any other factor, led to the fiasco of Allied intervention.    1.6432600607208703
As the author very justly says:   "Had a world war not been    1.6432600607208703
in progress, there would never, under any conceivable stretch of the    1.6065767145351917
imagination, have been an Allied intervention in North Russia".    1.5127085093302464
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated    1.6065767145351917
by Communist propaganda; here Kennan, operating with precise    1.4513752902486308
facts and figures, performs an excellent job of debunking.    1.5127085093302464
Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's    1.5636360329510388
vivid style, the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators    1.5127085093302464
whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may    1.6065767145351917
be selected. On Stalin:   "This was a man of incredible criminality,    1.6065767145351917
of a criminality effectively without limits; a man apparently    1.5127085093302464
foreign to the very experience of love, without mercy or pity;    1.6065767145351917
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe; a man whose hand was set    1.7269387314284994
against all that could not be useful to him at the moment; a man who    1.7269387314284994
was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators    1.6432600607208703
in crime **h".   And here is Kennan's image of Hitler,    1.5636360329510388
Stalin's    1.0
temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of    1.4513752902486308
weaker peoples, and his later enemy:   "Behind that Charlie    1.5127085093302464
Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered    1.6065767145351917
his forehead, behind the tirades and the sulky silences, the passionate    1.6065767145351917
orations and the occasional dull evasive stare, behind the prejudices,    1.5636360329510388
the cynicism, the total amorality of behavior, behind even the tendency    1.6065767145351917
to great strategic mistakes, there lay a statesman of no mean qualities:    1.6432600607208703
Shrewd, calculating, in many ways realistic, endowed- like    1.4513752902486308
Stalin- with considerable powers of dissimulation, capable of playing    1.5127085093302464
his cards very close to his chest when he so desired, yet bold and    1.7026049541338664
resolute in his decisions, and possessing one gift Stalin did not    1.6065767145351917
possess: The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion    1.6432600607208703
and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word".   Two criticisms    1.6065767145351917
of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment    1.5636360329510388
of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges- there is    1.6065767145351917
no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan. And    1.6065767145351917
in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary    1.5636360329510388
world, one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come    1.6432600607208703
to grips with the baffling riddle of our time: How to deal with    1.67495327387791
a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.   1.5636360329510388
But one should not ask for everything. Mr& Kennan, who has recently    1.6432600607208703
abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently    1.6065767145351917
appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia, is not the only man who    1.6065767145351917
finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.    1.67495327387791
The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations    1.6065767145351917
is vitally important, and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical    1.7026049541338664
narrator.    1.0
The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter    1.7026049541338664
political    1.0
or domestic unrest, lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit    1.5636360329510388
and charm. In "Donnybrook", there is quite a different Eire, a    1.6065767145351917
rural land where singing, dancing, fist-fighting and romancing are the    1.5636360329510388
thing. There is plenty of violence, to be sure, but it is a nice violence    1.7269387314284994
and no one gets killed. By and large, Robert McEnroe's adaptation    1.6065767145351917
of Maurice Walsh's film, "The Quiet Man", provides    1.4513752902486308
the entertainment it set out to, and we have a lively musical show if    1.7026049541338664
not a superlative one. _@_ This is the tale of one John Enright,    1.6432600607208703
an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring    1.6432600607208703
and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become    1.748515906000203
a quiet man. But Innesfree, where Ellen Roe Danaher and her    1.6065767145351917
bullying brother, Will, live, is no place for a man who will not use    1.7026049541338664
his fists. So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded    1.6065767145351917
considerably, thereby providing the tale which is told. You may be    1.6065767145351917
sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with    1.7269387314284994
the brother, and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way    1.67495327387791
to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means.    1.5636360329510388
Then there is a matchmaker, one Mikeen Flynn, a role for which Eddie    1.67495327387791
Foy was happily selected. Now there is no reason in the world why    1.67495327387791
a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe    1.6432600607208703
dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs, torso and neck,    1.6432600607208703
except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play.    1.6432600607208703
Mr& Foy is a joy, having learned his dancing by practicing it    1.6432600607208703
until he is practically perfect. His matchmaking is, naturally, incidental,    1.5636360329510388
and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes    1.6065767145351917
him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.   Art Lund, a fine    1.7026049541338664
big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice, impersonates    1.7026049541338664
Enright. Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic    1.6065767145351917
technique, that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have,    1.6065767145351917
anyway. Joan Fagan, a fiery redhead who can impress you that she    1.6432600607208703
has a temper whether she really has one or not, plays Ellen, and sings    1.7026049541338664
the role very well, too. If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has    1.6432600607208703
a bit of theatrical dross in it, never mind; she fits into the general    1.7026049541338664
scheme well enough.   Susan Johnson, as the widow, spends the    1.5636360329510388
first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented    1.67495327387791
death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new    1.7026049541338664
one. She has a good, firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues    1.7269387314284994
of the evening.   Then there are a pair of old biddies played    1.6432600607208703
by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf    1.67495327387791
of stock Irish characters, but they put such a combination of good    1.6432600607208703
will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining.    1.5636360329510388
And in the role of Will Danaher, Philip Bosco roars and sneers    1.6432600607208703
sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British    1.6065767145351917
army, if he chose.   "Donnybrook" is no "Brigadoon",    1.4513752902486308
but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some    1.6432600607208703
excellent dancing. The ballads are sweet and sad, and the music generally    1.6432600607208703
competent. It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after    1.5636360329510388
the final curtain, and some of it, such as the catchy "Sez I",    1.67495327387791
does. "A Toast To The Bride", sung by Clarence Nordstrom, playing    1.6065767145351917
a character called Old Man Toomey, is quite simple, direct and    1.6065767145351917
touching.   The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in    1.5636360329510388
cloth caps and sweaters, and their dancing and singing is fine. So is    1.67495327387791
that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep    1.67495327387791
under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction. The male dancers    1.5127085093302464
sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and    1.6065767145351917
stimulating.   Rouben Ter-Arutunian, in his stage settings,    1.3761581156320553
often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr& Cole has placed couples    1.6432600607208703
or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow.    1.7269387314284994
There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty    1.6432600607208703
good time at "Donnybrook", unless they are permanently in the    1.5636360329510388
mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable    1.7026049541338664
Irish.   1.0
WE can all breathe more easily this morning- more easily    1.5636360329510388
and joyously, too- because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show,    1.6065767145351917
"Fanny", into a delightful and heart-warming film.   The    1.4513752902486308
task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio    1.6065767145351917
of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting    1.6432600607208703
them again on the screen, after their passage through the Broadway    1.6065767145351917
musical idiom, was a delicate and perilous one, indeed. More than    1.6065767145351917
the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star, the great    1.67495327387791
Raimu, were looking askance at the project. The fans of the musical    1.6432600607208703
were, too.   But now the task is completed and the uncertainty    1.6065767145351917
resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music    1.6065767145351917
Hall yesterday. Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether    1.6432600607208703
partial to music or no, you can't help but derive joy from this    1.67495327387791
picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.   1.6065767145351917
SOME of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in    1.5636360329510388
the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow.    1.5636360329510388
A tiny handful never did make the concert. But, after a fifteen-minute    1.6432600607208703
delay, the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage    1.4513752902486308
for the afternoon's proceedings. They faced a rather small audience,    1.5636360329510388
as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures    1.6432600607208703
of the afternoon.   It was an excellent concert. Paul    1.5127085093302464
Paray, rounding out his current stint with the orchestra, is a solid    1.6432600607208703
musician, and the Philharmonic plays for him. Their collaboration in    1.5636360329510388
the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid, intelligent and natural sounding.    1.5636360329510388
It was not a heavy, ponderous Beethoven. The music sang nicely,    1.6065767145351917
sprinted evenly when necessary, was properly accented and balanced.    1.5127085093302464
 The Franck symphonic poem, "Psyche", is a    1.3761581156320553
lush,    1.0
sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again. Fortunate    1.5636360329510388
for the music itself, it is not too frequent a visitor; if    1.6432600607208703
it were, its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying.   1.5636360329510388
Mr& Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic    1.5127085093302464
elements of the score. He did not let the strings, for instance,    1.6432600607208703
weep, whine or get hysterical. His interpretation was a model of refinement    1.6432600607208703
and accuracy.   And in the Prokofieff ~C major Piano    1.5127085093302464
Concerto, with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist, he was an admirable partner.    1.6065767145351917
Mr& Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold, sweeping    1.5127085093302464
and tonally percussive. He swept through the music with ease, in a    1.6432600607208703
An impressive technician,    1.0
Mr& Skolovsky has fine rhythm, to boot. His tone is the    1.6065767145351917
weakest part of his equipment; it tends to be hard and colorless.    1.6432600607208703
A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this    1.67495327387791
concerto needs. It is, after all, a non-romantic work (even with the    1.6432600607208703
big, juicy melody of the second movement); and the composer himself    1.6065767145351917
was called the "age of steel pianist". But granted all this, one    1.6432600607208703
still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than    1.67495327387791
Mr& Skolovsky supplied.   Taken as a whole, though, it was    1.5636360329510388
a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra. Mr& Skolovsky    1.5636360329510388
fully deserved the warm reception he received.   A new work on    1.6065767145351917
the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's "Festival Overture",    1.3761581156320553
receiving its first New York hearing. This was composed last year as    1.6432600607208703
a salute to the automobile industry. It is not program music, though.    1.6432600607208703
It runs a little more than ten minutes, is workmanlike, busy, methodical    1.6432600607208703
and featureless.   1.0
"La Gioconda", like it or not, is a singer's opera. And    1.6065767145351917
so, of course, it is a fan's opera as well. Snow or no, the fans    1.7269387314284994
were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance    1.67495327387791
of the Ponchielli work.   So the plot creaks, the sets    1.5636360329510388
are decaying, the costumes are pre-historic, the orchestra was sloppy    1.5636360329510388
and not very well connected with what the singers were doing. After    1.6432600607208703
all, the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed,    1.7026049541338664
with no less than six leading parts.   One of those parts    1.6065767145351917
is that of evil, evil Barnaba, the spy. His wicked deeds were carried    1.67495327387791
on by Anselmo Colzani, who was taking the part for the first time    1.67495327387791
with the company.   He has the temperament and the stage presence    1.6065767145351917
for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone.    1.6432600607208703
What was lacking was a real sense of phrase, the kind of legato singing    1.7026049541338664
that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is, after    1.6432600607208703
all, a very oily character.   Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare    1.6065767145351917
Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast, but only with respect    1.67495327387791
to this season; they have both sung these parts here before. Laura    1.6432600607208703
is a good role for Miss Resnik, and she gave it force, dramatic color    1.7026049541338664
and passion.   Mr& Siepi was, as always, a consummate actor;    1.5636360329510388
with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently.    1.5127085093302464
Part of this characterization was, of course, accomplished with the    1.5636360329510388
vocal chords. His singing was strong and musical; unfortunately his    1.5636360329510388
voice was out of focus and often spread in quality.   Eileen Farrell    1.6432600607208703
in the title role, Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker    1.6432600607208703
as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season, and    1.5636360329510388
all contributed to a vigorous performance. If only they and Fausto    1.6065767145351917
Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more. @   1.5636360329510388
"MELODIOUS birds sing madrigals" saith the poet and no    1.5127085093302464
better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could    1.5636360329510388
be imagined.   Their Vanguard album {Madrigal Masterpieces}    1.3761581156320553
(~BG 609; stereo ~BGS 5031) is a good sample of the special,    1.6432600607208703
elegant art of English madrigal singing. It also makes a fine introduction    1.6432600607208703
to the international art form with good examples of Italian    1.5636360329510388
and English madrigals plus several French "chansons".    1.3761581156320553
The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better    1.6065767145351917
than anyone else. The original impulses came to England late (in the    1.6432600607208703
sixteenth century) and continue strong long after everyone else had    1.5636360329510388
gone on to the baroque basso continuo, sonatas, operas and the like.   1.6432600607208703
Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian    1.5127085093302464
interregnum, the practice of singing together- choruses, catches    1.4513752902486308
and glees- always flourished. The English never again developed    1.5127085093302464
a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier    1.6432600607208703
great age the way, say, the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian    1.67495327387791
madrigal.    1.0
Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing    1.1606783668269585
dates well back into the nineteenth century in England, much ahead    1.6065767145351917
of similar revivals in other countries. As a result no comparable    1.6065767145351917
literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more    1.6432600607208703
often performed than the English madrigal.   Naturally, Mr&    1.4513752902486308
Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant    1.67495327387791
when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their    1.6432600607208703
countrymen: William Byrd, Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins.    1.4513752902486308
There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing, with a tendency    1.6432600607208703
to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture.    1.6432600607208703
Both techniques give the music purity and clarity.   Claude    1.5127085093302464
Jannequin's vocal description of a battle (the French equivalents    1.5127085093302464
of tarantara, rum-tum-tum, and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque) is    1.5127085093302464
lots of fun, and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other    1.7269387314284994
chansons by Jannequin and Lassus. Only with the more sensual, intense    1.6065767145351917
and baroque expressions of Marenzio, Monteverdi and Gesualdo    1.4513752902486308
does the singing seem a little superficial.   Nevertheless, the    1.5127085093302464
musicality, accuracy and infectious charm of these performances, excellently    1.5127085093302464
reproduced, make it an attractive look-see at the period. The    1.5636360329510388
works are presented chronologically. Texts and translations are provided.    1.5127085093302464
The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin    1.4513752902486308
are strong French characteristics. Baroque instrumental music    1.3761581156320553
in Italy and Germany tends to be strong, lively, intense, controlled    1.6065767145351917
and quite abstract. In France, it remained always more picturesque,    1.5636360329510388
more dancelike, more full of flavor.   Couperin and Rameau    1.5127085093302464
gave titles to nearly everything they wrote, not in the later sense    1.6432600607208703
of "program music" but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close,    1.67495327387791
clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.   1.5636360329510388
Both composers turn up on new imports from France. ~BAM    1.5636360329510388
is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is    1.67495327387791
Editions de la boite a musique. They specialize in out-of-the-way    1.5636360329510388
items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention.    1.67495327387791
{Sonates et Concerts Royaux} of Couperin le grand occupy    1.5127085093302464
two disks (~LD056 and ~LD060) and reveal the impeccable taste    1.5636360329510388
and workmanship of this master- delicate, flexible and gemlike.   1.5127085093302464
The Concerts- Nos& 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 are represented-    1.6065767145351917
are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian    1.6432600607208703
sense. The sonatas, "La Francaise", "La Sultane", "L'Astree"    1.4513752902486308
and "L'Imperiale", are often more elaborately worked    1.3761581156320553
out and, in fact, show a strong Italian influence.   Couperin    1.5636360329510388
also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk    1.6065767145351917
called {Musique Francaise du /18,e Siecle} (~BAM ~LD    1.4513752902486308
060). Jean-Marie LeClair still is remembered a bit, but Bodin de    1.6065767145351917
Beismortier, Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words.    1.4513752902486308
What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal    1.67495327387791
the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo.   1.6065767145351917
The Couperin "La Steinkerque", with its battle music, brevity,    1.5127085093302464
wit and refined simplicity, already shakes off Corelli and points    1.5636360329510388
towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era. If    1.5636360329510388
Couperin shows the fashionable trend, the others do so all the more.   1.6432600607208703
All these records have close, attractive sound and the performances    1.5636360329510388
by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic.   Rameau's    1.4513752902486308
{Six Concerts en Sextuor,} recorded by L'orchestre de    1.4513752902486308
chambre Pierre Menet (~BAM ~LD 046), turn out to be harpsichord    1.6065767145351917
pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself.    1.5127085093302464
The strange, delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes    1.6065767145351917
inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious.   {Maitres    1.4513752902486308
Allemands des /17,e et /18,e Siecles} contains music    1.4513752902486308
by Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Rosenmueller and Telemann, well performed    1.4513752902486308
by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket (~BAM ~LD    1.4513752902486308
035).   1.0
Rococo music- a lot of it- was played in Carnegie Recital    1.6065767145351917
Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored    1.6432600607208703
this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts.   1.6065767145351917
Works by J& C& Bach, Anton Craft, Joseph Haydn, Giuseppe    1.5636360329510388
Sammartini, Comenico Dragonetti and J& G& Janitsch were    1.4513752902486308
performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff, flutist,    1.4513752902486308
Josef Marx, oboist, and Robert Conant, pianist and harpsichordist.   1.5127085093302464
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all,    1.6065767145351917
it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown    1.6065767145351917
accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven    1.5636360329510388
to Boulez.   Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century    1.5636360329510388
charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday    1.6065767145351917
night. Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program,    1.6432600607208703
but taken together they grew quite tiresome.   The performances    1.5127085093302464
were variable, those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying,    1.5636360329510388
some by soloists proving rather trying. @   1.2818970554302986
Ellie Mao, soprano, and Frederick Fuller, baritone, presented    1.4513752902486308
a program of folksongs entitled "East Meets West" in Carnegie    1.5636360329510388
Recital Hall last night. They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee,    1.6065767145351917
pianist.   Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos    1.5127085093302464
and duets in a broad range of languages. Songs from China and Japan    1.67495327387791
were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao, who is a native of China,    1.6432600607208703
and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr& Fuller, who is    1.67495327387791
English by birth.   This was not a program intended to illustrate    1.6065767145351917
authentic folk styles. On the contrary, Miss Mao and Mr& Fuller    1.6065767145351917
chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such    1.6065767145351917
as Mendelssohn, Dvorak, Canteloube, Copland and Britten. Thre    1.4513752902486308
was,    1.0
therefore, more musical substance in the concert than might have been    1.6065767145351917
the case otherwise. The performances were assured, communicative and    1.5127085093302464
pleasingly informal. @   1.0
WHAT was omitted from "A Neglected Education" were    1.4513752902486308
those essentials known as "the facts of life".   Chabrier's    1.5127085093302464
little one-act operetta, presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall,    1.5127085093302464
is a fragile, precious little piece, very French, not without wit    1.6065767145351917
and charm. The poor uneducated newlywed, a certain Gontran de Boismassif,    1.6065767145351917
has his problems in getting the necessary information. The humor    1.5636360329510388
of the situation can be imagined.   It all takes place in the    1.6432600607208703
eighteenth century. What a silly, artificial way of life, Chabrier    1.5636360329510388
and his librettists chuckle. But they wish they could bring it back.    1.6432600607208703
Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where    1.5127085093302464
the classical, rationalist tradition, (handed down to Chabrier largely    1.5127085093302464
in the form of operetta and salon music) becomes virtually neo-classicism.    1.6065767145351917
The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste    1.6065767145351917
and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or    1.6432600607208703
mawkish.   The simple, clever production was also able to tread    1.5636360329510388
the thin line between those extremes. Arlene Saunders was charming as    1.6065767145351917
poor Gontran. Yes, Arlene is her name; the work uses the old eighteenth-century    1.67495327387791
tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced    1.5127085093302464
youth to a soprano. Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife    1.6432600607208703
and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.   1.7269387314284994
The work was presented as the final event in the Town    1.6065767145351917
Hall Festival of Music. It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera,    1.6432600607208703
"The Poor Sailor", set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau, a    1.6065767145351917
kind of Grand Guignol by the sea, a sailor returns, unrecognized, and    1.6432600607208703
gets done in by his wife.   With the exception of a few spots,    1.67495327387791
Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties,    1.6065767145351917
odd harmonies, and lumbering, satiric orchestration.   1.2818970554302986
Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon. Sat there    1.5636360329510388
and as a woman sang, she kept getting thinner and thinner, right    1.6432600607208703
before my eyes, and the eyes of some 5,500 other people.   I make    1.67495327387791
this observation about the lady, Miss Judy Garland, because she brought    1.6065767145351917
up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female    1.6432600607208703
reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote    1.6065767145351917
in the paper the next day:   "Judy Garland has arrived    1.5636360329510388
in London. She's not chubby. She's not plump. She's fat".   1.5636360329510388
But who cares, when the lady sings? Certainly not the largest    1.6065767145351917
afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the    1.6432600607208703
most attentive and quiet. They applauded every number, not only at its    1.6432600607208703
conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme- sometimes    1.6065767145351917
at the first chord.   And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things    1.6432600607208703
which seemed, at times, a blessed relief from the way-out compositions    1.6065767145351917
of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings.    1.5127085093302464
Things like "When You're Smiling", "Almost Like Being In    1.5127085093302464
Love", "Do It Again", "Born to Wander", "Alone Together",    1.5127085093302464
"Who Cares?", "Puttin' on the Ritz", "How    1.3761581156320553
Long Has This Been Going On?" and her own personal songs    1.6065767145351917
like "The Man That Got Away", and the inevitable "Over the    1.6065767145351917
Rainbow".   Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers    1.6065767145351917
of our time but she is one of the superb showmen. At the start of    1.7269387314284994
her program there were evidences of pique. She had held to the letter    1.67495327387791
of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4    1.67495327387791
p&m&, the appointed hour, although the Music at Newport people had    1.6065767145351917
tried to get the program underway at 3. Then there was a bad delay    1.7026049541338664
in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs.   1.5636360329510388
Along about 4:30, just when it was getting to be about time    1.6432600607208703
to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side, Judy    1.67495327387791
came on singing, in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket    1.7026049541338664
that flapped in the wind. Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately    1.5636360329510388
combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk    1.7026049541338664
breeze was blowing.   In her first song she waved away one    1.6065767145351917
encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter    1.5636360329510388
the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm& lenses    1.6432600607208703
and shoot at extreme range.   There also came a brief contretemps    1.6065767145351917
with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during    1.6432600607208703
a quiet moment near the conclusion of "Do It Again", and    1.6065767145351917
she made the tart observation that "I never saw so much moving about    1.67495327387791
in an audience".   But it didn't take Judy Garland, showman,    1.5636360329510388
long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at    1.7026049541338664
Newport and that you have to learn to live with it. Before her chore    1.7026049541338664
was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music, trundling    1.5636360329510388
microphones about the stage, helping to move the piano and otherwise joining    1.6432600607208703
in the informal atmosphere.   And time after time she really    1.5636360329510388
belted out her songs. Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged-    1.6065767145351917
which was the way I felt about her "Come Rain or Come    1.6432600607208703
Shine"- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent, like her    1.5636360329510388
shatteringly beautiful "Beautiful Weather".   To her partisan    1.3761581156320553
audience, such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than    1.5636360329510388
a critic striving to hold his franchise; they just sat back on their    1.67495327387791
haunches and cried for more, as though they could never get enough.   1.6432600607208703
They were rewarded with splendid, exciting, singing. Her "Rockabye    1.5127085093302464
Your Baby" was as good as it can be done, and her really    1.67495327387791
personal songs, like "The Man That Got Away" were deeply moving.   1.6065767145351917
The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard    1.5636360329510388
"Over The Rainbow"- although the fellow that kept crying for    1.5636360329510388
"Get Happy" had to go home unhappy, about that item anyway. She    1.6432600607208703
was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with    1.6432600607208703
its cheers and applause and flowers.   All went home happy except    1.6065767145351917
the Newport police, who feared that the throng departing at 6:35    1.6065767145351917
might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh, and those deprived of    1.6432600607208703
their happy hour at the cocktail bar.   1.3761581156320553
In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning    1.5636360329510388
in the northern skies. This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the    1.67495327387791
evening- flashes in the distance, but no storm.   Several times    1.5636360329510388
it came near breaking, and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder    1.7026049541338664
from Jerry Mulligan's big band, which is about as fine an aggregation    1.6432600607208703
as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond    1.6065767145351917
found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap.   Mulligan's    1.5636360329510388
band has been infected with his solid sense of swing, and what it    1.67495327387791
does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the    1.67495327387791
big concert aggregations.   But what is equally impressive is    1.5127085093302464
the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's    1.6432600607208703
baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement    1.5636360329510388
of "Django's Castle".   For subtle swinging rhythms,    1.3761581156320553
I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of "Weep", and    1.5127085093302464
the fireworks went on display in "18 Carrots for Robert", a sax    1.6432600607208703
tribute to Johnny Hodges.   There was considerable contrast    1.4513752902486308
between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The    1.6065767145351917
Jazz Messengers, who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such    1.6432600607208703
a small group. Unfortunately, Blakey doesn't choose to work much    1.5636360329510388
of the time in this vein. He prefers to have his soloist performing    1.67495327387791
and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.   1.7026049541338664
What we did get, however, was impressive.   A few drops    1.5636360329510388
of rain just before midnight, when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of    1.67495327387791
her first number, scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly,    1.6432600607208703
but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand, most of the listeners    1.7026049541338664
didn't care whether they got wet.   Miss Vaughan was back    1.5636360329510388
in top form, somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time-    1.6432600607208703
like a fine wine. After the spate of female vocalists we have been    1.67495327387791
having, all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried    1.7026049541338664
to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat, it seemed    1.7269387314284994
that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than    1.7026049541338664
ever.    1.0
The evening program was opened    1.1606783668269585
by the Jazz Three, a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein    1.6065767145351917
on bass, Jack Warner, drums, and Don Cook, piano. This was a    1.6432600607208703
continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night    1.6432600607208703
when the Eddie Stack group, also local talent, went on first.    1.6065767145351917
Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple    1.67495327387791
purpose: it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in    1.6432600607208703
this unenviable spot, when the audience is cold, restless, and in flux;    1.6432600607208703
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have    1.6065767145351917
come a long way to hear, and it gives the resident musicians a chance    1.7026049541338664
to perform before the famous Newport audience.   The Jazz Three    1.5636360329510388
displayed their sound musicianship, not only in their own chosen set,    1.6065767145351917
but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns + Leon James, the    1.6065767145351917
superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three    1.6065767145351917
successive years, gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution    1.6432600607208703
of the blues to a spot on the evening program.    1.5636360329510388
Julie Wilson, a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists,    1.5127085093302464
sang a set, a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old    1.7026049541338664
oldies as "Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah", and    1.5127085093302464
the delightful "Sunday". She frosted the cake with the always reliable    1.6065767145351917
"Bill Bailey".   From this taste of the 1920s, we    1.5127085093302464
leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz,    1.6065767145351917
which did lovely, subtle things for "Baubles, Bangles and Beads",    1.5636360329510388
and a couple of ballards.   Getz is a difficult musician to categorize.    1.6432600607208703
He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone, rather than    1.6065767145351917
for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations, and he has    1.5127085093302464
a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising    1.67495327387791
is over. In this he is sticking with tradition, however far removed    1.6432600607208703
from it he may seem to be.    1.3761581156320553
George Shearing    1.0
took over with his well disciplined group, a sextet consisting of    1.6065767145351917
vibes, guitar, bass, drums, Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer.    1.5636360329510388
He met with enthusiastic audience approval, especially when he swung    1.5636360329510388
from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo. Shearing, himself,    1.6065767145351917
seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport    1.67495327387791
appearances.   A very casual, pleasant program- one of those    1.5127085093302464
easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a    1.5127085093302464
relaxing delight- was held again under sunny skies, hot sun, and a fresh    1.67495327387791
breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came    1.67495327387791
to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach.   Divided    1.6432600607208703
almost equally into two parts, it consisted of "The Evolution of    1.6065767145351917
the Blues", narrated by Jon Hendricks, who had presented it last    1.6065767145351917
year at the Monterey, Calif&, Jazz Festival, and an hour-long session    1.6065767145351917
of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra, a blasting big band.   1.5636360329510388
Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small    1.6065767145351917
audience of small children right on stage with him. Tracing the blues    1.6432600607208703
from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country    1.67495327387791
and the West Indies, he stressed the close relationship between    1.5636360329510388
the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches.    1.6065767145351917
To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz    1.5636360329510388
he had "Big" Miller, as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean, Gospel-singer,    1.6065767145351917
while Oscar Brown Jr&, an extremely talented young    1.4513752902486308
man, did a slave auctioneer's call, a field-hands' work song, and    1.6065767145351917
a beautifully sung Negro lullaby, "Brown Baby", which was one of    1.6065767145351917
the truly moving moments of the festival.   One of those delightful    1.6065767145351917
surprise additions, which so frequently occur in jazz programs,    1.5127085093302464
was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones, drumming    1.67495327387791
to "Old Man River", which seems to have been elected the favorite    1.6432600607208703
solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts.   1.6065767145351917
Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues    1.5127085093302464
was Michael Babatunde Olatunji, who plays such native drums as    1.5636360329510388
the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest. He    1.67495327387791
has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of    1.67495327387791
last year's afternoon concerts.   Hendricks had Billy Mitchell,    1.4513752902486308
tenor    1.0
sax; Pony Poindexter, alto sax; Jimmy Witherspoon,    1.3761581156320553
blues singer (and a good one), and the Ike Isaacs Trio, which has done    1.7026049541338664
such wonderful work for two afternoons now, helping him with the musical    1.6432600607208703
examples.   It all went very well.   1.2818970554302986
PIANISTS who are serious about their work are likely to know    1.6065767145351917
the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas. Music    1.4513752902486308
lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent    1.6432600607208703
example, played for ~RCA by Emil Gilels. He has chosen Sonata    1.6065767145351917
Op& 53 in ~D. The playing takes both sides of the disc. Perhaps    1.67495327387791
one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often    1.6065767145351917
is their great length. Rhythmic interest, melodic beauty and the expansiveness    1.6065767145351917
of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention    1.5636360329510388
with the Gilels playing. His technique is ample and his musical ideas    1.6432600607208703
are projected beautifully.   The male chorus of the Robert    1.5127085093302464
Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style. The group is superbly    1.6432600607208703
trained. What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type    1.6432600607208703
of song is in question. Do you say chantey, as if the word were derived    1.7269387314284994
from the French word chanter, to sing, or do you say shanty and think    1.7026049541338664
of a roughly built cabin, which derives its name from the French-Canadian    1.6432600607208703
use of the word chantier, with one of its meanings given as    1.6432600607208703
a boat-yard? I say chantey. Either way, the Robert Shaw chorus    1.6065767145351917
sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame    1.67495327387791
spelled out in terms of agreeable listening. If your favorite song    1.6065767145351917
is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.   The London label offers    1.67495327387791
an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini, a baritone whose fame    1.5636360329510388
is international.   1.0
MURRAY LOUIS and his dance company appeared at the Henry    1.5636360329510388
Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons    1.5636360329510388
in the premiere of his latest work, "Signal", and the repetition    1.6065767145351917
of an earlier one, "Journal".   "Signal" is choreographed    1.4513752902486308
for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais.    1.6065767145351917
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg. Program note reads    1.5636360329510388
as follows:   "Take hands **h this urgent visage beckons us".   1.5636360329510388
Here, as in "Journal", Mr& Louis has given himself    1.5127085093302464
the lion's share of the dancing, and there is no doubt that he is    1.7026049541338664
capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting    1.6432600607208703
physical movements. Indeed, both "Journal" and "Signal"    1.3761581156320553
qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.   1.3761581156320553
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative, and    1.5127085093302464
it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing.    1.6432600607208703
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations    1.6432600607208703
could be transposed without notable loss of effect, there is    1.5636360329510388
too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.   1.4513752902486308
It may be, of course, that Mr& Louis is consciously trying to create    1.67495327387791
works that anticipate an age of total automation. But it may be,    1.6432600607208703
also, that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics    1.6432600607208703
at the present time. One thing is certain, however, and that is that    1.67495327387791
he is far more slavish to the detailed accents, phrasings and contours    1.6432600607208703
of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be. @    1.67495327387791
A brisk, satirical spoof of contemporary    1.2818970554302986
American mores entitled "An American Journey" was given its    1.5127085093302464
first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night    1.5636360329510388
by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company. Choreographed    1.4513752902486308
by Mr& Nagrin, the work filled the second half of a program that    1.67495327387791
also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' "Once    1.6065767145351917
Upon a Time **h" as well as her "Women's Song" and    1.6065767145351917
Mr& Nagrin's "Indeterminate Figure".   Eugene Lester    1.2818970554302986
assembled a witty and explicit score for "An American Journey",    1.5636360329510388
and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes.   1.4513752902486308
Mr& Nagrin has described four "places", each with its scenery    1.5636360329510388
and people, added two "diversions", and concluded with "A    1.5127085093302464
Toccata for the Young", a refreshingly underplayed interpretation    1.4513752902486308
of rock'n'roll dancing.   The "places" could be anywhere,    1.4513752902486308
the idiosyncrasies    1.0
and foibles observed there could be anybody's, and    1.4513752902486308
the laugh is on us all. But we need not mind too much, because Mr&    1.7269387314284994
Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever    1.6065767145351917
almost all the way.   Miss Tamiris' "Once Upon a Time    1.5636360329510388
**h" is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three "figures"    1.7269387314284994
that bother them somehow.   Unfortunately, the man and    1.4513752902486308
woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the    1.67495327387791
menacing figures failed to make them any more so. Nor did the dancing    1.67495327387791
involved really seize the attention at any time. The music here, Russell    1.6432600607208703
Smith's "Tetrameron", sounded good.   All the performances    1.3761581156320553
of the evening were smooth and assured, and the sizable company,    1.6065767145351917
with Mr& Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers, seemed    1.6065767145351917
to be fine shape.   1.0
THE Symphony of the Air, greatly assisted by Van Cliburn,    1.5636360329510388
last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall    1.5636360329510388
off to a good start. At the same time the orchestra announced that    1.67495327387791
next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie, and    1.6065767145351917
that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs, repeating each    1.6432600607208703
of them in five different communities.   This news, announced    1.5127085093302464
by Jerome Toobin, the orchestra's administrative director, brought    1.4513752902486308
applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall. They showed they    1.6432600607208703
were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there    1.6065767145351917
so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln    1.7026049541338664
Center of the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra    1.5127085093302464
and the Boston Symphony.   This season the orchestra has already    1.5636360329510388
taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription    1.67495327387791
concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County    1.5636360329510388
Center in White Plains. The details of the suburban concerts    1.5636360329510388
next season, and the centers in which they will be given, will be announced    1.7026049541338664
The concertos that Van    1.0
Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return    1.6432600607208703
from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky, the Rachmaninoff    1.5636360329510388
Third, and the Prokofieff Third. It was pleasant last night, therefore,    1.6065767145351917
to hear him do something else: a concerto he has recently recorded,    1.6432600607208703
"The Emperor".   The young Texas pianist can make    1.4513752902486308
great chords ring out as well as anyone, so last night the massive sonorities    1.7026049541338664
of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him. But they    1.6065767145351917
were not what distinguished his performance. The elements that did    1.5636360329510388
were the introspective slow movement, the beautiful transition to the    1.5636360329510388
third movement, and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger    1.6432600607208703
moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo.   Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne.    1.67495327387791
Alfred Wallenstein, the conductor, sensitive accompanist that    1.3761581156320553
he is, picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of    1.7269387314284994
broodinf, poetic mystery. The collaboration was remarkable, as it was    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Wallenstein, who    1.0
will lead all of the concerts in the cycle, also conducted the "Leonore"    1.67495327387791
Overture No& 3 and the Fourth Symphony. The orchestra    1.5127085093302464
was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively. And although    1.6432600607208703
there was plenty of vigor in the performance, the ensemble was at    1.6432600607208703
its best when the playing was soft and lyrical, yet full of the suppressed    1.7026049541338664
tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven. Igor Oistrakh    1.6065767145351917
will be the next soloist on Feb& 4.   1.4513752902486308
THERE are times when one suspects that the songs that are    1.6065767145351917
dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be    1.6065767145351917
better than many of those that are left in. Today, in the era of the    1.7269387314284994
integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all    1.6065767145351917
development of the show, it is understandable that a song, no matter    1.6432600607208703
how excellent it may be on its own terms, is cut out because it does    1.7269387314284994
not perform the function required of it.   In the more casually    1.6065767145351917
constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties    1.5127085093302464
there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song    1.6432600607208703
of merit. Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' "The    1.6432600607208703
Man I Love". Deemed too static when it was first heard in "Lady    1.67495327387791
Be Good" in Philadelphia in 1924, it was dropped from the score.    1.6432600607208703
It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version    1.6432600607208703
of "Strike Up the Band" and again abandoned shortly before the    1.6065767145351917
entire show was given up. It finally reached Broadway in the second    1.6432600607208703
and successful version of "Strike Up the Band" in 1929. (Still    1.6065767145351917
another song in "Strike Up the Band"- "I've Got a Crush    1.6065767145351917
on You"- was retrieved from a 1928 failure, "Treasure Girl".)    1.5636360329510388
Like the Gershwins, Richard Rodgers and    1.2818970554302986
Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them. If one    1.7269387314284994
of Mr& Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than    1.6065767145351917
interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure, Mr& Hart    1.6432600607208703
was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance    1.7269387314284994
in another show.   Several of these double entries have been    1.5636360329510388
collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney, along with Rodgers    1.5636360329510388
and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York    1.6065767145351917
and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly    1.67495327387791
heard Rodgers and Hart repertory, in a delightfully refreshing    1.5127085093302464
album, {Rodgers and Hart Revisited} (Spruce Records, 505 Fifth    1.5127085093302464
Avenue, New York).   Among the particular gems in this collection    1.5636360329510388
is the impudent opening song of "The Garrick Gaieties",    1.5127085093302464
an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from    1.67495327387791
Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed; Dorothy Loudon's    1.5636360329510388
raucous listing of the attractions "At the Roxy Music Hall" from    1.6065767145351917
"I Married an Angel"; and the incisive style with which Charlotte    1.6065767145351917
Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of "I Blush",    1.5127085093302464
a song that was cut from "A Connecticut Yankee".   Altogether    1.5636360329510388
fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by    1.5636360329510388
a quintet of able vocalists. Norman Paris has provided them with extremely    1.6432600607208703
effective orchestral accompanimen   Turning to the current    1.3761581156320553
musical season on Broadway, the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals,    1.6432600607208703
{How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying},    1.4513752902486308
has been transferred to an original cast album (R& C& A& Victor    1.6432600607208703
~LOC 1066; stereo ~LSO 1066) that has some entertaining    1.5127085093302464
moments, although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited    1.6065767145351917
by the show might lead one to expect. Robert Morse, singing with comically    1.67495327387791
plaintive earnestness, carries most of the burden and is responsible    1.5636360329510388
for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score.   Rudy    1.5127085093302464
Vallee, who shares star billing with Mr& Morse, makes only two    1.6065767145351917
appearances. He shares with Mr& Morse a parody of the college anthems    1.6432600607208703
he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia    1.7026049541338664
Martin, a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice.    1.6065767145351917
In general, Mr& Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist    1.6432600607208703
than he has as composer.   Like Mr& Loesser, Jerry Herman    1.5636360329510388
is both composer and lyriist for {Milk and Honey} (R&    1.5636360329510388
C&    1.0
A& Victor ~LOC 1065; stereo ~LSO 1065), but in this    1.5636360329510388
case it is the music that stands above the lyrics. For this story of    1.7026049541338664
an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel, Mr& Herman    1.67495327387791
has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles.    1.6432600607208703
There are the full-bodied, resourceful    1.1606783668269585
voices of Robert Weede, Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the    1.6432600607208703
most of Mr& Herman's lilting melodies and, for an occasional    1.5636360329510388
change of pace, the bright humor of Molly Picon. Mr& Herman has    1.6432600607208703
managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American    1.6432600607208703
ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both    1.6432600607208703
idioms.   Not content to create only the music and lyrics, Noe^l    1.6065767145351917
Coward also wrote the book and directed {Sail Away} (Capitol    1.5636360329510388
~WAO 1643; stereo ~SWAO 1643), a saga of life on a    1.6065767145351917
cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr& Coward's more    1.67495327387791
memorable works. The melodies flow along pleasantly, as Mr& Coward's    1.5636360329510388
songs usually do, but his lyrics have a tired, cut-to-a-familiar-pattern    1.5636360329510388
quality. Elaine Stritch, who sings with a persuasively    1.4513752902486308
warm huskiness, belts some life into most of her songs, but the other    1.67495327387791
members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr& Coward's songs.   1.6065767145351917
WITH three fine Russian films in recent months on World    1.5636360329510388
War /2,- "The House I Live In", "The Cranes Are Flying"    1.6065767145351917
and "Ballad of a Soldier"- we had every right to expect    1.6065767145351917
a real Soviet block-buster in "The Day the War Ended". It    1.6065767145351917
simply isn't, not by a long shot. The Artkino presentation, with English    1.6432600607208703
Make no mistake, this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import-    1.6065767145351917
aptly grave, carefully    1.0
written, performed and directed. In describing the initial Allied    1.5127085093302464
occupation of a middle-sized German city, the picture has color, pictorial    1.6065767145351917
pull and genuinely moving moments. Told strictly from the viewpoint    1.5636360329510388
of the Russian conquerors, the film compassionately peers over    1.5127085093302464
the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple, at both sides of the conflict's    1.67495327387791
aftermath.   Unfortunately, the whole picture hinges on this    1.4513752902486308
romance, at the expense of everything else. Tenderly and rather tediously,    1.6065767145351917
the camera rivets on the abrupt, deep love of a pretty nurse    1.6432600607208703
and a uniformed teacher, complicated by nothing more than a friend they    1.6432600607208703
don't want to hurt. It's the old story, war or no war, and more    1.7026049541338664
than one viewer may recall Hollywood's "Titanic", several seasons    1.5127085093302464
back, when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of    1.6065767145351917
a society dilettante.   Not that the picture is superficial. Under    1.5636360329510388
Yakov Segal's direction, it begins stirringly, as crouching Soviet    1.5127085093302464
and Nazi troops silently scan each other, waiting for the first    1.6065767145351917
surrender gesture. One high-up camera shot is magnificent, as the Germans    1.6065767145351917
straggle from a cathedral, dotting a huge, cobblestone square,    1.5127085093302464
and drop their weapons.    1.0
Only    1.0
once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic    1.7269387314284994
sense of sharing a rare experience. "Ring of Bright Water" by    1.6065767145351917
Gavin Maxwell is just that- a haunting, warmly personal chronicle    1.5636360329510388
of a man, an otter, and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands.   1.7026049541338664
"He has married me with **h a ring of bright    1.5636360329510388
water",    1.0
begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title,    1.6065767145351917
and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the    1.7026049541338664
author conveys. The place is Camusfearna, the site of a long-vanished    1.6065767145351917
sea-village opposite the isle of Skye. It is a land of long fjords,    1.67495327387791
few people, a single-lane road miles away- and of wild stags, Greylag    1.6432600607208703
geese, wild swans, dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters.    1.5636360329510388
How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna, his furnishing    1.5636360329510388
the empty house with beach-drift, the subtle changes in season over    1.6065767145351917
ten years, is a moving experience. Just the evocations of time and    1.6432600607208703
place, of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today    1.6432600607208703
seems almost lost, would be enough.   But it isn't. There    1.5636360329510388
is Mijbil, an otter who travelled with Maxwell- and gave Maxwell's    1.6065767145351917
name to a new species- from the Tigris marshes to his London    1.6432600607208703
flat. It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more    1.7026049541338664
engaging animal in all literature. This is not only a compliment to    1.6432600607208703
Mijbil, of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings    1.6432600607208703
in the book, but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened    1.7269387314284994
otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London, then by train    1.6432600607208703
(where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap)    1.67495327387791
to Camusfearna, with affectionate detail.   Mij, as his owner    1.5127085093302464
was soon to learn, had strange, inexplicable habits. He liked to nip    1.6432600607208703
ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth. He preferred    1.6065767145351917
sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow. Systematically he    1.6065767145351917
would open and ransack drawers. Given a small ball or marbles, he would    1.67495327387791
invent games and play by himself for hours. With curiosity and elan,    1.6432600607208703
he explored every inch of glen, beach and burn, once stranding himself    1.6432600607208703
for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting    1.67495327387791
with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell, who nearly lost his life    1.67495327387791
in doing so.   A year and a day of this idyll is described for the    1.7269387314284994
reader, one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality    1.67495327387791
is charted, but self-discovery as well. In the solitude of Camusfearna    1.6065767145351917
there had been no loneliness. "To be quite alone where there    1.6065767145351917
are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as though some    1.67495327387791
pressure had suddenly been lifted, allowing an intense awareness **h    1.5636360329510388
a sharpening of the senses".   Now, with the increasing interdependence    1.5636360329510388
between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need,    1.6065767145351917
that of being trusted implicitly by some creature. Two other people    1.6065767145351917
in time shared Mijbil's love: "**h it remained around us three    1.6065767145351917
that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable    1.67495327387791
world of wave and water **h; we were his Trinity, and he behaved    1.67495327387791
towards us **h with a mixture of trust and abuse, passion and irritation.    1.67495327387791
In turn each of us in our own way depended, as gods do, upon his    1.7269387314284994
worship".   1.0
Yet the idyll ended. The brief details of Mijbil's    1.5127085093302464
death lend depth to the story, give it an edge of ironic tragedy.    1.67495327387791
Man, to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty, was responsible    1.6065767145351917
in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract    1.7269387314284994
symbol of the savage in man. But then, through a strange coincidence,    1.6432600607208703
Maxwell manages to acquire Idal, a female otter, and the fascinating    1.6065767145351917
story starts once more.   One is not sure who emerges as    1.6065767145351917
the main personality of this book- Mijbil, with his rollicking ways,    1.6065767145351917
or Maxwell himself, poet, portrait painter, writer, journalist, traveller    1.5127085093302464
and zoologist, sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an    1.5127085093302464
unusual way of life, in a language at once lyrical and forceful, vivid    1.67495327387791
and unabashed. This reviewer read the book when it was first brought    1.6432600607208703
out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement. Now Gavin    1.6432600607208703
Maxwell's ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world.    1.6065767145351917
_NEW YORK_- The performances of the Comedie Francaise are the    1.5636360329510388
most important recent events in the New York theater.   They    1.5636360329510388
serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats,    1.6065767145351917
as accurately as possible, the techniques of acting the classics that    1.6065767145351917
prevailed in the 17th century. On the contrary, the old plays are continually    1.67495327387791
being reinterpreted, and each new production of a classic has    1.5636360329510388
only a brief history at the Comedie.   Of course, the well-received    1.6065767145351917
revivals last longer than the others, and that further reminds    1.5636360329510388
us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism. The directors of    1.6432600607208703
the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient    1.67495327387791
a manner as the Broadway producers who, in two instances this    1.6065767145351917
season, closed their plays after one performance. But they are aware    1.6065767145351917
of the world outside, they court public approval, they delight in full    1.6432600607208703
houses, and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic    1.6065767145351917
classic.   In France, novel approaches to the classic French    1.5127085093302464
plays are frequently attempted. The government pays a subsidy    1.5127085093302464
for revival of the classics, and this policy attracts experimenters who    1.6065767145351917
sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve    1.5636360329510388
interesting results.   So far as I know, the Comedie has never    1.6065767145351917
put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century, but    1.6065767145351917
they do reinterpret plays and characters. Last season, the Comedie's    1.5636360329510388
two principal experiments came to grief, and, in consequence, we can    1.6065767145351917
expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's "Phedre"    1.6065767145351917
and Moliere's "School for Wives".   The new    1.3761581156320553
"Phedre" was done in 17th century setting, instead of ancient Greek;    1.6065767145351917
perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this    1.5127085093302464
play's characters into our own time. The speaking of the lines seemed    1.6432600607208703
excessively slow and stately, possibly in an effort to capture the    1.6065767145351917
spirit of 17th century elegance. A few literary men defended what they    1.6432600607208703
took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama, but    1.7269387314284994
the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.   The new "School    1.6065767145351917
for Wives" was interpreted according to a principle that    1.5127085093302464
is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy- the    1.6065767145351917
idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.   1.6065767145351917
Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago, Louis    1.5127085093302464
Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns, while Fernand Ledoux,    1.6065767145351917
often performing at the Comedie, made them more gross than Moliere may    1.6432600607208703
have intended.   Apparently, Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just    1.4513752902486308
these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in "The School    1.6065767145351917
for Wives". I say "apparently" although I saw Jouvet as    1.5636360329510388
Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death; by    1.6065767145351917
that time, he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments    1.7026049541338664
of the comedy.   Arnolphe, it will be recalled, is a man    1.6065767145351917
of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be.    1.67495327387791
The part can lend itself to serious treatment; one influential    1.5636360329510388
French critic remarked: "Pity for Arnolphe comes with age".   1.5127085093302464
Accordingly, at the Comedie last year, Jean Meyer played    1.5127085093302464
a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into    1.6065767145351917
a tragedy. But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the    1.67495327387791
play became only comedy acted rather slowly.   Wisely, the Comedie    1.5636360329510388
has brought Moliere's "Tartuffe" on its tour and has left    1.5636360329510388
"The School for Wives" at home. Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite    1.6065767145351917
who courts his benefactor's wife. Jouvet played him as a sincere    1.6065767145351917
zealot, and Ledoux, at the Comedie, made him a gross buffoon, or    1.6432600607208703
so the historians tell us.   Louis Seigner, who formerly played    1.5636360329510388
the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux, is the Tartuffe of the present    1.6065767145351917
production, which he himself directed. His Tartuffe observes the    1.5127085093302464
golden mean. His red face, his coarse gestures, and his lustful stares    1.6432600607208703
bespeak his sensuality. But his heavenward glances and his pious    1.5636360329510388
speeches are not merely perfunctory; of course, they do not reflect    1.6065767145351917
sincerity, but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his    1.7026049541338664
pious impersonation.   Occasionally, Seigner draws some justly    1.3761581156320553
deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another. The    1.6432600607208703
whole role, by the way, is a considerable transformation for anyone    1.6065767145351917
who has seen Seigner in his other parts. His normal specialty is playing    1.67495327387791
the good-natured old man, frequently stupid or deluded but never    1.5636360329510388
mean or sly. Here, he is, quite persuasively, the very embodiment of    1.6432600607208703
meanness and slyness.   Seigner is the dean of the company, the    1.6065767145351917
oldest actor in point of continuous service. In that function, he helps    1.6432600607208703
to rebut another legend about the Comedie. We are often told that    1.6432600607208703
the Comedie has, unfortunately, life-contracts with old actors who    1.5127085093302464
are both mediocre and lazy, drawing their pay without much acting but    1.6432600607208703
probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage.    1.6432600607208703
Seigner, however, is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the    1.67495327387791
company; among his other parts are the leads in "The Bourgeois    1.6065767145351917
Gentleman" and "The Imaginary Invalid".   In Moliere's    1.3761581156320553
farce, "The Tricks of Scapin", Robert Hirsch undertakes    1.4513752902486308
another of the great roles. Here some innovation is attempted.    1.5636360329510388
To begin with, Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever    1.7026049541338664
servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master. Hirsch's    1.6065767145351917
Scapin is healthy, cheerful, energetic, revelling in his physical    1.5127085093302464
agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he    1.6065767145351917
serves.   Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities    1.6065767145351917
he has observed in the city toughs of the real world. And surely    1.67495327387791
his Scapin has a fresh directness, a no-nonsense quality that seems to    1.6432600607208703
make him his own master and nobody's servant.   1.4513752902486308
DJANGO REINHARDT, the ill-fated gypsy, was a true artist,    1.5127085093302464
one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and    1.6432600607208703
flow into many channels.   There is hardly a jazz guitarist in    1.6065767145351917
the business today who doesn't owe something to Django. And Django    1.6065767145351917
owed much to Louis Armstrong. He told once of how he switched his    1.67495327387791
style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records    1.6432600607208703
he bought in the Flea Market in Paris. It was the first jazz he    1.7026049541338664
had heard.   Django, who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in    1.5636360329510388
Belgium and who died in 1953 in France, was an extraordinary man. Most    1.67495327387791
of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep    1.7026049541338664
with a cigarette. And this was before he began to play his startlingly    1.67495327387791
beautiful jazz.   You can catch up with him- if you haven't    1.6065767145351917
already- on ~RCA-Victor's album. "Djangology", made    1.2818970554302986
up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of    1.6432600607208703
the Hot Club of France. This is a choice item and Grappely deserves    1.67495327387791
mention too, of course. He is one of the few men in history who    1.7026049541338664
plays jazz on a violin.   They play: "Minor Swing", "Honeysuckle    1.5636360329510388
Rose", "Beyond the Sea", "Bricktop", "Heavy    1.2818970554302986
Artillery", "Djangology", "After You've Gone", "Where    1.2818970554302986
Are You, My Love"? "I Saw Stars", "Lover Man",    1.5127085093302464
"Menilmontant" and "Swing 42".   All this is great    1.4513752902486308
proceedings- get the minutes.   Kid Ory, the trombonist chicken    1.5127085093302464
farmer, is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz. He dates    1.67495327387791
back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans.    1.67495327387791
His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years    1.67495327387791
than he cares to remember.   Good Time Jazz has released a nice    1.6432600607208703
two-record album which he made. He is starred against Alvin Alcorn,    1.6065767145351917
trumpet; Phil Gomez, clarinet; Cedric Haywood, piano; Julian    1.4513752902486308
Davidson, guitar; Wellman Braud, bass, and Minor Hall, drums.   1.5127085093302464
The set contains "High Society", "Do What Ory    1.4513752902486308
Say", "Down Home Rag", "Careless Love", Jazz Me Blues",    1.5127085093302464
"Weary Blues", "Original Dixieland One-Step", "Bourbon    1.2818970554302986
Street Parade", "Panama", "Toot, Toot, Tootsie",    1.2818970554302986
"Oh Didn't He Ramble", "Beale Street Blues", "Maryland,    1.4513752902486308
My Maryland", "1919 Rag", "Eh, La Bas", "Mood    1.4513752902486308
Indigo", and "Bugle Call Rag".   All this will serve    1.5127085093302464
to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those    1.7269387314284994
who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late    1.7026049541338664
to lay hands on the gems.   1.2818970554302986
MISCHA ELMAN shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert    1.4513752902486308
with three American composers.   His portion of the program-    1.5127085093302464
and a big portion it was- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century    1.6432600607208703
concertos for the violin: to wit, the Mendelssohn and the    1.5636360329510388
Tchaikovsky. That is an evening of music-making that would faze many    1.6065767145351917
a younger man; Mr& Elman is 70 years old.   There were    1.6065767145351917
8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they    1.6432600607208703
heard Elman. But, with all due respects and allowances, it must    1.6065767145351917
truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet,    1.6432600607208703
more mannered than musical. The occasion was sentimental; so was the    1.6065767145351917
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul    1.5127085093302464
Creston's Dance Overture, William Schuman's "Chester"    1.2818970554302986
from "New England Triptych" and two works of Wallingford Riegger,    1.5636360329510388
Dance Rhythms,    1.0
Op& 58, and a Romanza for Strings, Op&    1.4513752902486308
56~A.   1.0
The Creston is purely a potboiler, with Spanish, English,    1.5127085093302464
French and American dances mixed into the stew. The Riegger,    1.5636360329510388
with its Latin hesitation bounce, is just this side of the pale;    1.6432600607208703
like his sweet, attractive Romanza, it belongs to what the composer    1.6065767145351917
called his "Non-Dissonant (Mostly)" category of works. The Schuman    1.5127085093302464
"Chester" takes off from an old William Billings tune with    1.5636360329510388
All these- potboilers    1.0
or no- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively,    1.7026049541338664
colorful, unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors. It    1.5636360329510388
was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change. We have    1.67495327387791
Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well    1.6432600607208703
as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony.   1.4513752902486308
A WOMAN who undergoes artificial insemination against the    1.4513752902486308
wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of "A Question of Adultery",    1.67495327387791
yesterday's new British import at the Apollo.    1.3761581156320553
Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation    1.67495327387791
that would often arise, the film's extensive discussion of the    1.5636360329510388
problem seems, at best, superfluous. In its present artless, low-budget    1.5636360329510388
form, the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath.   1.5636360329510388
With Julie London enacting the central role with husky-voiced    1.5127085093302464
sincerity, the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive. The explanation    1.5636360329510388
offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage    1.6432600607208703
to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile    1.6432600607208703
accident.   Anthony Steel, as the husband, is a jealous type    1.5636360329510388
who argues against her course and sues for divorce, labeling her action    1.6432600607208703
adulterous. The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction    1.6065767145351917
of Don Chaffey, as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father    1.6065767145351917
and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander.   After a protracted,    1.5636360329510388
hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language    1.6065767145351917
than for dramatic credibility, the jury, to no one's surprise,    1.5636360329510388
leaves the legal question unresolved. When the husband drops the case    1.6065767145351917
and returns to his wife, both seem sorry they brought the matter up in    1.7026049541338664
the first place. So was the audience.    1.3761581156320553
_LONDON, JULY 4_- For its final change of bill in its London season,    1.67495327387791
the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one    1.5636360329510388
of those choreographic miscellanies known as a "gala program" at the    1.6065767145351917
Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. No doubt the underlying idea    1.5636360329510388
was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished    1.67495327387791
its presentations thus far, it too could give a circus if it pleased.   1.67495327387791
And please it did, in every sense of the word, for it had    1.67495327387791
the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical    1.67495327387791
of London audiences. At the end of the program, indeed, there was a    1.67495327387791
demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes, and nothing could stop    1.5636360329510388
it. Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic    1.2818970554302986
technical bit from the closing number, "Taras Bulba", but even    1.5636360329510388
then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined    1.6065767145351917
not to go home at all. Only a plea from the house manager, John Collins,    1.7269387314284994
But for all the manifest    1.1606783668269585
intention to "show off", this was a circus with a difference, for    1.6432600607208703
instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level,    1.67495327387791
it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company.   1.7026049541338664
The "Taras Bulba" excerpt is a rousing version of    1.5127085093302464
Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music    1.5127085093302464
of Soloviev-Sedoi. It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women,    1.6432600607208703
and it contains everything in the books- lusty comedy, gregarious    1.5636360329510388
cavorting, and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt    1.5636360329510388
to make the human body perform. Yuri Soloviev, Oleg Sokolov, Alexei    1.6065767145351917
Zhitkov, Lev Sokolov, Yuri Korneyev and Mr& Livshitz were the    1.5636360329510388
At    1.0
the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus    1.6432600607208703
ballet "Bayaderka", which opened the evening. What    1.3761581156320553
a man this Petipa was! And why do we in the West know so few of    1.748515906000203
his ballets? This scene is a "white ballet" in which a lovelorn    1.6432600607208703
hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily    1.5636360329510388
beautiful "shadows" who can all dance like nothing human-    1.5127085093302464
which, of course, is altogether fitting. The ensemble enters    1.5127085093302464
in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty, as well as loveliness,    1.7026049541338664
Its    1.0
ballerina, Olga Moiseyeva, performs simple miracles of beauty, and    1.5127085093302464
Ludmilla Alexeyeva, Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make    1.4513752902486308
up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments. Sergei Vikulov, as the    1.5636360329510388
lone male, meets the competition well with some brilliant hits, but the    1.6432600607208703
work is designed to belong to the ladies.   The middle section    1.6065767145351917
of the program was made up of short numbers, naturally enough of unequal    1.67495327387791
merit, but all of them pretty good at that. They consisted of a new    1.7026049541338664
arrangement of "Nutcracker" excerpts danced stunningly by Irina    1.4513752902486308
Kolpakova and Mr& Sokolev, with a large ensemble; a winning    1.5636360329510388
little "Snow Maiden" variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva;    1.5127085093302464
two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils (and superb esthetic    1.6065767145351917
acrobacy) by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna    1.6432600607208703
Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other; an amusing character    1.5636360329510388
pas de cinq called "Gossiping Women"; a stirring "Flames    1.5127085093302464
of Paris" pas de deux by Xenia Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky,    1.6065767145351917
and a lovely version of Fokine's "Le Cygne" by Olga    1.5636360329510388
Moiseyeva, which had to be repeated.   Vadim Kalentiev was the    1.5636360329510388
conductor.   It was quite an evening!   1.2818970554302986
A YEAR ago today, when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking    1.6065767145351917
in Los Angeles and John F& Kennedy was still only an    1.6065767145351917
able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility    1.6065767145351917
of the Presidency, Theodore H& White had already compiled masses    1.5636360329510388
of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960.   As the    1.5636360329510388
pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated, Mr&    1.5127085093302464
White took more notes. He traveled alternately with Mr& Kennedy    1.5636360329510388
and with Richard M& Nixon.   He asked intimate questions    1.5127085093302464
and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates'    1.67495327387791
"in-groups". He assembled quantities of facts about the nature    1.5127085093302464
of American politics in general, as well as about the day-to-day course    1.6432600607208703
of the closest Presidential election in American history.   1.4513752902486308
Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about    1.7269387314284994
that election; how little we know of what there is to be known is    1.7026049541338664
made humiliatingly clear by Mr& White in "The Making of the President    1.6432600607208703
1960".   This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly    1.5127085093302464
interesting one. What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism    1.5636360329510388
turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history. Mr&    1.5636360329510388
White, who is only a competent novelist, is a brilliant reporter. His    1.6432600607208703
zest for specific detail, his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere,    1.5127085093302464
his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the    1.6432600607208703
effectiveness of his book.    1.0
As a dramatic    1.0
narrative "The Making of the President 1960" is continuously    1.5127085093302464
engrossing. And as an introduction to American politics it is highly    1.6065767145351917
educational.   1.0
The author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy, his family and his entourage waiting for the returns.    1.5636360329510388
He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential    1.6432600607208703
hopefuls: five Democrats- Senator Hubert H& Humphrey,    1.3761581156320553
Senator Stuart Symington, Senator Lyndon B& Johnson, Adlai    1.4513752902486308
E& Stevenson and Mr& Kennedy- and two Republicans- Governor    1.5127085093302464
Rockefeller and Mr& Nixon.   Then, in chronological    1.3761581156320553
order, Mr& White covers the primary campaigns, the conventions and    1.5636360329510388
the Presidential campaign itself. In the process he writes at length    1.6065767145351917
about many related matters: the importance of race, religion, local    1.5636360329510388
tradition, bosses, organizations, zealous volunteers and television.    1.3761581156320553
Mr& White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions. He frequently    1.6065767145351917
cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's    1.6065767145351917
mouth, from numerous insiders and from Mr& Kennedy himself; but    1.5636360329510388
never from Mr& Nixon, who looked on reporters with suspicion and    1.6065767145351917
distrust.   "Rarely in American history has there been a political    1.5636360329510388
campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less",    1.5127085093302464
says Mr& White. Mr& Nixon, he believes, has no particular political    1.6065767145351917
philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign. Although a skillful    1.5127085093302464
politician and a courageous and honest man, Mr& Nixon, Mr& White    1.6065767145351917
believes, ignored his own top-level planners, wasted time and effort    1.5636360329510388
in the wrong regions, missed opportunities through indecision and    1.5127085093302464
damaged his chances on television.   Mr& Nixon is "a broody,    1.5636360329510388
moody man, given to long stretches of introspection; he trusts only    1.6065767145351917
himself and his wife. **h He is a man of major talent- but a man    1.7269387314284994
of solitary, uncertain impulses. **h He was above all a friend seeker,    1.6432600607208703
almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked. He wanted to identify    1.6432600607208703
with people and have a connection with them; **h the least inspiring    1.6432600607208703
candidate since Alfred M& Landon".   Mr& Kennedy,    1.3761581156320553
Mr& White believes, "had mastered politics on so many different    1.5636360329510388
levels that no other    1.0
American could match him". Calm, dignified, composed,    1.3761581156320553
"superbly eloquent", Mr& Kennedy always knew everything    1.3761581156320553
about everybody. He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous    1.67495327387791
volunteers. Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds.    1.5127085093302464
Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance. Mr& Kennedy    1.6065767145351917
did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters.    1.5636360329510388
Mr& White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a    1.67495327387791
Democrat himself who expects Mr& Kennedy to be a fine President.    1.6065767145351917
Throughout "The Making of a President"    1.2818970554302986
Mr& White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on    1.6065767145351917
candidates, how decisions have constantly to be made, how fatigue and    1.6065767145351917
illness and nervous strain wear candidates down, how subordinates play    1.5636360329510388
key roles. And he makes many interesting comments. Here are several:   1.6065767145351917
"The root question in American politics is always:    1.4513752902486308
Who's the Man to See? To understand American politics is, simply,    1.6065767145351917
to know people, to know the relative weight of names- who are    1.6432600607208703
heroes, who are straw men, who controls, who does not. But to operate    1.67495327387791
in American politics one must go a step further- one must build a    1.67495327387791
bridge to such names, establish a warmth, a personal connection".   1.5636360329510388
"In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform    1.67495327387791
nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose    1.6432600607208703
beyond expressing emotion".   "All platforms are meaningless:    1.3761581156320553
the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience    1.67495327387791
of the candidate the party chooses to lead it".   1.5127085093302464
NOSTALGIA WEEK at Lewisohn Stadium, which had begun with    1.5127085093302464
the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night,    1.5636360329510388
continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an    1.67495327387791
evening of French operatic excerpts.   Miss Pons is certainly    1.5127085093302464
not    1.0
70-no singer ever is- and yet the rewards of the evening again    1.6432600607208703
lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in    1.7269387314284994
present accomplishments. The better part of gallantry might be, perhaps,    1.5636360329510388
to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown,    1.6065767145351917
and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which    1.7026049541338664
she had chosen to sing.   No orchestra, however, could be expected    1.6065767145351917
to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as    1.6432600607208703
Miss Pons encountered last night. In all fairness, there were flashes    1.6065767145351917
of the great stylist of yesteryear, flashes even of the old consummate    1.6432600607208703
One such moment came in the breathtaking way    1.4513752902486308
Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's "Shadow Song".    1.5127085093302464
The years suddenly fell away at this point. On the whole, however, one    1.67495327387791
must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch    1.7026049541338664
her own reputation as time marches inexorably on.   Sharing    1.5127085093302464
the program was the young French-Canadian tenor Richard Verreau,    1.5127085093302464
making his stadium debut on this occasion. Mr& Verreau began shakily,    1.6065767145351917
with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed    1.6065767145351917
beyond middle volume. Later on this problem vanished, and the "Flower    1.6065767145351917
Song" from Bizet's "Carmen" was beautifully and intelligently    1.4513752902486308
projected.   1.0
Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach    1.5636360329510388
the minority listener. Lower costs and a larger number of stations    1.6065767145351917
are the key factors making such specialization possible.   The    1.5127085093302464
mushrooming of ~FM outlets, offering concerts (both jazz and classical),    1.5636360329510388
lectures, and other special events, is a phenomenon which has had    1.6065767145351917
a fair amount of publicity.   Not so well known is the growth    1.6432600607208703
of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners-    1.5636360329510388
an audience which, in the United States, comprises some 19,000,000    1.5636360329510388
people with $20,000,000,000 to spend each year.   Of course,    1.5127085093302464
the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching. He even    1.6065767145351917
buys a lot of the products he sees advertised- despite the fact that    1.67495327387791
the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any    1.7026049541338664
but white models in commercials.   But the growing number of    1.5636360329510388
Negro-appeal radio stations, plus evidence of strong listener support    1.5127085093302464
of their advertisers, give time salesmen an impressive argument as they    1.6065767145351917
approach new prospects. It is estimated that more than 600 stations    1.6065767145351917
(of a total of 3,400) do a significant amount of programing for the    1.67495327387791
Negro. At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this    1.67495327387791
audience in about half of the 50 states.   These and other figures    1.6432600607208703
and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor    1.6065767145351917
magazine, a trade publication for radio and ~TV advertisers. For    1.5636360329510388
10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics    1.67495327387791
of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching    1.5636360329510388
this market through radio.   In the past 10 years, Sponsor    1.5636360329510388
observes, these trends have become apparent: _@_ Negro population    1.4513752902486308
in the U&S& has increased 25 per cent while the white population    1.6432600607208703
was growing by 18 per cent. "The forgotten 15 million"- as    1.6065767145351917
Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey- has become    1.6065767145351917
a better-remembered 19 million. _@_ Advertisers are changing their    1.4513752902486308
attitudes, both as to the significance of this market and the ways    1.6432600607208703
of speaking to it. _@_ Stations programing to Negro listeners    1.5127085093302464
are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational,    1.7026049541338664
economic, and cultural levels. Futhermore, the station which    1.4513752902486308
wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement    1.5636360329510388
projects, not simply serve on the air.   In the last decade    1.6065767145351917
the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15    1.6432600607208703
per cent, and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per    1.6432600607208703
cent, according to a research man quoted by Sponsor.   A year    1.6065767145351917
ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which    1.6065767145351917
the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business.   1.6065767145351917
The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population    1.5636360329510388
growth. It also brought home proof of something a casual observer    1.6065767145351917
might have missed: that more than half of the U&S& Negroes live    1.6432600607208703
outside the southeastern states. Also, the state with the largest    1.5636360329510388
number of Negroes is New York- not in the South at all.    1.6432600607208703
In New York City, ~WLIB boasts "more community service programs    1.5636360329510388
than any other Negro station" and "one of the largest Negro    1.6065767145351917
news staffs in America". And ~WWRL's colorful mobile unit,    1.5127085093302464
cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods, is a frequent reminder    1.4513752902486308
of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests.    1.4513752902486308
Recently, ~WWRL won praise for its expose of particular cases    1.5636360329510388
of employment agency deceit. A half-dozen other stations in the New    1.6065767145351917
York area also bid for attention of the city's Negro population,    1.6065767145351917
up about 50 per cent in the past decade.   In all big cities outside    1.7026049541338664
the South, and even in small towns within the South, radio stations    1.6432600607208703
can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners.    1.67495327387791
The Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro network includes    1.3761581156320553
360 affiliated stations, whose signals reach more than half the total    1.6065767145351917
U&S& Negro population.   One question which inevitably    1.3761581156320553
crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the    1.7026049541338664
Negro is moving into a fully integrated status.   Whatever the    1.5636360329510388
long-range impact of integration, the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations    1.5636360329510388
these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal. Advertisers    1.67495327387791
have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names    1.6065767145351917
they have heard on stations catering to their special interests.    1.5636360329510388
And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro    1.67495327387791
disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words, working only    1.6065767145351917
from a fact sheet.   What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from    1.5636360329510388
other radio shows? Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular    1.5636360329510388
Negro bands and singers; rhythm-and-blues mood music; "race"    1.4513752902486308
music, folk songs and melodies, and gospel programs. Furthermore, news    1.5636360329510388
and special presentations inform the listener about groups, projects,    1.5127085093302464
and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station. Advertising    1.5127085093302464
copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro    1.5127085093302464
concern.   Sponsor quotes John McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony    1.4513752902486308
station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious    1.6065767145351917
of quality and and "does not wish to be associated with radio    1.6432600607208703
which is any way degrading to his race; he tends to shy away from the    1.7269387314284994
hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio    1.5127085093302464
programs famous".   The sociological impact is perhaps most    1.4513752902486308
eloquently summed up in this quotation of J& Walter Carroll of ~KSAN,    1.6432600607208703
San Francisco:   "Negro-appeal radio is more important    1.3761581156320553
to the Negro today, because it provides a direct and powerful    1.6065767145351917
mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions, achievements    1.6432600607208703
and desires. It will continue to be important as a means of orientation    1.67495327387791
to the Negro, seeking to become urbanized, as he tries to make    1.6432600607208703
adjustment to the urban life. Negro radio is vitally necessary during    1.6065767145351917
the process of assimilation".   1.0
Presentation of "The Life and Times of John Sloan" in    1.5636360329510388
the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human    1.6065767145351917
values in art.   Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large    1.67495327387791
and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow, Helen Farr    1.5636360329510388
Sloan, to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, the exhibition    1.6065767145351917
presents a survey of Sloan's work. From early family portraits,    1.5636360329510388
painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of    1.6065767145351917
the Fine Arts, the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed    1.6432600607208703
in his last year (1951) and still part of his estate.   Few    1.6432600607208703
artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they    1.7026049541338664
lived. Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with    1.67495327387791
so little bitterness. The paintings, drawings, prints, and illustrations    1.5127085093302464
all reflect the manners, costumes, and mores of America in the first    1.6432600607208703
half of the present century.   Obviously Sloan's early years    1.5127085093302464
were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri. As early as    1.6065767145351917
1928, however, the Sloan style began to change. The dark pigments of    1.6432600607208703
the early work were superseded by a brighter palette. The solidity of    1.6432600607208703
brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual    1.6432600607208703
abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies    1.5636360329510388
and studio nudes.   The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's    1.5636360329510388
many-sided art. In addition to the paintings are drawings, prints,    1.5636360329510388
and illustrations. Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements    1.5127085093302464
before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the    1.7026049541338664
streets of New York, thereby building for America an incomparable    1.5636360329510388
city survey from paintings of McSorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines    1.5636360329510388
on city roofs.   One of the most appealing of the rooftop    1.6065767145351917
canvases is "Sun and Wind on the Roof", with a woman and child    1.67495327387791
bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds. Although    1.5127085093302464
there are landscapes in the show (one of the strongest is a vista of    1.7026049541338664
"Gloucester Harbor" in 1915), the human element was the compelling    1.5636360329510388
factor in Sloan's art.   Significant are such canvases as    1.5127085093302464
"Bleeker Street, Saturday Night", with its typically American    1.4513752902486308
crowd (Sloan never went abroad); the multifigure "Traveling Carnival",    1.5127085093302464
in which action is vivified by lighting; or "Carmine    1.5127085093302464
Theater, 1912", the only canvas with an ash can (and foraging dog),    1.6432600607208703
although Sloan was a member of the famous "Eight", and of the    1.6432600607208703
so-called "Ash-Can School", a term he resented.   Not all    1.5127085093302464
the paintings, however, are of cities. The exhibition touches briefly    1.5636360329510388
on his sojourn in the Southwest ("Koshare in the Dust", a vigorous    1.6432600607208703
Indian dance, and landscapes suggest the influence of western    1.5127085093302464
color on his palette).   The fact that Sloan was an extrovert,    1.6065767145351917
concerned primarily with what he saw, adds greatly to the value of his    1.67495327387791
art as a human chronicle.   There are 151 items in the Wilmington    1.6432600607208703
show, including one painting by each member of the "Eight",    1.5636360329510388
as well as work by Sloan's friends and students. Supplementing the    1.6065767145351917
actual art are memorabilia- correspondence, diaries, books from the    1.5127085093302464
artist's library, etc&. All belong to the collection being given    1.5636360329510388
to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs& Sloan, who has cherished    1.67495327387791
such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at    1.6065767145351917
the Art Students League, New York, in the 1920's.   To    1.5636360329510388
enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries, the Delaware    1.6065767145351917
Art Center (according to its director, Bruce St& John) will maintain    1.6065767145351917
a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works, as well as    1.6432600607208703
a card index file. The entire Sloan collection will be made available    1.6432600607208703
at the center to all serious art students and historians.   The    1.6065767145351917
current exhibition, which remains on view through Oct& 29, has tapped    1.6065767145351917
14 major collections and many private sources.   1.3761581156320553
Any musician playing Beethoven here, where Beethoven was born,    1.5127085093302464
is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care. In    1.6065767145351917
a sense, he is offering Bonn what its famous son (who left as a youth)    1.7269387314284994
never did- the sound of the composer's mature style.   Robert    1.5636360329510388
Riefling, who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded    1.6065767145351917
23rd Beethoven Festival, penetrated deep into the spirit of the    1.5636360329510388
style.    1.0
His readings were careful without being fussy, and they were authoritative    1.6065767145351917
without being presumptuous. The 32 ~C minor Variations    1.4513752902486308
with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another,    1.6432600607208703
leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline.    1.4513752902486308
The ~D minor Sonata, Op& 31 No& 2, introduced by dynamically    1.6065767145351917
shaped arpeggios, was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative-    1.5636360329510388
single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way    1.6432600607208703
toward the idea to come. These inwardly dramatic moments showed the    1.6065767145351917
kind of "opera style" of which Beethoven was genuinely capable,    1.5636360329510388
but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging.    1.6432600607208703
Two late Sonatas, Op& 110 and 111, were played with similar insight,    1.6432600607208703
the disarming simplicities of the Op& 111 Adagio made plain without    1.6065767145351917
ever becoming obvious. The two were separated from each other by    1.6065767145351917
the Six Bagatelles of Op& 126. Herr Riefling, in everything he    1.6065767145351917
gave his large Beethoven Hall audience, proved himself as an interpreter    1.6065767145351917
of unobtrusive authority.   Volker Wangenheim, who conducted    1.3761581156320553
Bonn's Sta^dtisches    1.0
Orchester on the following evening, made    1.2818970554302986
one more conscious of the process of interpretation. Herr Wangenheim    1.5636360329510388
has only recently become the city's music director, and is a young    1.6432600607208703
man with a clear flair for the podium.   But he weighted the Eighth    1.67495327387791
Symphony, at times, with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed    1.5127085093302464
considerably at odds with the music. He might have been hoping, to all    1.67495327387791
appearances, that this relatively sunny symphony, in conjunction    1.4513752902486308
with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program, could amount    1.6432600607208703
to something like the Ninth; but no amount of head-tossing could    1.6065767145351917
make it so.   The conductor's preoccupation with the business    1.5127085093302464
of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness, as with the first    1.6065767145351917
orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto, but when he put    1.6065767145351917
his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed,    1.6432600607208703
it did so with plenty of spring.   The concerto's soloist,    1.5636360329510388
Hans Richter-Haaser, played with compensatory ease and economy, though    1.5127085093302464
without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on    1.6065767145351917
the previous evening by Herr Riefling. His was a burgomaster's    1.5636360329510388
Beethoven, solid and sensible.   Everybody returned after intermission    1.4513752902486308
for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy for Piano, Chorus,    1.5636360329510388
and Orchestra in ~C minor, made up by its composer to fill    1.6432600607208703
out one of his programs. The entrance of the Sta^dtisches Gesangverein    1.6065767145351917
(Bonn's civic chorus) was worth all the waiting, however, as the    1.6065767145351917
young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life.   The    1.5636360329510388
last program of this festival, which during two weeks had sampled most    1.6432600607208703
compositional categories, brought the Cologne Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester    1.2818970554302986
and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance    1.5127085093302464
of the Missa Solemnis.   1.0
A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray    1.67495327387791
resting on the backs of three giant elephants, which in turn stood    1.6432600607208703
on the shell of a great tortoise. This theory eventually proved inexact.    1.6432600607208703
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known    1.6432600607208703
bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science.   1.6432600607208703
It is the business of cosmologists, the scientists who    1.5127085093302464
study the nature and structure of the universe, to try to solve the great    1.7026049541338664
cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors.    1.6065767145351917
These keys are the working principles of physics, mathematics and astronomy,    1.6065767145351917
principles which are then extrapolated, or projected, to explain    1.5127085093302464
phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge.   In    1.6065767145351917
the autumn of 1959, the British Broadcasting Corporation presented    1.5127085093302464
a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology. Three    1.6065767145351917
of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other    1.6432600607208703
acted as a moderator. The participants were Professor H& Bondi,    1.5636360329510388
professor of mathematics at King's College, London; Dr& W&    1.5127085093302464
B& Bonnor, reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College,    1.5127085093302464
London; Dr& R& A& Lyttleton, a lecturer at St& John's    1.5636360329510388
College, Cambridge, and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the    1.5636360329510388
University of Cambridge; and Dr& G& J& Whitrow, reader    1.5127085093302464
in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology,    1.6065767145351917
London.   Dr& Whitrow functioned as moderator. The    1.3761581156320553
programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments    1.6432600607208703
have been published in a totally engrossing little book called, "Rival    1.6065767145351917
Theories of Cosmology".   Dr& Bonnor begins with    1.3761581156320553
a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe, based on    1.6065767145351917
the general theory of relativity. First of all, and this has been calculated    1.67495327387791
by observation, the universe is expanding- that is, the galaxies    1.5636360329510388
are receding from each other at immense speeds. Because of this    1.6065767145351917
Dr& Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated    1.6065767145351917
by stars and whatever else is there. This expansion has been going    1.6432600607208703
on for an estimated eight billion years.    1.3761581156320553
Dr& Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts,    1.6432600607208703
that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and    1.6065767145351917
reverse itself and that the contraction will set in. Then, after many    1.6432600607208703
more billions of years, when all the galaxies are whistling toward a    1.6432600607208703
common center, this movement will slow down and reverse itself again.   1.6065767145351917
Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory.    1.3761581156320553
He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually    1.6065767145351917
being created in space. For this reason, he says, the density    1.6065767145351917
of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are    1.6432600607208703
zooming away in all directions. New galaxies are forever being formed    1.6065767145351917
to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies.   If this    1.6432600607208703
is true, then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years    1.7026049541338664
ago and as it will look millions of years hence, even though the universe    1.7026049541338664
is expanding. For new galaxies to be created, Professor Bondi    1.5636360329510388
declares, it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be    1.67495327387791
created in an area the size of your living room once every few million    1.7026049541338664
years. He contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on    1.5636360329510388
which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because    1.6432600607208703
some slight error must be assumed in such experiments.   Dr&    1.5636360329510388
Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe    1.6065767145351917
and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons. Protons    1.6432600607208703
and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract    1.5636360329510388
each other, and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen-    1.7026049541338664
the basic building block of matter. The charges of the electron    1.6065767145351917
and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite, but Dr&    1.6432600607208703
Lyttleton is not so sure. Suppose, says Dr& Lyttleton, the proton    1.6065767145351917
has a slightly greater charge than the electron (so slight it is    1.6432600607208703
presently immeasurable). This would give the hydrogen atom a slight    1.5636360329510388
charge-excess.   1.0
Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface    1.5636360329510388
of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms, it would be subject both to the    1.7026049541338664
gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms    1.6065767145351917
in the sphere. Because electrical forces (the charge-excess) are far    1.5636360329510388
more powerful than gravitation, the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot    1.5636360329510388
away from the sphere.   Dr& Lyttleton then imagines the universe    1.5636360329510388
as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from    1.6065767145351917
it. This, he claims, would reasonably account for the expansion of the    1.6432600607208703
universe.    1.0
This slim book, while giving the    1.2818970554302986
reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the    1.6065767145351917
universe, has the appeal that informed conversation always has. Several    1.5636360329510388
photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with    1.6065767145351917
the discussion, and the smooth language indicates the contributors    1.5127085093302464
were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost    1.7026049541338664
every field.   It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists    1.5636360329510388
of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made    1.6065767145351917
satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up    1.6065767145351917
new vistas to science. Presently, the intense absorption of ultra-violet    1.5636360329510388
rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation.    1.5127085093302464
These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the    1.5636360329510388
earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic    1.6432600607208703
theories.   There would seem to be some small solace in    1.5636360329510388
the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time    1.67495327387791
accelerating the study of the space around us, giving us a long-sought    1.6432600607208703
ladder from which to peer at alien regions.   In doing away with    1.6432600607208703
the tea tray, the elephants and the giant tortoise, science has developed    1.6432600607208703
a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos.    1.5127085093302464
And although the universe may forever defy understanding, it might even    1.6065767145351917
now be finding its match in the imagination of man.    1.5636360329510388
"Roots", the new play at the brand-new Mayfair Theater on 46th    1.6065767145351917
St&    1.0
which has been made over from a night club, is about the intellectual    1.67495327387791
and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl. Highly successful    1.5636360329510388
in England before its transfer to New York, most of "Roots" is    1.6432600607208703
as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are    1.6432600607208703
gaudy.   Only in its final scene, where Beatie Bryant (Mary    1.5636360329510388
Doyle) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual    1.6065767145351917
lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile    1.6432600607208703
the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch    1.6065767145351917
for most of the first two and one-half acts.   The burden of Mr&    1.67495327387791
Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil (at least    1.6432600607208703
in England) are not the happy, fine, strong, natural, earthy people    1.6065767145351917
city-bred intellectuals imagine. Rather they are genuine clods, proud    1.5127085093302464
of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating    1.5127085093302464
influences of aesthetics or thought. They care no more for politics,    1.6065767145351917
says Mr& Wesker, than they do for a symphony. Seeming to have roots    1.67495327387791
in the soil, they actually have none in life. They dwell, in short,    1.67495327387791
in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are    1.67495327387791
commonly reported to have lived.   But this is a theme which does    1.6432600607208703
not take so much time to state as Mr& Wesker dedicates to it. So    1.7026049541338664
much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest    1.6065767145351917
of the theatergoer (unless he has been living in a gilded palace, perhaps,    1.67495327387791
and wants a real big heap of contrast). The messy meals, the washing    1.67495327387791
of dishes, the drying of clothes may be realism, but there is such    1.67495327387791
a thing as redundancy.   Now for the good points. Miss Doyle    1.6065767145351917
as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits, a strong voice and a    1.7026049541338664
warm smile. She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has    1.7026049541338664
become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie (we never do    1.6432600607208703
see him) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating,    1.7026049541338664
including a dose of good British socialism. But while she    1.5636360329510388
is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open    1.7269387314284994
before her, Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress, and    1.6432600607208703
instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull,    1.7269387314284994
he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal.   Beatie, getting    1.5127085093302464
no sympathy for her misfortune, soon rallies and finds that although she    1.6432600607208703
has lost a lover she has gained her freedom. Despite a too long sustained    1.7026049541338664
declamatory flight, this final speech is convincing, and we see    1.5636360329510388
why British audiences apparently were impressed by "Roots".   1.4513752902486308
There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play, including    1.6065767145351917
William Hansen's impersonation of a stubborn, rather pathetic    1.4513752902486308
father, and Katherine Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm    1.5127085093302464
mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter, or anyone    1.6065767145351917
else. But I am afraid Mr& Wesker's meat and potatoes dish    1.6065767145351917
isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences.   1.3761581156320553
SHAKESPEARE had a word for everything, even for the rain    1.5636360329510388
that disrupted Wednesday night's "Much Ado About Nothing" opening    1.5127085093302464
the season of free theatre in Central Park.   The New    1.5636360329510388
York Shakespeare Festival, which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating    1.5636360329510388
Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed,    1.5636360329510388
began bravely. Joseph Papp, impassioned founder of the festival and    1.5636360329510388
director of "Much Ado", had a vibrant, colorful production under    1.5636360329510388
way. Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with    1.6432600607208703
Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture.   The audience    1.4513752902486308
filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto    1.6065767145351917
the lawns outside the fence. The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick,    1.6432600607208703
so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult, raised    1.6432600607208703
chuckles. The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges, also    1.5127085093302464
familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of    1.7026049541338664
writers' heads, evoked laughter. The vivacity of the masquers'    1.5127085093302464
party at Leonato's palace, with the Spanish motif in the music and    1.6432600607208703
dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon, cast a spell of    1.67495327387791
As "Much Ado" turned serious while the insipid    1.4513752902486308
Claudio rejected Hero at the altar, a sprinkle began to fall. At    1.6432600607208703
first hardly a person in the audience moved, although some umbrellas    1.6065767145351917
were opened. But the rain came more heavily, and men and women in    1.67495327387791
light summer clothes began to depart. The grieving Hero and her father,    1.6432600607208703
Leonato, followed by the Friar, left the stage. A voice on the    1.6432600607208703
loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance    1.6065767145351917
would resume in ten minutes.   More than half the audience departed.    1.6065767145351917
Some remained in the Wollman enclosure, fortified with raincoats    1.5127085093302464
or with newspapers to cover their heads. Others huddled under the trees    1.6432600607208703
outside the fence. Twenty minutes after the interruption, although    1.5127085093302464
it was still raining, the play was resumed at the point in the fourth    1.7026049541338664
act where it had been stopped.   Beatrice (Nan Martin) and    1.5636360329510388
Benedick (J& D& Cannon) took their places on the stage. In their    1.6432600607208703
very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare, like a Nostradamus,    1.6065767145351917
had foreseen this moment.   Said Benedick: "Lady Beatrice,    1.4513752902486308
have you wept all this while"?   Replied Beatrice:    1.4513752902486308
"Yea, and I will weep a while longer".   The heavens refused    1.6065767145351917
to give up their weeping. The gallant company completed Act /4,    1.6065767145351917
and got through part of Act /5,. But the final scenes could not    1.67495327387791
be played. If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour    1.67495327387791
are in doubt about how it comes out, let them take comfort. "Much    1.67495327387791
The Parks Department has done an admirable    1.3761581156320553
job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare. One could    1.5636360329510388
hardly blame Newbold Morris, the Parks Commissioner, for devoting    1.5127085093302464
so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short    1.6065767145351917
notice provided the stage with its rising platforms, its balcony,    1.5636360329510388
its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the    1.67495327387791
villains.   Eldon Elder, who designed the stage, also created    1.5127085093302464
a gay, spacious set that blended attractively with the park background    1.6065767145351917
and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood. Mr& Papp has directed a    1.5127085093302464
performance that has verve and pace, although he has tolerated obvious    1.6065767145351917
business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style    1.6065767145351917
would be preferable.   1.0
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at    1.4513752902486308
Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints.    1.67495327387791
Still a demurrer or two must be entered.   Schwarzkopf is,    1.5636360329510388
of course, Schwarzkopf. For style and assurance, for a supreme and    1.6065767145351917
regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her. If the voice    1.7026049541338664
is just a shade less glorious than it used to be, it is still a beautiful    1.748515906000203
instrument, controlled and flexible. Put to the service of lieder    1.5636360329510388
of Schubert, Brahms, Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical    1.6065767145351917
way, it made its effect with ease and precision.   But what has    1.6432600607208703
been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism. Instead    1.5636360329510388
of her old confidence in the simplest, purest, most moving musical    1.6065767145351917
expression, Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic    1.6065767145351917
sin of artistic pride- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads    1.5636360329510388
a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the    1.67495327387791
music by bringing to it something extra, some personal dramatic touch    1.6065767145351917
imposed from the outside.   The symptoms Saturday night were    1.5127085093302464
unmistakable. Clever light songs were overly coy, tragic songs a little    1.6065767145351917
too melodramatic. There was an extra pause here, a gasp or a sigh    1.67495327387791
there, here and there an extra little twist of a word or note, all in    1.7269387314284994
the interest of effect. The result was like that of a beautiful painting    1.67495327387791
with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness.   1.67495327387791
There were stunning musical phrases too, and sometimes    1.4513752902486308
the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication.    1.5636360329510388
Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist, John Wustman, often achieved    1.5636360329510388
the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition. All the more    1.6065767145351917
reason why there should have been no place for the frills; Miss    1.6432600607208703
Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them.   1.5127085093302464
THE dance, dancers and dance enthusiasts (8,500 of them)    1.5127085093302464
had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night    1.67495327387791
than all had had two nights earlier, when Stadium Concerts presented    1.6065767145351917
the first of two dance programs.   On Saturday, the orchestra    1.5636360329510388
was sensibly situated down on the field, the stage floor was apparently    1.6432600607208703
in decent condition for dancing, and the order of the program improved.    1.6432600607208703
There was, additionally, a bonus for the Saturday-night    1.4513752902486308
patrons. Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first    1.6065767145351917
New York performance of Mr& Ailey's "Roots of the Blues",    1.5636360329510388
a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival.   1.67495327387791
Otherwise, the program included, as on Thursday, the    1.4513752902486308
Taras-Tchaikovsky "Design for Strings", the Dollar-Britten    1.2818970554302986
"Divertimento", the Dollar-De Banfield "The Duel" and    1.3761581156320553
the pas de deux from "The Nutcracker".   Maria Tallchief    1.5127085093302464
and Erik Bruhn, who danced the "Nutcracker" pas de deux, were    1.6065767145351917
also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from "Don Quixote",    1.6065767145351917
another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.   1.5127085093302464
Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening,    1.5127085093302464
Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in    1.5127085093302464
their roles in "The Duel", a work that depends so much upon the    1.67495327387791
precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants.   Mr&    1.5127085093302464
Ailey's "Roots of the Blues", an earthy and very human modern    1.6065767145351917
dance work, provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of    1.5636360329510388
As Brother John Sellers sang five "blues"    1.3761581156320553
to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep    1.6065767145351917
Shepard, Mr& Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile    1.5636360329510388
dances that were by turns insinuating, threatening, contemptuous and    1.5127085093302464
ecstatic.   Their props were two stepladders, a chair and a palm    1.6065767145351917
fan. He wore the clothes of a laborer, and she was wondrously seductive    1.67495327387791
in a yellow and orange dress.   The cat-like sinuousness    1.5127085093302464
and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps, lifts, crawls and    1.6432600607208703
slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong, sometimes    1.6432600607208703
almost frightening, tensions. "Roots of the Blues" may    1.4513752902486308
not be for gentle souls, but others should welcome its super-charged impact.   1.6432600607208703
"PERHAPS it is better to stay at home. The armchair traveler    1.6065767145351917
preserves his illusions". This somewhat cynical comment may    1.4513752902486308
be found in "Blue Skies, Brown Studies", a collection of travel    1.6065767145351917
essays by William Sansom, who would never consider staying home for    1.6065767145351917
long. Mr& Sansom is English, bearded, formidably cultivated, the    1.5127085093302464
versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories, of novels and    1.6065767145351917
of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something    1.6432600607208703
midway between.   The only man alive who seems qualified by    1.5636360329510388
his learning, his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance    1.6065767145351917
of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell,    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration    1.6065767145351917
worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of    1.67495327387791
a Hungarian beauty (her third) and an American multimillionaire (his    1.5636360329510388
fourth). The result is rather wonderful, but so rich as to be indigestible    1.67495327387791
if taken in too thick slices.   There are sixteen essays    1.5636360329510388
in "Blue Skies, Brown Studies". Most of them were written between    1.6065767145351917
1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines. All    1.5636360329510388
are well written and are overwritten. But, even if Mr& Sansom labors    1.6432600607208703
too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from    1.6065767145351917
his travel experiences than the limits of language allow, he still can    1.6432600607208703
charm and astound. Too many books and articles are just assembled by    1.6432600607208703
putting one word after another. Mr& Sansom actually <writes> his    1.5636360329510388
with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence, with an intense    1.6432600607208703
relish in all the metaphorical resources of English, with a thick shower    1.6432600607208703
of sophisticated, cultural references.    1.0
"I like to sniff a place, and reproduce what it really smells    1.6432600607208703
and looks like, its color, its particular kind of life". This is    1.6432600607208703
an exact description of what Mr& Sansom does. He ignores guidebook    1.6065767145351917
facts. He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches    1.6432600607208703
an individual or quotes his opinions. It is an over-all impression    1.6065767145351917
Mr& Sansom strives for, an impression compounded of visual details,    1.5636360329510388
of a savory mixture of smells, of much loving attention to architecture    1.6432600607208703
and scenery, of lights and shadows, of intangibles of atmosphere    1.5636360329510388
and of echoes of the past.   William Sansom writes only about    1.6065767145351917
Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London,    1.6432600607208703
Vienna, the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords. But no    1.5636360329510388
matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original    1.67495327387791
mind and his own sensitive reactions. "A writer lives, at best, in    1.6432600607208703
a state of astonishment", he says. "Beneath any feeling he has of    1.6432600607208703
the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it    1.748515906000203
all. To transmit that feeling he writes". This may not be true of    1.67495327387791
many writers, but it certainly is true of Mr& Sansom. So in these    1.67495327387791
pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St& Torpetius    1.67495327387791
that still persists in St& Tropez; at the sun and the    1.6065767145351917
heat of Mediterranean lands, always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman    1.6432600607208703
than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas    1.6432600607208703
City; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's    1.67495327387791
finest restaurants, La Bonne Auberge, which is situated on the seacoast    1.6065767145351917
twenty miles west of the Nice airport; and at the infinite variety    1.6432600607208703
of London.   Mr& Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular    1.5636360329510388
way which recalls (to those who recall easily) the statues of Bernini    1.6432600607208703
and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto. He can coin a neat phrase:    1.6432600607208703
"a street spattered with an invigoration of people"; tulips    1.5127085093302464
with "petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears"; after a    1.6065767145351917
snowstorm a landscape smelling "of woodsmoke and clarity". And, for    1.5636360329510388
all his lacquered, almost Byzantine self-consciousness, he can make    1.5127085093302464
one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison.    1.4513752902486308
In one of his best essays Mr& Sansom expresses    1.5127085093302464
his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio    1.6065767145351917
himself that dot the environs of Vicenza. How far that pedimented    1.6065767145351917
and pillared style has shed its influence Mr& Sansom reminds    1.5636360329510388
us thus:   "The white colonnaded, cedar-roofed Southern mansion    1.4513752902486308
is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England    1.6432600607208703
to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South,    1.6432600607208703
the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza: the old mind of    1.6065767145351917
Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair    1.6065767145351917
on a Southern porch, the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise    1.6432600607208703
firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen, his feeling for light    1.6432600607208703
and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep, his sense of columns    1.7026049541338664
framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple    1.6065767145351917
of mating lips". Nice, even if a trifle gaudy.   "Blue Skies,    1.6065767145351917
Brown Studies" is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs.   1.4513752902486308
IN recent days there have been extensive lamentations over    1.5127085093302464
the absence of original drama on television, but not for years have    1.6432600607208703
many regretted the passing of new plays on radio. ~WBAI, the listener-supported    1.6432600607208703
outlet on the frequency-modulation band, has decided    1.3761581156320553
to do what it can to correct this aural void. Yesterday it offered    1.67495327387791
"Poised for Violence", by Jean Reavey.   ~WBAI is on    1.5127085093302464
the right track: in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis    1.6432600607208703
on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre,    1.7026049541338664
as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue    1.4513752902486308
to demonstrate. Unfortunately, "Poised for Violence" was not    1.4513752902486308
Mrs&    1.0
Reavey's work is written for the stage- it is mentioned for an off-Broadway    1.67495327387791
production in the fall- and, in addition, employs an avant-garde    1.5636360329510388
structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension    1.5127085093302464
is to be encouraged.   The play's device is to explore society's    1.6065767145351917
obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group    1.6065767145351917
of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting    1.5636360329510388
rather than just be themselves. In a succession of scenes they appear    1.6432600607208703
in different guises- patrons of a cafe, performers in a circus and    1.6432600607208703
participants in a family picnic- but in each instance they inevitably    1.6065767145351917
Somewhere in Mrs& Reavey's    1.0
play there is both protest and aspiration of merit. But its relentless    1.6432600607208703
discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that    1.4513752902486308
after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt. Moreover,    1.67495327387791
her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous    1.5127085093302464
assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own    1.6065767145351917
right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills.   But quite    1.6065767145351917
conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the    1.5127085093302464
work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve    1.7026049541338664
the burden on the author's words. Which in itself is an immediate    1.6432600607208703
reward of the ~WBAI experiment; good radio drama has its own    1.6065767145351917
special demands that badly need reinvigoration.   1.2818970554302986
A WEEKLY showcase for contemporary music, from the austere    1.5127085093302464
archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music,    1.6065767145351917
is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month.   Titled "What's    1.5127085093302464
New in Music"? the enterprising program is heard Saturday    1.5127085093302464
afternoons on radio station ~WQXR.   The brief notes    1.4513752902486308
introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points, and    1.5636360329510388
many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by    1.5636360329510388
the hand through an often difficult maze. The show is programed and    1.6432600607208703
written by the station's assistant continuity editor, Chuck Briefer.   1.5127085093302464
The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings.    1.6432600607208703
Last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch,    1.3761581156320553
Karlheinz Stockhausen, Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from    1.5127085093302464
a new "space" opera by the Swedish composer, Karl-Birger Blomdahl.   1.5636360329510388
Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American    1.5636360329510388
composer, a particular type of music or the music of a given    1.6432600607208703
country.   It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is    1.5636360329510388
set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene. But    1.6065767145351917
one wishes, when the appetite is whetted, as it was in the case of    1.7026049541338664
the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera, that further opportunity    1.5636360329510388
would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety    1.6065767145351917
and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.   1.7026049541338664
THE Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square    1.5127085093302464
Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before    1.6065767145351917
it brings its long American tour to a close.   It is not simply    1.67495327387791
giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York    1.6432600607208703
engagement earlier this season, but has brought back many of the numbers    1.6432600607208703
that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's    1.7269387314284994
heart.   It is good to see those numbers again. The "Suite    1.6065767145351917
of Old Russian Dances" that opened that inaugural program    1.5127085093302464
with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into    1.67495327387791
typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth; the amusing "Yurochka",    1.4513752902486308
in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance; the    1.6065767145351917
lovely (and of course vigorous) "Polyanka" or "The Meadow";    1.5127085093302464
the three Moldavian dances entitled "Zhok"; the sweet and funny    1.5636360329510388
little dance about potato planting called "Bul'ba"; and    1.4513752902486308
the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called "City    1.6432600607208703
Quadrille" are all just as good as one remembers them to have been,    1.67495327387791
and they are welcome back.   1.1606783668269585
So, for that matter, are the newer    1.3761581156320553
dances- the "Kalmuk Dance" with its animal movements, that genial    1.5636360329510388
juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called "The Platter", the    1.5127085093302464
rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called "Summer", "The    1.4513752902486308
Three Shepherds" of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs,    1.5127085093302464
and, of course, the trenchant "Rock 'n' Roll".    1.4513752902486308
As autumn starts its annual sweep, few Americans and Canadians realize    1.6065767145351917
how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring.    1.6065767145351917
Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire    1.6065767145351917
land surface of the earth. The only other regions so blessed are the    1.67495327387791
British Isles, western Europe, eastern China, southern Chile and    1.5127085093302464
parts of Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania. Their autumn tints are    1.6065767145351917
all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson, gold,    1.6432600607208703
purple, bronze, blue and vermilion that flame up in North America.    1.6065767145351917
Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle;    1.6065767145351917
in fact, a freezing autumn dulls the blaze. The best effects come    1.6432600607208703
from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain,    1.6065767145351917
followed by sunny days and cool nights. Foliage pilgrimages, either    1.5636360329510388
organized or individual, are becoming an autumn item for more and    1.6065767145351917
more Americans each year. Below is a specific guide, keyed to the calendar.    1.67495327387791
_CANADA._ Late September finds Quebec's    1.1606783668269585
color at its peak, especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area    1.67495327387791
south of the St& Lawrence River. In the Maritime provinces farther    1.6065767145351917
east, the tones are a little quieter. Ontario's foliage is most    1.6065767145351917
vivid from about Sept& 23 to Oct& 10, with both Muskoka (100    1.6432600607208703
miles north of Toronto) and Haliburton (125 miles northwest of Toronto)    1.6065767145351917
holding color cavalcades starting Sept& 23. In the Canadian    1.5127085093302464
Rockies, great groves of aspen are already glinting gold. _NEW ENGLAND._    1.6065767145351917
Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept& 25 to Oct&    1.5636360329510388
15, and often hit a height in early October. New Hampshire figures    1.6432600607208703
its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including    1.6432600607208703
the yellow of the birches. The shades tend to be a little softer    1.67495327387791
in the forests that blanket so much of Maine. In western Massachusetts    1.6432600607208703
and northwest Connecticut, the Berkshires are at their vibrant    1.5127085093302464
prime the first week of October.    1.2818970554302986
Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October, choice routes being    1.5127085093302464
9~N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake    1.7026049541338664
Placid area. Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color    1.7026049541338664
over the Catskills in mid-October, notably along routes 23 and 23~A.    1.6065767145351917
About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania    1.5636360329510388
are magnificent- Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival    1.5127085093302464
on Oct& 14, 15. New Jersey's color varies from staccato    1.5636360329510388
to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May. _SOUTHEAST._    1.7026049541338664
During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and    1.5636360329510388
other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from    1.5636360329510388
Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia. The most brilliant displays    1.5636360329510388
are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley    1.5127085093302464
and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee.    1.5636360329510388
_MIDWEST._ Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have many    1.3761581156320553
superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few    1.6432600607208703
days of September well into October, especially in their northern sections,    1.6065767145351917
<e&g&>, Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama    1.2818970554302986

of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie du Chien.    1.67495327387791
In Michigan, there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits,    1.7026049541338664
while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the    1.5636360329510388
Upper Peninsula are spectacular. In Minnesota, Arrowhead County    1.4513752902486308
and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding. Farther    1.5636360329510388
south, there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks, with some    1.67495327387791
seasonal peaks as late as early November. Illinois' Shawnee    1.5127085093302464

The Rockies have many "Aspencades", which are organized tours    1.5127085093302464
of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage points for viewing    1.6432600607208703
the golden panoramas. In Colorado, Ouray has its Fall Color Week    1.6065767145351917
Sept& 22-29, Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept& 24,    1.5636360329510388

_PLEASURE DOMES._ Two sharply contrasting places designed for    1.4513752902486308
public enjoyment are now on display.   The Corn Palace at Mitchell,    1.6065767145351917
S& Dak&, "the world's corniest building", has a carnival through    1.5636360329510388
Sept& 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt.    1.5636360329510388
Since 1892 ears of red, yellow, purple and white corn have annually    1.6432600607208703
been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create hugh "paintings". The    1.6432600607208703
1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial Centennial, with the pictures    1.5636360329510388
including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first river steamboat,    1.5636360329510388
the 1876 gold rush, a little red schoolhouse on the prairie, and    1.6432600607208703
today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs. The panels    1.5127085093302464
will stay up until they are replaced next summer.   Longwood    1.5636360329510388
Gardens, near Kennett Square, Pa& (about 12 miles from Wilmington,    1.5636360329510388
Del&), was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre S&    1.6065767145351917
du Pont. Every Wednesday night through Oct& 11 there will be    1.6065767145351917
an elaborate colored fountain display, with 229 nozzles throwing jets    1.5636360329510388
of water up to 130 feet. The "peacock tail" nozzle throws a giant    1.67495327387791
fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high. The gardens themselves    1.67495327387791
are open free of charge the year round, and the 192 permanent employes    1.67495327387791
make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out    1.7269387314284994
by any visitor. The greenhouses alone cover 3-1/2 acres.    1.5127085093302464
_CLOCK WITHOUT HANDS._ Carson McCullers, after a long, painful    1.5127085093302464
illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul, has come    1.5636360329510388
back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller    1.67495327387791
lists even before official publication. Though the subject- segregation    1.5127085093302464
in her native South- has been thoroughly worked, Miss McCullers    1.5636360329510388
uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm    1.5127085093302464
her place at the very top of modern American writing. @ _FRANNY    1.6065767145351917

the most eagerly awaited novel of the season (his first since <The    1.6432600607208703
Catcher in the Rye>), he tells of a college girl in flight from the    1.7026049541338664

statesman with two enviable possessions, a lovely young bride and a head    1.6432600607208703
containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove    1.5636360329510388
it for greater comfort. There is probably a moral in all this about    1.67495327387791

_PURPLE NOON:_ This French    1.0

Of the nation's eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number    1.5636360329510388
have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat-    1.7026049541338664
at least in that broad balmy region that lies below America's    1.6065767145351917
belt line. Waterways are busy right now from the Virginia capes    1.6065767145351917
to the Texas coast. There true yachtsmen often find November winds    1.6065767145351917
steadier, the waters cooler, the fish hungrier, and rivers more pleasant-    1.6065767145351917
less turbulence and mud, and fewer floating logs.   More and    1.5636360329510388
more boats move overland on wheels (1.8 million trailers are now in    1.6432600607208703
use) and Midwesterners taking long weekends can travel south with their    1.6065767145351917
craft. In the Southwest, the fall brings out flotillas of boatsmen    1.6065767145351917
who find the summer too hot for comfort. And on northern shores indomitable    1.67495327387791
sailors from Long Island to Lake Michigan will beat around    1.5636360329510388
the buoys in dozens of frostbite races. Some pleasant fall cruising    1.6065767145351917

_WEST COAST._ Pleasure    1.0
boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp    1.6432600607208703
breezes bring out craft of every size on every kind of water- ocean,    1.67495327387791
lake and reservoir. Shore facilities are enormous- Los Angeles    1.5127085093302464
harbors 5,000 boats, and Long Beach 3,000- but marinas are crowded    1.6065767145351917
everywhere. New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa del Rey,    1.6432600607208703
Ventura, Dana Point, Oceanside and Mission Bay.   Inland,    1.4513752902486308
outboard motorists welcome cooler weather and the chance to buzz over    1.6065767145351917
Colorado River sandbars and Lake Mead. Newest small-boat playground    1.5127085093302464
is the Salton Sea, a once-dry desert sinkhole which is now a    1.6432600607208703

fuel service is back to normal, and explorers can roam as far west as    1.7026049541338664
Port Isabel on the Mexican border. Sailing activity is slowed down    1.6065767145351917

San Jacinto, Trinity and Brazos rivers (fine tarpon fishing in    1.5636360329510388

At New Orleans, 25-mile-square Lake Pontchartrain has few squalls    1.5127085093302464

{A YEAR} ago it was bruited that the primary character    1.5636360329510388
in Erich    1.0
Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso    1.5636360329510388
de Portago, the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia    1.6432600607208703
automobile race of 1957. If this was in fact Mr& Remarque's    1.6065767145351917
intention he has achieved a notable failure. Clerfayt of "Heaven    1.5636360329510388
Has No Favorites" resembles Portago only in that he is male and    1.6432600607208703
a race-driver- quite a bad race-driver, whereas Portago was a good    1.6065767145351917
one. He is a dull, unformed, and aimless person; the twelfth Marquis    1.6432600607208703
de Portago was intelligent, purposeful, and passionate.   One    1.4513752902486308
looked forward to Mr& Remarque's ninth book if only because    1.5636360329510388
not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile    1.67495327387791
racing, as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised. Unhappily,    1.5636360329510388
"Heaven Has No Favorites" does not alter the record except to    1.6065767145351917
add one more bad book to the list.   Mr& Remarque's conception    1.6065767145351917
of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble. He proposed throwing    1.6432600607208703
together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced    1.67495327387791
on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery. His    1.5636360329510388
treatment of it is something else. His heroine chooses to die- the    1.6432600607208703
price of recovery, years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium, being    1.6432600607208703
higher than she wishes to pay. Her lover precedes her in death, at    1.67495327387791
the wheel, and presumably he too has chosen. Between the first meeting    1.6432600607208703
of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement, Mr& Remarque    1.5636360329510388
has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse, some demure    1.5636360329510388
and rather fetching love-making, pleasant talk about some of the    1.5636360329510388
countryside and restaurants of Europe, and a modicum of automobile racing.    1.6065767145351917
The ramblings on life, death, and the wonder of it all are distressing;    1.67495327387791
the love-making, perhaps because it is pale and low-key when    1.5636360329510388
one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness, is    1.6065767145351917
often charming; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality.   1.5636360329510388
This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and    1.5636360329510388
it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author    1.67495327387791
drawn Clerfayt as, say, a tournament golfer. Hazards to life and    1.6065767145351917
limb on the golf course, while existent, are actuarially insignificant.    1.5636360329510388
Race-drivers, on the other hand, are quite often killed on the circuit,    1.6432600607208703
and since it was obviously Mr& Remarque's intention to establish    1.5636360329510388
automobile racing as life in microcosm, one might reasonably have    1.5636360329510388
expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques    1.5636360329510388
but of mores and attitudes. He does not. The jacket biography describes    1.6432600607208703
him as a former racing driver, and he may indeed have been, although    1.67495327387791
I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records    1.6432600607208703
or the literature. Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal. The    1.6432600607208703
book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary    1.6432600607208703
for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities    1.67495327387791
of racing. The necessity is not clear to me, and, in any case,    1.67495327387791
to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car,    1.6432600607208703
which, or whom, he calls "Giuseppe", parked "on the Place Vendome    1.6065767145351917
sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around    1.5127085093302464
him" is not a liberty; it is an absurdity.   But it is in the    1.7026049541338664
matter of preoccupation with death, which is the primary concern of    1.6065767145351917
the book, that Remarque's failure is plainest. Clerfayt is neurotic,    1.5636360329510388
preoccupied, and passive. To be human, he believes, is to seek one's    1.6432600607208703
own destruction: the Freudian "death-wish" cliche inevitably    1.3761581156320553
cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers. In point of fact,    1.6065767145351917
the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent, healthy    1.5127085093302464
technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the    1.6432600607208703
passion they feel for the work by which they live. A Clerfayt may moon    1.7026049541338664
on about the face of Death in the cockpit; a Portago could say,    1.67495327387791
as he did say to me, "If I die tomorrow, still I have had twenty-eight    1.7269387314284994
wonderful years; but I shan't die tomorrow; I'll live    1.5127085093302464
to be 105".   Clerfayt, transported, may think of the engine    1.5636360329510388
driving his car as "a mystical beast under the hood". The Italian    1.6432600607208703
master Piero Taruffi, no less sensitive, knows twice the ecstasy    1.5636360329510388
though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles    1.7269387314284994
an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae. Clerfayt,    1.6065767145351917
driving,    1.0
sees himself "a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell";    1.5636360329510388
the Briton Stirling Moss, one of the greatest <virtuosi> of all    1.6065767145351917
time, believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related    1.6065767145351917
to ballet.   Errors in technical terminology suggest that    1.4513752902486308
the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything    1.6065767145351917
Mr& Remarque hoped to tell us.   However, my principal    1.5127085093302464
objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers,    1.67495327387791
pilots, submariners, atomic researchers, and all the machine-masters    1.4513752902486308
of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.   1.5127085093302464
{THE WEST} is leaderless, according to this book. In    1.5127085093302464
contrast,    1.0
the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev, Tito,    1.6432600607208703
and Mao. Against this invincible determination to communize the    1.5127085093302464
whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals    1.6432600607208703
and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common    1.6432600607208703
good of all.   It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that    1.5636360329510388
in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really    1.7026049541338664
care about democracy or Christianity; about 30 per cent call themselves    1.6065767145351917
Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered    1.5636360329510388
respectable, and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and    1.6432600607208703
believers in democracy.   But these Western countries do care    1.5127085093302464
about themselves. Each feels intensely national. If, say, the Russians    1.5636360329510388
intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub, then Tom Jones    1.6432600607208703
would fight the Commies. But he would fight for his own liberty rather    1.67495327387791
than for any abstract principle connected with it- such as "cause".    1.6065767145351917
For all practical purposes, the West stands disunited, undedicated,    1.5127085093302464
and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.   With    1.5127085093302464
this barrage, Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the    1.5636360329510388
blunderings of the West. Never given to mincing words, he places heavy    1.6432600607208703
blame upon the faulty, uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly    1.5636360329510388
America. At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed    1.5127085093302464
from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention    1.5127085093302464
to the creation of a welfare state. With Britain looking inward, overseas    1.6432600607208703
problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United    1.6432600607208703
States.   Montgomery believes that she started well. "America    1.4513752902486308
gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend    1.5636360329510388
and foe alike". She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into    1.5636360329510388
prosperity, but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace.    1.6432600607208703
America has divided more than she has united the West. The reasons    1.6432600607208703
are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with    1.6065767145351917
dollars, and that she compulsively strives to be liked. However, she    1.6065767145351917
really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by    1.7026049541338664
a quality of leadership that is basically needed.   But the greater    1.6065767145351917
reason for fumbling, stumbling American leadership is due to the    1.5636360329510388
shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor.    1.6065767145351917
"They are determined", Montgomery writes, "not to be surprised    1.5127085093302464
again, and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not    1.7026049541338664
only unnecessary, but also creates nervousness **h among other nations    1.5636360329510388
in the Western Alliance- not to mention such great suspicions among    1.6065767145351917
the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful    1.6065767145351917
coexistence or disarmament is not possible".   The net result    1.5127085093302464
is that under American leadership the general world situation has    1.5636360329510388
become bad. To "Monty", the American people, who in two previous    1.6065767145351917
world wars were very reluctant to join the fight, "now look like the    1.67495327387791
{AS}    1.0
faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States    1.5636360329510388
must be relied upon to lead. The path to leadership is made clear.    1.67495327387791
Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own    1.6432600607208703
house in order. Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and    1.7269387314284994
sensible advice to the whole group, a person in whom all the member nations    1.7026049541338664
will have absolute confidence. This leader must be a man who lives    1.6432600607208703
above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of    1.5636360329510388
the United States, namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany,    1.6432600607208703
that the East German government does not exist, that events in    1.6065767145351917
Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired, that the true government    1.5636360329510388
of China is in Formosa, that Mao was the evil influence behind    1.6432600607208703
Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960, and that    1.6432600607208703
either China or Russia wants or expects war.   Such a leader    1.6065767145351917
must strengthen ~NATO politically, and establish that true unity    1.5127085093302464
about which it has always talked. After drastically overhauling ~NATO,    1.5636360329510388
Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that    1.5127085093302464
tear apart the East and West. Major to this effort is to get all    1.7026049541338664
world powers to withdraw to their own territories, say by 1970. "The    1.6432600607208703
West should make the central proposal; but the East would have    1.6065767145351917
to show sincerity in carrying it out".   "But where is the    1.6065767145351917
leader who will handle all these things for us"? Montgomery knew    1.6065767145351917
all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy. The man whom he    1.7026049541338664
would select as our leader for this great task is de Gaulle. He alone    1.7026049541338664
has the wisdom, the conviction, the tenacity, and the courage to reach    1.6432600607208703
a decision. But de Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's    1.67495327387791
lost soul.   Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous    1.5636360329510388
path to leadership. The leader Montgomery envisages will need    1.5127085093302464
to discipline himself, lead a carefully regulated and orderly life,    1.5636360329510388
allow time for quiet thought and reflection, adapt decisions and plans    1.6065767145351917
to changing situations, be ruthless, particularly with inefficiency,    1.4513752902486308
and be honest and morally proper. All in all, Montgomery calls for a    1.67495327387791
leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him.    1.6065767145351917
{IN LOOKING} as far back as Moses, thence to Cromwell,    1.5636360329510388
Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, and Nehru, Montgomery attempts    1.3761581156320553
to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men. He believes that    1.6432600607208703
greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented    1.7026049541338664
by Churchill, who would very possibly have gone down in history    1.6065767145351917
as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war.   1.6432600607208703
However, Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory    1.4513752902486308
and practice. Most of what is said about his great men of history    1.67495327387791
has already been said, and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary    1.7026049541338664
scene. Like Eisenhower, he holds the militarist's suspicion    1.4513752902486308
of politicians. However, at the same time Montgomery selects as    1.5636360329510388
his hero de Gaulle, who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions.    1.6432600607208703
"Monty" shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement    1.5127085093302464
and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support.    1.5127085093302464
For the most part, his writing rambles and jogs, preventing easy access    1.6432600607208703
by the reader to his true thoughts.   Nevertheless, Montgomery    1.5127085093302464
has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world.    1.6065767145351917
It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership.    1.7026049541338664
And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form    1.67495327387791
can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the    1.5636360329510388
current shape of events.   1.0
{IT IS} no common thing for a listener (critical or otherwise)    1.6065767145351917
to hear a singer "live" for the first time only after he    1.6432600607208703
has died. But then, Mario Lanza was no common singer, and his whole    1.67495327387791
career, public and non-public, was studded with the kind of unconventional    1.6065767145351917
happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first "recital"    1.5636360329510388
only when he has ceased to be a living voice. It is a kind    1.7026049541338664
of justice, too, that it should originate in London's Royal Albert    1.6065767145351917
Hall, where, traditionally, the loudest, if not the greatest, performers    1.5636360329510388
have entertained the thousands it will accommodate (~RCA Victor    1.5127085093302464
~LM 2454, $4.98).   To be sure, Lanza made numerous concert    1.5636360329510388
tours, here and abroad, but these did not take him to New York    1.67495327387791
where the carping critic might lurk.   1.2818970554302986
The reading public, the theatergoing public, the skindiving    1.4513752902486308
public, the    1.0
horse-playing public- all these and others fill substantial roles    1.5127085093302464
in U&S& life, but none is so varied, vast and vigilant as the eating    1.7026049541338664
public. The Department of Agriculture averaged out U&S&    1.4513752902486308
food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs& per person, which, allowing    1.6065767145351917
for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry    1.67495327387791
every night, means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow    1.6432600607208703
down 8 lbs& or more a day. That mother hen of the weight-height    1.67495327387791
tables, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co&, clucks that 48 million    1.5636360329510388
Americans are overweight.   Through previous centuries, eating    1.3761581156320553
changed by nearly imperceptible degrees, and mostly toward just    1.5127085093302464
getting enough. Now big forces buffet food. For the first time in history,    1.67495327387791
the U&S& has produced a society in which less than one-tenth    1.6065767145351917
of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most    1.6432600607208703
embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million    1.5636360329510388
tons of surplus farm produce. In this same society, the plain citizen    1.6432600607208703
can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than    1.67495327387791
he can consume. Refrigeration, automated processing and packaging    1.4513752902486308
conspire to defy season and banish spoilage. And in the wake of the new    1.7026049541338664
affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American    1.6065767145351917
interest in how what people eat affects their health. To eat is human,    1.67495327387791
the nation is learning to think, to survive divine.    1.5127085093302464
Not all the concern for health is well directed. From the fusty    1.6432600607208703
panaceas of spinach, eggs and prunes, the U&S& has progressed    1.5636360329510388
to curds, concentrates and capsules. Each year, reports the American    1.5636360329510388
Medical Association, ten million Americans spend $900 million on    1.5127085093302464
vitamins, tonics and other food supplements. At juice bars in Los    1.6065767145351917
Angeles' 35 "health" stores, a new sensation is a pink, high-protein    1.6065767145351917
cocktail, concocted of dried eggs, powdered milk and cherry-flavored    1.5127085093302464
No-Cal, which sells for 59@ per 8-oz& glass. Grocery stores    1.5636360329510388
sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all.   1.7026049541338664
But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet    1.67495327387791
and health, and a big group of U&S& scientists wants to supply    1.6432600607208703
them. The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University    1.67495327387791
of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys, 57, inventor of the wartime    1.5636360329510388
~K (for Keys) ration and author of last year's bestselling    1.5636360329510388
<Eat Well and Stay Well>. From his birch-paneled office in the    1.6065767145351917
Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene, under the university's football    1.4513752902486308
stadium in Minneapolis ("We get a rumble on every touchdown"),    1.5636360329510388
blocky, grey-haired Dr& Keys directs an ambitious, $200,000-a-year    1.4513752902486308
experiment on diet, which spans three continents and seven nations    1.5636360329510388
and is still growing. Pursuing it, he has logged 500,000 miles, suffered    1.6432600607208703
indescribable digestive indignities, and meticulously collected    1.2818970554302986
physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals,    1.6065767145351917
from Bantu tribesmen to Italian <contadini>. He has measured    1.5127085093302464
the skinfolds (the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades) of Neapolitan    1.6065767145351917
firemen, studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters, analyzed    1.4513752902486308
the "mealie-meal" eaten by Capetown coloreds, and experimented    1.4513752902486308
Keys's findings,    1.0
though far from complete, are likely to smash many an eating cliche.    1.6432600607208703
Vitamins, eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on (though    1.7026049541338664
mothers' milk is still the ticket). Readings of the number of milligrams    1.6432600607208703
of cholesterol in the blood, which seem to have value in predicting    1.6432600607208703
heart attacks, are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram,    1.5127085093302464
which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack. Already    1.6432600607208703
many an American knows his count, and rejoices or worries depending    1.6065767145351917
on whether it is nearer 180 (safe) or 250 (dangerous).   Out    1.6065767145351917
of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far:   @ Americans    1.5127085093302464
eat too much. The typical U&S& daily menu, says Dr&    1.5636360329510388
Keys, contains 3,000 calories, should contain 2,300. And extra weight    1.5636360329510388
increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, artery disease and heart attack.   1.6065767145351917
@ Americans eat too much fat. With meat, milk, butter    1.5127085093302464
and ice cream, the calorie-heavy U&S& diet is 40% fat, and most    1.6432600607208703
of that is saturated fat- the insidious kind, says Dr& Keys,    1.6065767145351917
that increases blood cholesterol, damages arteries, and leads to coronary    1.5636360329510388
disease.    1.0
Throughout much of the    1.0
world, food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population    1.6432600607208703
has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.    1.6432600607208703
The deficiency diseases- scurvy, tropical sprue, pellagra- run    1.4513752902486308
rampant. In West Africa, for example, where meat is a luxury and babies    1.67495327387791
must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals,    1.67495327387791
a childhood menace is <kwashiorkor,> or "red Johnny", a growth-stunting    1.5636360329510388
protein deficiency (signs: reddish hair, bloated belly)    1.3761581156320553
that kills more than half its victims, leaves the rest prey for parasites    1.67495327387791
and lingering tropical disease.   In the well-fed U&S&,    1.4513752902486308
deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years. Today,    1.6065767145351917
as Harrison's <Principles of Internal Medicine,> a standard    1.4513752902486308
internist's text, puts it, "The most common form of malnutrition    1.5636360329510388
is caloric excess or obesity".   Puritan New England regarded    1.5127085093302464
obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance, and thus a sin. Says    1.6432600607208703
Keys: "Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral,    1.6432600607208703
the fat man would start to think". Morals aside, the fat man    1.6432600607208703
has plenty to worry about- over and above the fact that no one any    1.7026049541338664
longer loves him. The simple mechanical strain of overweight, says New    1.6065767145351917
York's Dr& Norman Jolliffe, can overburden and damage the    1.5127085093302464
heart "for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac    1.67495327387791
body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it    1.7269387314284994
was built". The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to    1.67495327387791
pay higher premiums. He has- for unclear reasons- a 25% higher    1.6065767145351917
death rate from cancer. He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes. He    1.6065767145351917
may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable, because excess    1.5127085093302464
body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement.   1.5636360329510388
Physiologically, people overeat because what Dr& Jolliffe    1.3761581156320553
calls the "appestat" is set too high. The appestat, which adjusts    1.6065767145351917
the appetite to keep weight constant, is located, says Jolliffe,    1.5636360329510388
in the hypothalamus- near the body's temperature, sleep and water-balance    1.5636360329510388
controls. Physical exercise raises the appestat. So does cold    1.5127085093302464
weather. In moderate doses, alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances    1.5636360329510388
appetite (the original reason for the cocktail); but because liquor    1.5636360329510388
has a high caloric value- 100 calories per oz&- the heavy    1.6065767145351917
drinker is seldom hungry. In rare cases, diseases such as encephalitis    1.6065767145351917
or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently, destroying    1.5636360329510388
nearly all sense of satiety.    1.1606783668269585
Far more frequently,    1.0
overeating    1.0
is the result of a psychological compulsion. It    1.4513752902486308
may be fostered by frustration, depression, insecurity- or, in children,    1.5636360329510388
simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging. Some    1.6065767145351917
families place undue emphasis on food: conversations center on it,    1.5636360329510388
and rich delicacies are offered as rewards, withheld as punishment. The    1.6065767145351917
result says Jolliffe: "The child gains the feeling that food    1.5636360329510388
is the purpose of life". Food may act as a sedative, giving temporary    1.67495327387791
emotional solace, just as, for some people, alcohol does. Reports    1.5636360329510388
Dr& Keys: "A fairly common experience for us is the wife who    1.6432600607208703
finds her husband staying out more and more. He may be interested in    1.67495327387791
another woman, or just like being with the boys. So she fishes around    1.67495327387791
in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake. It's a matter of    1.67495327387791
boredom, and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something,    1.6065767145351917
because she's being deprived of something else".   For the    1.5127085093302464
army of compulsive eaters- from the nibblers and the gobblers to    1.6065767145351917
the downright gluttons- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely    1.67495327387791
won. Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants    1.4513752902486308
as the amphetamines    1.0
(Benzedrine, Dexedrine) as dangerous "crutches    1.1606783668269585
for a weak will".   Keys has no such objections to Metrecal,    1.6065767145351917
Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are    1.5636360329510388
currently winning favor from dieters. "Metrecal is a pretty complete    1.5636360329510388
food", he says. "It contains large amounts of protein, vitamins    1.5636360329510388
and minerals. In the quantity of 900 calories a day, anyone will lose    1.67495327387791
weight on it- 20, 30 or 40 lbs&". But Keys worries that the    1.67495327387791
Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological    1.5636360329510388
adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food.    1.5636360329510388
Despite his personal distaste for obesity    1.2818970554302986
("disgusting"), Dr& Keys has only an incidental interest    1.4513752902486308
in how much Americans eat. What concerns him much more is the relationship    1.67495327387791
of diet to the nation's No& 1 killer: coronary artery disease,    1.6065767145351917
which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills    1.6432600607208703
500,000 Americans a year- twice the toll from all varieties of    1.6065767145351917
cancer, five times the deaths from automobile accidents.   Cholesterol,    1.5127085093302464
the cornerstone of Dr& Keys's theory, is a mysterious    1.5127085093302464
yellowish,    1.0
waxy substance, chemically a crystalline alcohol. Scientists    1.3761581156320553
assume that cholesterol (from the Greek <chole,> meaning bile, and    1.5636360329510388
<sterios,> meaning solid) is somehow necessary for the formation of    1.5636360329510388
brain cells, since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total    1.6432600607208703
solid weight. They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones. They    1.6432600607208703
suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones, and    1.6432600607208703
they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the    1.6432600607208703
circulatory system. But they cannot fully explain the process of its    1.6065767145351917
manufacture by the human liver. Although the fatty protein molecules,    1.5636360329510388
carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol, are water soluble,    1.6432600607208703
cholesterol itself is insoluble, and cannot be destroyed by the    1.5636360329510388
body. "A remarkable substance", says Dr& Keys, "quite apart    1.5127085093302464
from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries".   1.6065767145351917
When thus deposited, Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible    1.5636360329510388
for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks. Explains    1.5636360329510388
Keys: As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream,    1.5636360329510388
they are deposited in the intima, or inner wall of a coronary artery.    1.67495327387791
The proteins and fats are burned off, and the cholesterol is left    1.6432600607208703
behind. As cholesterol piles up, it narrows, irritates and damages the    1.6065767145351917
artery, encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation.    1.5127085093302464
Eventually, says Keys, one of two things happens. A clot forms    1.6065767145351917
at the site, seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes    1.7026049541338664
a heart attack. Or (more commonly, thinks Keys) the deposits themselves    1.6065767145351917
get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that    1.7026049541338664
an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated, cells supplied    1.5636360329510388
by the artery die, and the heart is permanently, perhaps fatally injured.    1.6432600607208703
Ordinarily, the human liver synthesizes    1.1606783668269585
only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs- for transportation    1.5636360329510388
of fats and for production of bile. Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich    1.6432600607208703
foods, eaten in normal amounts, says Dr& Keys, do not materially    1.6065767145351917
affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood. But fatty foods    1.6065767145351917
do.   During World War /2,, doctors in The Netherlands    1.5127085093302464
and Scandinavia noted a curious fact: despite the stresses of Nazi    1.6065767145351917
occupation, the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping.    1.6065767145351917
Not until long after the war- 1950, in fact- did they get    1.6432600607208703
a hint of the reason. That year, Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed    1.6065767145351917
that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe    1.5636360329510388
restrictions on fatty foods. That same year the University of California's    1.6065767145351917
Dr& Laurance Kinsell, timing oxidation rates of blood    1.4513752902486308
fats, stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood    1.6065767145351917
cholesterol levels to drop radically, while animal fats cause them to    1.6065767145351917
rise. Here Keys and others, such as Dr& A& E& Ahrens of    1.6432600607208703
the Rockefeller Institute, took over to demonstrate the chemical difference    1.5636360329510388
between vegetable and animal fats- and even between different    1.5127085093302464
varieties of each.   All natural food fats fall into one of three    1.6432600607208703
categories- saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated.    1.1606783668269585
The    1.0
degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the    1.6432600607208703
fat molecule. Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens. Mono-unsaturated    1.5636360329510388
fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule,    1.5636360329510388
and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens.   1.6432600607208703
The three fats have similar caloric values (about 265 calories    1.5636360329510388
per oz&), but each exerts a radically different influence on    1.5636360329510388
blood cholesterol.    1.0
As a result, although we still make use of this distinction, there is    1.67495327387791
much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed. Just what    1.67495327387791
is meant by "spirit" and by "matter"? The terms are generally    1.6065767145351917
taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic    1.6065767145351917
elements in the common experience of all. Yet in the contemporary    1.6065767145351917
context this is precisely what one must not do. For in the modern world    1.7026049541338664
neither "spirit" nor "matter" refer to any generally agreed-upon    1.5127085093302464
elements of experience. We are in a transitional stage in which    1.6065767145351917
many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected.    1.7026049541338664
When the words are used, we are never sure which of the traditional    1.67495327387791
meanings the user may have in mind, or to what extent his revisions    1.67495327387791
and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours.   1.4513752902486308
One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the    1.6065767145351917
almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit. Just a few centuries    1.6432600607208703
ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of    1.7026049541338664
material entities. Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly    1.67495327387791
educated as well was this true. Demons, fairies, angels, and a host    1.6432600607208703
of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential    1.6432600607208703
world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars. In such a world    1.7269387314284994
the words "matter" and "spirit" both referred to directly    1.5127085093302464
known realities in the common experience of all. In it important elements    1.6432600607208703
of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general,    1.6065767145351917
which now cause us much difficulty, could be responded to quite naturally    1.6432600607208703
and spontaneously.   The progress of science over these last    1.5127085093302464
few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific    1.5636360329510388
categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world    1.6432600607208703
of the entities which previously populated it. In carrying out this    1.6065767145351917
program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service    1.5127085093302464
for which it can claim due credit. The objectification of the world    1.6432600607208703
of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the    1.6432600607208703
experience of spirit could justify or support. Science is fully competent    1.6065767145351917
to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object    1.6432600607208703
in space and time. When, therefore, it turned its attention to the    1.6432600607208703
concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world    1.5636360329510388
of spirit, these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed    1.6065767145351917
as actual elements of external reality. In doing so science has unquestionably    1.6432600607208703
cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous    1.2818970554302986
and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable popular    1.5636360329510388
superstitions. There have been, indeed, many important and valuable gains    1.5636360329510388
from the development of our present scientific view of the world    1.6065767145351917
for which we may be rightly grateful.   All this has not, however,    1.6432600607208703
been an unmixed blessing. The scientific debunking of the spirit world    1.6065767145351917
has been in a way too successful and too thorough. The house has    1.67495327387791
been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means,    1.67495327387791
or at best with wholly inadequate means, for dealing with his experience    1.6432600607208703
of spirit. Although the particular form of conceptualization which    1.5127085093302464
popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit    1.6065767145351917
was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience itself which led to such    1.6065767145351917
excesses remains with us as vividly as ever. We simply find ourselves    1.6432600607208703
in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure    1.6432600607208703
and meaning of this range of our experience. There is no framework    1.6432600607208703
or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and    1.67495327387791
no part    1.0
of reality, as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which we    1.67495327387791
can refer this experience. Science has simply left us helpless and powerless    1.6432600607208703
in this important sector of our lives.   The situation in    1.5636360329510388
which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur    1.6432600607208703
Miller's play <The Crucible,> which deals with the Salem witch    1.5636360329510388
trials. As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community    1.6432600607208703
of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century.    1.6432600607208703
Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides    1.6065767145351917
the immediate problem in the opening scene, it is a quite normal community.    1.67495327387791
The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting    1.5127085093302464
the usual mixture of pleasures, foibles, irritations, and concerns    1.5127085093302464
which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any    1.6432600607208703
age. There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people.    1.67495327387791
Instead, the audience can sit back at ease and, from the perspective    1.6432600607208703
of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things,    1.6065767145351917
enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take    1.6432600607208703
the witches and devils which are under discussion. A teenage girl, Abigail    1.6432600607208703
Williams, is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle,    1.5127085093302464
the Reverend Samuel Parris, about a wild night affair in the woods    1.6432600607208703
in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with    1.7026049541338664
these evil beings. For all involved in this discussion the devil is    1.6432600607208703
a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night,    1.7269387314284994
the demon world is populated with real creatures, and witches actually    1.6065767145351917
can be seen flying through the air.   As the play unfolds, however,    1.6432600607208703
the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil    1.6432600607208703
which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community.    1.6065767145351917
Everyone in Salem, saint and sinner alike, is swept up by it.    1.6432600607208703
It is like a mysterious epidemic which, starting first with Abigail    1.6065767145351917
and Parris, spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through    1.5636360329510388
the whole town until all have been infected by it. It grows terribly    1.67495327387791
and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery,    1.67495327387791
moral disintegration, and destruction. The audience leaves the play    1.5127085093302464
under a spell, It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit    1.7026049541338664
in its living active manifestation always evokes.   If one asks    1.5636360329510388
about this play, what it is that comes upon this community and works    1.67495327387791
within it with such terrible power, there is no better answer to give    1.67495327387791
than "spirit". This is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but    1.67495327387791
only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a    1.67495327387791
common experience. In the end the good man, John Proctor, expresses    1.6065767145351917
what the audience has already come to feel when he says, "A fire,    1.67495327387791
a fire is burning! I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy    1.7026049541338664
face"! The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and    1.7026049541338664
concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with    1.7026049541338664
formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from    1.67495327387791
detecting the real devil when he came among them. We marvel at their    1.67495327387791
blindness for not seeing this. Yet are not we of the mid-twentieth    1.6432600607208703
century, who rightly do not believe there is any such "thing" as the    1.67495327387791
devil, just as bad off as they- only in a different way? In our    1.7026049541338664
disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are    1.7269387314284994
unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in    1.67495327387791
this play. We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare    1.7269387314284994
speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment    1.748515906000203
to that which has already been discredited and proved false.   1.5636360329510388
Even Mr& Miller himself seems uncertain on this score. In    1.5636360329510388
a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the    1.67495327387791
first act of the play, he says at one point: "However, that experience    1.67495327387791
never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld    1.7026049541338664
or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced lieutenants. And his    1.5127085093302464
belief is not to his discredit. Better minds than Hale's were-    1.6065767145351917
and still are- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond    1.6432600607208703
our ken". (page 33) On the other hand, a little later on he says:    1.7026049541338664
"Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out God's    1.6065767145351917
beard and the Devil's horns, but the world is still gripped between    1.6432600607208703
two diametrically opposed absolutes. The concept of unity, in which    1.5636360329510388
positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good    1.6432600607208703
and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always joined to the same phenomenon-    1.6432600607208703
such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences    1.5636360329510388
and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas **h. When we see    1.7269387314284994
the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's    1.6432600607208703
worthlessness- until redeemed- the necessity of the Devil may    1.5127085093302464
become evident as a weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time    1.67495327387791
again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church    1.7026049541338664
or church-state". (page 34)   Apparently he does not intend    1.5127085093302464
that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being    1.7269387314284994
actually real. Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that    1.6432600607208703
the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and    1.67495327387791
potency of that which came over Salem. It casts a spell upon them    1.67495327387791
so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence    1.7026049541338664
of an evil power. It is not enough in accounting for this feeling    1.67495327387791
to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together    1.6065767145351917
to produce a cumulative effect. For this does not account for the    1.6432600607208703
integral, elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as    1.6065767145351917
the play unfolds, nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness    1.67495327387791
which comes over those who watch the play like a spell. The    1.6432600607208703
reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions    1.67495327387791
to the contrary.    1.0
 There is    1.0
nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and    1.6432600607208703
universally felt than spirit. Apart from spirit there could be no community,    1.6432600607208703
for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any    1.67495327387791
community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence. Think, for example,    1.5127085093302464
of the spirit of the Marine Corps. Surely this is a reality we    1.67495327387791
all acknowledge. We cannot, of course, assign it any substance. It    1.6065767145351917
is not material and is not a "thing" occupying space and time. Yet    1.67495327387791
it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and    1.6432600607208703
known. So it is too with many other spirits which we all know: the    1.7026049541338664
spirit of Nazism or Communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street    1.6432600607208703
corner gang or a football team, the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux    1.7026049541338664
Klan. Every community, if it is alive has a spirit, and that spirit    1.67495327387791
is the center of its unity and identity.   In searching for clues    1.6432600607208703
which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit,    1.67495327387791
the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove    1.6065767145351917
the most fruitful. For it is primarily in community that we know and    1.67495327387791
experience spirit. It is spirit which gives life to a community and    1.6432600607208703
causes it to cohere. It is the spirit which is the source of a community's    1.7269387314284994
drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from    1.6432600607208703
the world outside so that the community grows and prospers. Yet the    1.6432600607208703
spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community.    1.6065767145351917
The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable    1.7026049541338664
ideas.   One characteristic of the spirit in community is    1.5127085093302464
its givenness. The members of the community do not create the spirit    1.6432600607208703
but rather find it present and waiting for them. It is for them a given    1.7269387314284994
which they and they alone possess. The spirit of the Marine Corps    1.6432600607208703
was present and operative before any of the present members of it came    1.67495327387791
into it. It is they, of course, who keep it alive and preserve it    1.7026049541338664
so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future    1.7026049541338664
recruits to find as they come into it.    1.4513752902486308
If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be    1.748515906000203
"understanded of the people"- and this, it must not be forgotten,    1.6065767145351917
is one of the goals of the perennial theological task- there is    1.6432600607208703
no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of    1.6065767145351917
representation.   1.0
This does not mean that mythological language as    1.4513752902486308
such can no longer be used in theology and preaching. The absurd notion    1.67495327387791
that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological    1.4513752902486308
concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention. His point    1.3761581156320553
is not that mythology may not be used, but that it may no longer be regarded    1.748515906000203
as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing    1.6065767145351917
the Christian kerygma. When we say that a mythological mode    1.5636360329510388
of thought must be completely abandoned, we mean it must be abandoned    1.6432600607208703
as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding    1.6065767145351917
of existence. Mythological concepts may by all means still be used,    1.6065767145351917
but they can be used responsibly only as "symbols" or "ciphers",    1.6065767145351917
that is, only if they are also constantly <interpreted> in nonmythological    1.6065767145351917
(or existential) terms.   The statement is often made    1.4513752902486308
that when Bultmann argues in this way, he "overestimates the intellectual    1.6065767145351917
stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting    1.6432600607208703
the Christian faith". But this statement is completely unconvincing.    1.5127085093302464
If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered    1.5127085093302464
to (and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who    1.7026049541338664
make such pronouncements), the evidence is overwhelming that he does    1.5636360329510388
not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of    1.6432600607208703
traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant. Nor is    1.5127085093302464
it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our    1.7026049541338664
culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly    1.5636360329510388
estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been    1.6065767145351917
communicated. On the contrary, even in the heart of "the Bible    1.6065767145351917
belt" itself, as can be attested by any one who is called to work there,    1.7269387314284994
the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under    1.5127085093302464
way, together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself    1.6065767145351917
and his world.   In fact, it is in just such a situation    1.6432600607208703
that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed. Although    1.5127085093302464
the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do    1.7026049541338664
not in a more secularized situation, the striking thing is the rapidity    1.6432600607208703
with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence. This is    1.6432600607208703
especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle    1.6065767145351917
class. Time and again in counseling and teaching, one encounters    1.5636360329510388
members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity    1.67495327387791
the insubstantial mythologies of their "fundamentalist" heritage    1.3761581156320553
and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious.   1.67495327387791
The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme "culture-Protestantism"    1.5636360329510388
so often observed to characterize the preaching    1.3761581156320553
and teaching of the American churches. In the absence of a truly adequate    1.67495327387791
conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed, the unavoidable    1.5636360329510388
need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at    1.6065767145351917
hand- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of    1.67495327387791
"folk religion" current in the situation. This is not to say that    1.6432600607208703
the <only> explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent    1.5636360329510388
Peale's "cult of reassurance" or the other types of a purely    1.6065767145351917
cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized    1.5127085093302464
gospel. But it is to say that this need is far more important for such    1.7269387314284994
infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected.   1.5636360329510388
However, even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly    1.6065767145351917
as widespread as we are claiming, at least among the cultured elements    1.6432600607208703
of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference    1.6065767145351917
to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace. To be    1.67495327387791
sure, when this is pointed out, a common response among certain churchmen    1.6432600607208703
is to fulminate about "the little flock" and "the great crowd"    1.6065767145351917
and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the "wisdom of    1.6065767145351917
the wise" in the opening chapter of First Corinthians. But can    1.6065767145351917
we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation? Can the church    1.67495327387791
risk assuming that the "folly" of men is as dear to God as their    1.7026049541338664
"wisdom", or, as is also commonly implied, that "the foolishness    1.5636360329510388
of God" and "the foolishness of men" are simply two ways    1.6065767145351917
of talking about the same thing? Can we continue to alienate precisely    1.6432600607208703
those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation    1.6432600607208703
our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious?   1.5127085093302464
There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church (which    1.6065767145351917
derives, however, from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from    1.6065767145351917
the Bible) that God is completely independent of his creation and    1.6065767145351917
so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world. by analogy,    1.7269387314284994
the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the    1.6065767145351917
"world" in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be    1.67495327387791
the church. But, as Scripture everywhere reminds us, God <does>    1.5636360329510388
have need of his creatures, and the church, <a fortiori>, can ill afford    1.67495327387791
to do without the talents with which the world, by God's providence,    1.6432600607208703
presents it.   And yet this is exactly the risk we run when    1.6432600607208703
we assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to preach the gospel    1.7269387314284994
in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured    1.6432600607208703
men. Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened    1.6065767145351917
men today can understand, we are depriving ourselves of the very resources    1.6432600607208703
on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends.   1.6065767145351917
In arguing in this way, we are obviously taking for granted    1.6065767145351917
that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved;    1.5636360329510388
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when    1.6065767145351917
we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction. But the main point    1.67495327387791
here is that even if such a restatement were <not> possible, the    1.6432600607208703
demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable.    1.5127085093302464
This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without    1.7026049541338664
condition. If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise    1.67495327387791
say no, or where I do not have the right to say anything at all, then    1.748515906000203
my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian. Expressed differently:    1.6432600607208703
if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ    1.6065767145351917
is some form of self-destruction, whether of the body or of the mind-    1.67495327387791
<sacrificium corporis, sacrificium intellectus>- then there is    1.3761581156320553
no alternative but that the price remain unpaid.   This must be    1.6065767145351917
stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding    1.6432600607208703
chapter. Modern man, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us, has    1.5636360329510388
"come of age"; and though this process by no means represents    1.6065767145351917
an unambiguous gain and is, in fact, marked by the estrangement from    1.6432600607208703
the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation, it is still    1.7026049541338664
a positive step forward; and those of us who so richly benefit from    1.67495327387791
it should be the last to despise it. In any event, it is an irreversible    1.7269387314284994
step, and if we are at all honest with ourselves, we will know we    1.7026049541338664
have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has    1.7026049541338664
seen fit to place us.   To say this, of course, is to take up a    1.7269387314284994
position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred    1.7026049541338664
years, or, at any rate, since the beginning of the distinctively modern    1.6432600607208703
period in theological thought. We have aligned ourselves with that    1.5636360329510388
"liberal" tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among    1.4513752902486308
the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl,    1.5636360329510388
Herrmann, Harnack, and Troeltsch, and more recently, Schweitzer and    1.5127085093302464
the early Barth and, in part at least, Bultmann. It is to this same    1.7026049541338664
tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and    1.6432600607208703
a half of American theology also belong. For we must number here not    1.67495327387791
only the names of Bushnell, Clarke, and Rauschenbusch, not to mention    1.6065767145351917
those of "the Chicago School" and Macintosh, but those of    1.5636360329510388
the brothers Niebuhr and (if America may claim him!) Tillich as    1.6065767145351917
well. Finally, we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously    1.6432600607208703
"neoliberal" movement that developed at the University    1.3761581156320553
of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work    1.6065767145351917
of Alfred North Whitehead.   What makes this long and diverse    1.5636360329510388
tradition essentially <one> is that those who have belonged to it    1.6065767145351917
have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively    1.6432600607208703
modern world. Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely    1.6065767145351917
within the tradition of the apostolic church, they have exhibited    1.5636360329510388
no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity.    1.5636360329510388
They have insisted, rather, on living fully and completely    1.5127085093302464
within modern culture and, so far from considering this treason to God,    1.6432600607208703
have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him.   1.7026049541338664
When we say, then, that today, in our situation, the demand for    1.6432600607208703
demythologization must be accepted without condition, we are simply    1.5127085093302464
saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring    1.67495327387791
achievement. However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's    1.5636360329510388
constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves must strive    1.4513752902486308
to formulate can only go <beyond> liberalism, not <behind> it.   1.5636360329510388
In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking    1.6432600607208703
the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a    1.5636360329510388
theology has led. For we have said, in effect, that of the two alternatives    1.7026049541338664
to his position variously represented by the other participants    1.5127085093302464
in the demythologizing discussion, only one is really an alternative.    1.5636360329510388
If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be    1.6065767145351917
accepted    1.0
by theology unconditionally, the position of the "right" is    1.5127085093302464
clearly untenable. Whereas Bultmann's "center" position is structurally    1.4513752902486308
inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds    1.4513752902486308
alone, the general position of the "right", as represented, say,    1.5636360329510388
by Karl Barth, involves the rejection or at least qualification of    1.6065767145351917
the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material    1.6065767145351917
grounds we have just considered.   It follows, then, provided    1.5127085093302464
the possibilities have been exhausted, that the only <real> alternative    1.5636360329510388
is the general viewpoint of the "left", which has been represented    1.6065767145351917
on the Continent by Fritz Buri and, to some extent at least,    1.6432600607208703
is found in much that is significant in American and English theology.   1.6432600607208703
In order to make the implications of our position as clear    1.6065767145351917
as possible, we may develop this argument at greater length.   We    1.6065767145351917
may show, first, that there cannot possibly be an alternative other    1.6065767145351917
than the three typically represented by Bultmann, Barth, and Buri.    1.5636360329510388
To do this, it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms    1.7269387314284994
of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more    1.67495327387791
than two, then the question of a "third" possibility is a meaningless    1.6432600607208703
question. Thus, if what is at issue is whether "All ~S    1.6065767145351917
is ~P", it is indifferent whether "Some ~S is not ~P"    1.6065767145351917
or "No ~S is ~P", since in either case the judgment in question    1.67495327387791
is false. Hence, if what is in question is whether in a given theology    1.7026049541338664
myth is or is not completely rejected, it is unimportant whether    1.6065767145351917
only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted;    1.6432600607208703
for, in either event, the first possibility is excluded. Therefore,    1.5636360329510388
the only conceivable alternatives are those represented, on the one hand,    1.6065767145351917
by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive    1.5636360329510388
positions of Buri and Barth and, on the other hand, by the third    1.67495327387791
but really pseudo position (analogous to a round square) of Bultmann.   1.6065767145351917
A second point requires more extended comment. It will be recalled    1.6065767145351917
from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the "right",    1.6432600607208703
as represented by Barth, rests on the following thesis: The    1.5636360329510388
only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that    1.5636360329510388
(1) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization    1.6065767145351917
and existential interpretation; (2) accepts instead a    1.3761581156320553
special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation; and (3)    1.5127085093302464
in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus    1.67495327387791
Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's point of    1.5636360329510388
view, are mythological.   1.0
ONE HUNDRED years ago there existed in England the Association    1.5636360329510388
for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom. Representing    1.5127085093302464
as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman    1.6432600607208703
and Anglican Churches, and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable    1.5636360329510388
to Rome, this association produced little fruit, and, in fact, was    1.6065767145351917
condemned by the Holy Office in 1864.   Now again in 1961, in    1.6432600607208703
England, there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly    1.6065767145351917
discussed as Christian unity. The Church Unity Octave, January    1.5127085093302464
18-25, was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various    1.6065767145351917
churches. Many people seem hopeful, yet it is difficult to predict    1.6065767145351917
whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian    1.6432600607208703
unity in 1961 than there was in 1861. But it must be readily seen    1.7026049541338664
that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these    1.6432600607208703
hundred years as to engender hope, at least on the Catholic side.    1.6432600607208703
For the "tide is well on the turn", as the London Catholic weekly    1.67495327387791
<Universe> has written.   I came to England last summer to    1.5636360329510388
do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman. As an    1.6065767145351917
American Catholic of Irish ancestry, I came with certain preconceptions    1.5636360329510388
and expectations; being intellectually influenced by Newman    1.3761581156320553
and the general 19th-century literature of England, I knew only a    1.6065767145351917
Protestant-dominated    1.0
country. Since arriving here, however, I have formed    1.4513752902486308
a far different religious picture of present-day England. In representing    1.5636360329510388
part of this new picture, I will be recounting some of my    1.6432600607208703
own personal experiences, reactions and judgments; but my primary aim    1.5636360329510388
is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing    1.5636360329510388
and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the    1.6065767145351917
present religious    1.0
state of England.   Since the Protestant clergy for the    1.5127085093302464
most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit, my Roman    1.7026049541338664
collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman    1.6432600607208703
Catholic cleric. In any case, I have always been treated with the    1.6432600607208703
utmost courtesy by Englishmen, even in Devonshire and Cornwall, where    1.5636360329510388
anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest.   1.5127085093302464
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism.    1.4513752902486308
On my first Guy Fawkes Day here, I found Catholics as well    1.6432600607208703
as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires,    1.5127085093302464
and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not    1.67495327387791
concerned with the historical significance of the day. A Birmingham    1.5636360329510388
newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled "The    1.6065767145351917
True Story of Guy Fawkes", which began:   "When you    1.5127085093302464
pile your    1.0
"guy" on the bonfire tomorrow night, I wonder how much of the    1.6432600607208703
true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember? In the 355 years since    1.67495327387791
the first Guy Fawkes Night, much of the story has been forgotten,    1.6432600607208703
so here is a reminder". The article proceeded to give an inaccurate    1.6432600607208703
IN    1.0
SPITE OF the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the    1.6432600607208703
conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's,    1.6065767145351917
the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very    1.6432600607208703
small one (four per cent, or 800,000) which did not enjoy a gracious    1.67495327387791
hearing from the general public. The return of the Catholic hierarchy    1.6065767145351917
in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and, in fact,    1.6065767145351917
was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty. In 1864 Newman professedly    1.6432600607208703
had to write his <Apologia> with his keenest feelings in    1.5636360329510388
order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers.   1.67495327387791
Now, in 1961, the Catholic population of England is still    1.5636360329510388
quite small (ten per cent, or 5 million); yet it represents a very    1.67495327387791
considerable percentage of the churchgoing population. A Protestant    1.4513752902486308
woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham    1.7269387314284994
Oratory (Catholic) Church on Sunday mornings. She found    1.4513752902486308
this a marvel because, as she said, only six per cent of English people    1.7026049541338664
are churchgoers. She may not have been exact on this number, but    1.6432600607208703
others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than    1.6432600607208703
ten. From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly    1.6065767145351917
attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during    1.6065767145351917
services. A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of    1.6065767145351917
a large city university, following Anglican evensong, at which there    1.5636360329510388
was a congregation of twelve, he celebrated Mass before more than a    1.6432600607208703
hundred.   The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the    1.5636360329510388
great falling off in effective membership in their churches. According    1.5636360329510388
to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England,    1.67495327387791
the "total of confirmed members is 9,748,000, but only 2,887,671    1.5636360329510388
are registered on the parochial church rolls", and "over 27 million    1.6065767145351917
people in England are baptized into the Church of England, but    1.6065767145351917
roughly only a tenth of them continue". An amazing article in the    1.6432600607208703
<Manchester Guardian> of last November, entitled "Fate of Redundant    1.5127085093302464
Churches", states than an Archbishops' Commission "reported    1.3761581156320553
last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790    1.6432600607208703
churches which are redundant now, or will be in 20 years' time. A further    1.7026049541338664
260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948". And    1.5127085093302464
in the last five years, the "Methodist chapel committee has    1.5636360329510388
authorized    1.0
the demolition or, more often, the sale of 764 chapels". Most of    1.6432600607208703
these former churches are now used as warehouses, but "neither Anglicans    1.6065767145351917
nor    1.0
Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics",    1.4513752902486308
and have done so.   While it must be said that these same    1.6432600607208703
Protestants have built some new churches during this period, and that    1.6065767145351917
religious population shifts have emptied churches, a principal reason    1.5127085093302464
for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are    1.5636360329510388
going to church. It should be admitted, too, that there is a good    1.67495327387791
percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics (one paper writes 50    1.5636360329510388
per cent). Still, it is clear from such reports, and apparently clear    1.6432600607208703
from the remarks of many people, that Protestants are decreasing and    1.6065767145351917
Catholics increasing.   An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly    1.4513752902486308
but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true. A century ago,    1.6432600607208703
Newman saw that liberalism (what we now might call secularism) would    1.6065767145351917
gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism, and    1.5636360329510388
that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a "serviceable    1.6065767145351917
breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own".    1.5127085093302464
That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems no longer very meaningful    1.67495327387791
to call England a "Protestant country". One of the ironies    1.5636360329510388
of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively    1.67495327387791
speaking, many real Christians to unite.   Many English    1.4513752902486308
Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are    1.6065767145351917
in a new ascendancy. The London <Universe> devoted its centenary    1.5636360329510388
issue    1.0
last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress    1.6065767145351917
during the last one hundred years. With traditional nationalistic spirit,    1.5636360329510388
some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism    1.4513752902486308
at its best. I have found myself saying with other foreigners here    1.6432600607208703
that English Catholics <are> good Catholics. It has been my experience    1.6065767145351917
to find as many men as women in church, and to hear almost everyone    1.7026049541338664
in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses    1.5127085093302464
at Mass.   They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-Catholic    1.5636360329510388
population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday Benediction    1.5636360329510388
they recite by heart the "Prayer for England":   "O Blessed    1.5636360329510388
Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother,    1.6432600607208703
look down in mercy upon England, thy "dowry", and upon us    1.6065767145351917
all who greatly hope and trust in thee **h. Intercede for our separated    1.67495327387791
brethren, that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the    1.7269387314284994
chief Shepherd, the vicar of thy Son **h". A hymn often to be    1.67495327387791
heard in Catholic churches is "Faith of our Fathers", which glories    1.6065767145351917
in England's ancient faith that endured persecution, and which    1.5127085093302464
proclaims: "Faith of our Fathers: Mary's prayers/Shall win    1.4513752902486308
our country back to thee". The English saints are widely venerated,    1.6065767145351917
quite naturally, and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs    1.6432600607208703
and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized.   Because they    1.5127085093302464
have kept the faith of their medieval fathers, English Catholics have    1.6065767145351917
always strongly resented the charge of being "un-English". I    1.5127085093302464
have not seen this charge made during my stay here, but apparently it    1.67495327387791
is still in the air. For example, a writer in a recent number of <The    1.7269387314284994
Queen> hyperbolically states that "of the myriad imprecations the    1.5127085093302464
only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion    1.6065767145351917
that they are 'un-English'". In this connection, it has been    1.5636360329510388
observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics, priests and    1.5636360329510388
laity, in England, while certainly seen as good for Catholicism,    1.5636360329510388
is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic    1.6432600607208703
English Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to remind    1.5127085093302464
ONE OF THE    1.0
more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century    1.6065767145351917
is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities.    1.5636360329510388
At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics,    1.6065767145351917
partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854. Moreover,    1.5636360329510388
for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the    1.6065767145351917
city to care for their religious needs. Now, not only are there considerably    1.67495327387791
more laity as students and professors at Oxford, but there    1.5636360329510388
are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable    1.5636360329510388
and friendly relations with the non-Catholic members of the University.    1.5636360329510388
Some Catholic priests lecture there; Catholic seminarians attend    1.4513752902486308
tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students.   1.5127085093302464
Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable    1.5127085093302464
position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it    1.6432600607208703
in the mass media of England. The general tone of articles appearing    1.6432600607208703
in such important newspapers as the Manchester <Guardian> and the    1.5636360329510388
Sunday <Observer> implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic    1.5127085093302464
Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant    1.67495327387791
churches. On successive Sundays during October, 1960, Paul Ferris    1.5127085093302464
(a non-Catholic) wrote articles in the <Observer> depicting    1.4513752902486308
clergymen of the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist    1.67495327387791
Church. The Catholic priest, though somewhat superficially    1.3761581156320553
drawn, easily came out the best. There were many letters of strong    1.6432600607208703
protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman, who was indeed    1.6065767145351917
portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters    1.5636360329510388
and without really very much to do as clergyman. Such a series of    1.67495327387791
articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-Victorian    1.6065767145351917
England. There was so much interest shown in this present-day    1.5636360329510388
venture that it was continued on B&B&C&, where comments were    1.5636360329510388
equally made by an Anglican parson, a Free Church minister and a Catholic    1.67495327387791
priest.   Catholic priests have frequently appeared on    1.3761581156320553
television programs, sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal    1.5636360329510388
footing with Protestant clergymen. A notable example of this was    1.5636360329510388
the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool,    1.6065767145351917
Dr& Heenan, and the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr&    1.5127085093302464
Ramsey, recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. The good    1.4513752902486308
feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now    1.6065767145351917
well known in England. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary    1.6432600607208703
has been televised several times in recent months. And it was    1.6065767145351917
interesting to observe that B&B&C&'s television film on Christmas    1.5127085093302464
Eve was <The Bells of St& Mary's>.   Of course,    1.5127085093302464
the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern    1.5636360329510388
of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr&    1.6065767145351917
Fisher, then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Vatican    1.5127085093302464
last December. It was the first time an English Primate has done    1.6432600607208703
this since the 14th century. English Catholics reacted to this event    1.6065767145351917
with moderate but real hope.   Almost daily something is reported    1.5636360329510388
which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing    1.6065767145351917
numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of    1.5127085093302464
a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic    1.6432600607208703
priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun    1.6432600607208703
had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during    1.6065767145351917
the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a    1.6432600607208703
respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still    1.5636360329510388
in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords    1.6065767145351917
in the next generation"; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen    1.5636360329510388
and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at    1.6065767145351917
a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.    1.5636360329510388
The death of a man is unique, and yet it is universal. The straight    1.7026049541338664
line would symbolize its uniqueness, the circle its universality. But    1.5636360329510388
how can one figure symbolize both?   Christianity declares that    1.5127085093302464
in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal    1.67495327387791
concur. Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique    1.6065767145351917
and the universal as clearly, or formulated it as precisely, as Irenaeus.    1.6432600607208703
To be the Savior and the Lord, Jesus Christ has to be a historical    1.7026049541338664
individual with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic    1.67495327387791
aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself    1.6432600607208703
with man's history. Yet this utterly individual historical person    1.5127085093302464
must also contain within himself the common history of mankind. His    1.6065767145351917
history is his alone, yet each man must recognize his own history in    1.67495327387791
it. His death is his alone, yet each man can see his own death in the    1.748515906000203
crucifixion of Jesus. Each man can identify himself with the history    1.6065767145351917
and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified    1.6065767145351917
himself with human history and human death, coming as the head of a    1.67495327387791
new humanity. Not a circle, then, nor a straight line, but a spiral    1.67495327387791
represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has    1.67495327387791
motion as well as recurrence. As represented by a spiral, history may,    1.6432600607208703
in some sense, be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event    1.6432600607208703
remains unique. Christ is both unique and universal.   The first    1.5636360329510388
turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam. As    1.67495327387791
Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning,    1.6432600607208703
so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of    1.7026049541338664
Christ. "Whence, then, comes the substance of the first man? From    1.6065767145351917
God's Will and Wisdom, and from virgin earth. For 'God had    1.6065767145351917
not rained', says the Scripture, before man was made, 'and there    1.6065767145351917
was no man to till the earth'. From this earth, then, while it was    1.7026049541338664
still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man, the beginning of humanity".    1.67495327387791
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private    1.5636360329510388
individuals, but as universal human beings, who were and are all of humanity.    1.67495327387791
Adam and Eve were perfect, not in the sense that they possessed    1.6432600607208703
perfection, but in the sense that they were capable of development    1.6065767145351917
toward perfection. They were, in fact, children. Irenaeus does not    1.5636360329510388
claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for    1.6432600607208703
him, as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself with the    1.6432600607208703
fall. Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence    1.67495327387791
of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity    1.6065767145351917
into history. Historical existence is a created good.   The biblical    1.5636360329510388
symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words: "So    1.5636360329510388
God created man in his own image; in the similitude of God he created    1.7026049541338664
him". There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where    1.6065767145351917
the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished, so    1.6065767145351917
most notably in the statement: "If the [Holy] Spirit is absent    1.6065767145351917
from the soul, such a man is indeed of an animal nature; and, being    1.7026049541338664
left carnal, he will be an imperfect being, possessing the image    1.6065767145351917
[of    1.0
God] in his formation, but not receiving the similitude [of God]    1.6065767145351917
through the Spirit". Thus the image of God is that which makes    1.6432600607208703
a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude of God, by contrast,    1.7026049541338664
is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature.    1.748515906000203
Recent research on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that    1.5127085093302464
he does not consistently maintain this distinction. He does not mean    1.6065767145351917
to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through    1.67495327387791
the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly    1.6432600607208703
mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.    1.5636360329510388
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows:    1.3761581156320553
"So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur, and become lifted    1.67495327387791
up, as if he had no lord, because of the dominion that had been    1.7026049541338664
given to him, and the freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator,    1.67495327387791
overstepping his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance    1.6065767145351917
towards God, a law was given him by God, that he might know    1.67495327387791
that he had for lord the lord of all. And He laid down for him certain    1.748515906000203
conditions: so that, if he kept the command of God, then he would    1.67495327387791
always remain as he was, that is, immortal; but if he did not, he    1.7026049541338664
would become mortal, melting into earth, whence his frame had been taken".    1.6432600607208703
These conditions man did not keep, and thus he became mortal;    1.6065767145351917
yet he did not stop being human as a result. There is no justification    1.7026049541338664
for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image    1.5636360329510388
of God beyond this, nor for reading into his imprecise usage the    1.6432600607208703
later theological distinction between the image of God (humanity) and    1.5636360329510388
the similitude of God (immortality).   Man was created with the    1.5636360329510388
capacity for immortality, but the devil's promise of immortality    1.5127085093302464
in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality. He was, in the    1.6432600607208703
words of Irenaeus, "beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality".    1.6065767145351917
The true way to immortality lay through obedience, but man    1.5636360329510388
did not believe this.   "Eve was disobedient; for she did    1.5636360329510388
not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed    1.7269387314284994
a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin **h, having    1.6432600607208703
become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and    1.6432600607208703
to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed    1.67495327387791
[to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become    1.6065767145351917
the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race".    1.6432600607208703
Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere    1.6432600607208703
potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created    1.6065767145351917
as children, Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience    1.5636360329510388
as being "due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still wicked".    1.5636360329510388
His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts    1.6432600607208703
him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin    1.6432600607208703
Mary. That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too;    1.5636360329510388
for as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue man,    1.7026049541338664
so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought    1.7026049541338664
death into the world, and all our woe.   With this act of disobedience,    1.67495327387791
and not with the inception of his individual existence, man    1.5636360329510388
began the downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending from    1.6065767145351917
the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality. At    1.5636360329510388
the nadir of that circuit is death. "Along with the fruit they did    1.67495327387791
also fall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience;    1.67495327387791
and disobedience to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became    1.5636360329510388
forfeit to death, from that [moment] they were handed over to it".    1.6432600607208703
This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam    1.5636360329510388
and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday,    1.7026049541338664
as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday; he sees    1.67495327387791
a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath. In    1.67495327387791
any case, though they had been promised immortality if they ate of    1.6432600607208703
the tree, they obtained mortality instead. The wages of sin is death.    1.6432600607208703
Man's life, originally shaped for immortality and for communion with    1.5636360329510388
God, must now be conformed to the shape of death.   Nevertheless,    1.6065767145351917
even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs    1.6432600607208703
to God, and he still rules. Even death, therefore, has a providential    1.6432600607208703
as well as a punitive function.   "Wherefore also He [God]    1.5636360329510388
drove him [man] out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree    1.67495327387791
of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture    1.7026049541338664
to assert, but because He pitied him, [and did not desire] that    1.6432600607208703
he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin which surrounded    1.67495327387791
him should be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable. But    1.5636360329510388
He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing death, and thus    1.7026049541338664
causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the dissolution of the    1.7026049541338664
flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at    1.67495327387791
length to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God". This    1.7026049541338664
idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well    1.6065767145351917
into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for    1.6432600607208703
the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ.    1.67495327387791
As man can live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that    1.7269387314284994
Christ could bring many to life.   It is probably fair to say    1.6432600607208703
that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of    1.7026049541338664
sin is. This applies to his picture of Adam. It is borne out also    1.7026049541338664
by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation    1.7026049541338664
to the next. It becomes most evident in his description of    1.6065767145351917
Christ as the second Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but    1.67495327387791
whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality. This emphasis    1.5636360329510388
upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus    1.5636360329510388
shares with many early theologians, especially the Greek-speaking ones.    1.5127085093302464
They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility,    1.6432600607208703
which can mean (though it does not have to mean) deliverance from    1.6432600607208703
time and history.   Death reminds man of his sin, but it reminds    1.6432600607208703
him also of his transience. It represents a punishment that he knows    1.6432600607208703
he deserves, but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives    1.6065767145351917
his life within the process of time. These two aspects of death cannot    1.67495327387791
be successfully separated, but they dare not be confused or identified.    1.6065767145351917
The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as    1.5636360329510388
altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of    1.6432600607208703
death cannot be separated. Such efforts almost always find themselves    1.5636360329510388
compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and    1.6432600607208703
then older and then still older, in short, whether Adam's life was    1.6432600607208703
intended to be part of the process of time. If it was, then it must    1.7269387314284994
have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from    1.6432600607208703
time to eternity. One night, so some of these theories run, Adam would    1.67495327387791
have fallen asleep, much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve;    1.67495327387791
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal. The    1.67495327387791
embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an    1.6065767145351917
illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment, for    1.6432600607208703
some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the    1.6432600607208703
natural order of time and change.   On the other hand, Christian    1.6065767145351917
faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal    1.6432600607208703
existence. It is the wages of sin, and its sting is the law.    1.67495327387791
If    1.0
this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea    1.6432600607208703
of death as natural termination, the conclusion seems inevitable that    1.5636360329510388
temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state    1.6432600607208703
into which man is put by the will of the Creator. This seems to have    1.7269387314284994
been the conclusion to which Origen was forced. If death receives    1.6065767145351917
more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives    1.67495327387791
less than its share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ    1.6432600607208703
begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal,    1.6432600607208703
i&e&, created, existence. Such an interpretation of death radically    1.5127085093302464
alters the Christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation    1.5636360329510388
from, not salvation in, time and history. Because Christianity    1.5127085093302464
teaches not only salvation in history, but salvation by the history of    1.6432600607208703
Christ, such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision    1.6065767145351917
of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ.   1.5127085093302464
Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist thinking, it manifestly    1.5127085093302464
is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right    1.6065767145351917
to refuse to accept persons it dislikes. The Unitarian clergy were    1.6065767145351917
an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then understood    1.6432600607208703
in the Back Bay- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman,    1.6065767145351917
either in theology or in manners. Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable    1.6065767145351917
representative of the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the    1.5127085093302464
issue in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated    1.6432600607208703
and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force    1.6432600607208703
could exist. Even so, Gannett judiciously argued, the Association could    1.5636360329510388
legitimately decide that Parker "should not be encouraged nor    1.5127085093302464
assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard    1.67495327387791
to their correctness". We today are not entitled to excoriate    1.5636360329510388
honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who    1.6065767145351917
barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their    1.6432600607208703
congregations.    1.0
One can even argue- though this is a delicate matter-    1.5636360329510388
that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture    1.5636360329510388
to the First Church, and so to suppress it, rather than let Parker    1.67495327387791
use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should    1.67495327387791
come to occupy it. Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen,    1.7026049541338664
as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father,    1.5636360329510388
they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title    1.67495327387791
of Christians. Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for    1.5127085093302464
intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow "free inquiry"    1.6065767145351917
to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a "natural" religion.   1.5127085093302464
Grant all this- still, when modern Unitarianism and    1.4513752902486308
the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults    1.5636360329510388
Parker lavished upon them, or else argue that after all Parker    1.6065767145351917
received the treatment he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience.    1.5636360329510388
Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation    1.5636360329510388
of Parker and the fraternity on January 23, 1843- while it    1.6065767145351917
may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker    1.6065767145351917
leave the Association, while it may plead that Dr& N& L& Frothingham    1.6432600607208703
had every warrant for stating, "The difference between Trinitarians    1.5127085093302464
and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity; the difference    1.5127085093302464
between Mr& Parker and the Association is a difference    1.5127085093302464
between no Christianity and Christianity"- despite these supposed    1.4513752902486308
conclusive assurances, the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh    1.5127085093302464
of relief, of positive thanksgiving, that the Association never quite    1.5636360329510388
brought itself officially to expel Parker. Had it done so, the blot    1.6432600607208703
on its escutcheon would have remained indelible, nor could the Harvard    1.6065767145351917
Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other    1.5127085093302464
than by getting down on its collective knees and crying "peccavi".   1.6065767145351917
Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association did    1.4513752902486308
not actually command Parker to leave the room, though it came too close    1.67495327387791
for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality. Fortunately,    1.6065767145351917
the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol    1.5636360329510388
defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and Chandler    1.5127085093302464
Robbins; whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and    1.5636360329510388
rushed out of the room, though not out of the Fellowship. In the    1.67495327387791
hall, after adjournment, Dr& Frothingham took him warmly by the    1.5636360329510388
hand    1.0
and requested Parker to visit him- whereupon our burly Theodore    1.5636360329510388
again burst into tears.   All this near tragedy, which to us borders    1.6432600607208703
on comedy, enables us to tell the story over and over again, always    1.67495327387791
warming ourselves with a glow of complacency. It was indeed a near    1.6432600607208703
thing, but somehow the inherent decency of New England (which we inherit)    1.6432600607208703
did triumph. Parker was never excommunicated. To the extent    1.5127085093302464
that he was ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by saying    1.6432600607208703
he asked for it. Yet, even after all these stratagems, the conscience    1.6432600607208703
of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest, any more than is    1.67495327387791
the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance    1.6065767145351917
for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School    1.5636360329510388
Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him. In both cases    1.6432600607208703
the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant    1.5636360329510388
apostates, both legitimate offspring of its loins, and when brought    1.5636360329510388
to the test, it behaved shabbily. Suppose they both had ventured into    1.6432600607208703
realms which their colleagues thought infidel: is this the way gentlemen    1.6065767145351917
settle frank differences of opinion? Is it after all possible    1.5636360329510388
that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity    1.6432600607208703
they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any    1.6432600607208703
conservative has ever to worry about?   However, there is a crucial    1.6065767145351917
difference between the two histories. Emerson evaded the problem    1.5127085093302464
by shoving it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked    1.67495327387791
out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick the wound of his    1.7026049541338664
departure, preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious    1.5127085093302464
veneration. Parker insisted upon <not> resigning, even when the majority    1.5636360329510388
wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to throw him    1.6065767145351917
out. Hence he was in his lifetime, as is the memory of him afterwards,    1.7026049541338664
a canker within the liberal sensitivity. He still points an accusing    1.6065767145351917
finger at all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to support    1.7026049541338664
him nor the energy to cut his throat.   Actually, the dispute    1.6065767145351917
between Parker and the society of his time, both ecclesiastical and    1.6065767145351917
social, was a real one, a bitter one. It cannot be smoothed over by    1.7026049541338664
now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or    1.5636360329510388
by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections    1.6432600607208703
to him. The fact is incontestable: that liberal world of Unitarian    1.6065767145351917
Boston <was> narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid    1.3761581156320553
of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm,    1.6065767145351917
and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle    1.6065767145351917
foundations were threatened. Parker, along with Garrison and    1.4513752902486308
Charles Sumner, showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs    1.5636360329510388
mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery. Nevertheless,    1.5636360329510388
we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace;    1.6432600607208703
their passions were genuine, and the division between them and the abolitionists    1.6432600607208703
is clear-cut. But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within    1.5127085093302464
the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository    1.6065767145351917
of liberality poses a different problem, which is not to be resolved by    1.67495327387791
holding him up as the champion of freedom. Even though his theological    1.6432600607208703
theses have become, to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation    1.5127085093302464
he phrased is very much with us. It has been endlessly rephrased,    1.6432600607208703
but I may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves    1.7269387314284994
obliged to become intolerant? And then, as they become aware    1.5636360329510388
that they have reached the end of their patience, what do they, to    1.67495327387791
their dismay, learn for the first time about themselves?   There    1.5636360329510388
can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel    1.67495327387791
in enforcing its canons of behavior. The gentle Channing, revered    1.5636360329510388
by all Bostonians, orthodox or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville    1.6432600607208703
that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant    1.6432600607208703
spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and    1.6065767145351917
action: "No city in the world is governed so little by a police,    1.67495327387791
and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment.    1.6432600607208703
We stand more in awe of one another than most people. Opinion is    1.67495327387791
less individual or runs more into masses, and often rules with a rod    1.67495327387791
of iron". Even more poignantly, and with the insight of a genius,    1.6432600607208703
Channing added- remember, this is Channing, not Parker!-    1.4513752902486308
that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart, should    1.6432600607208703
he "speak without book, and consequently break some law of speech,    1.6065767145351917
or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should find little mercy".   1.6432600607208703
Channing wrote this- in a letter! I think it fair to    1.6065767145351917
say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons. But Theodore    1.67495327387791
Parker, commencing his mission to the world-at-large, disguised    1.4513752902486308
as the minister of a "twenty-eighth Congregational Church" which    1.5127085093302464
bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the    1.5636360329510388
founders (among which were still the Unitarian churches), made explicit    1.5636360329510388
from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish    1.6065767145351917
society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel    1.6065767145351917
difference about clerical decorum. Because he spoke openly with what    1.5636360329510388
Channing had prophesied someone might- with daring hyperbole- Parker    1.5127085093302464
vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed    1.4513752902486308
this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals    1.6065767145351917
were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines.    1.6065767145351917
An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an    1.3761581156320553
institution, and only within those defined limits a license.    1.5127085093302464
By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation, we should,    1.6065767145351917
I am sure, come to a fresh realization, however painful it be, that the    1.7026049541338664
battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest. He    1.6065767145351917
arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had    1.6432600607208703
to respond with, at the least, resentment. What otherwise could "the    1.6065767145351917
lawyer, doctor, minister, the men of science and letters" do when    1.6065767145351917
told that they had "become the cherubim and seraphim and the three    1.6432600607208703
archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant, and continually    1.6432600607208703
cried, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Almighty    1.3761581156320553
Dollar'"?    1.0
Nor, when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan    1.67495327387791
stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should we be    1.6432600607208703
astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of    1.6432600607208703
rage as Parker snarled at them thus: "Talk about the Catholics    1.6065767145351917
voting as the bishop tells! reproach the Catholics for it! You    1.6065767145351917
and I do the same thing. There are a great many bishops who have never    1.7269387314284994
had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre on their head, who appeal not    1.7269387314284994
to the authority of the Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar,    1.67495327387791
a pope much nearer home. Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists,    1.67495327387791
lawyers and other managers, who told the editors what to say and    1.6432600607208703
the preachers what to think". This was war. Parker meant business.    1.6065767145351917
And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended    1.67495327387791
them: "Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria,    1.5127085093302464
and are worse than those who deceived them"- which implied that they    1.6432600607208703
were very bad indeed. It was "<Duty>" he said that his parents    1.6432600607208703
had given him as a rule- beyond even the love that suffused his    1.67495327387791
being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied- and    1.67495327387791
it was duty he would perform, though it cost him acute pain and exhausted    1.7026049541338664
him by the age of fifty. Parker could weep- and he wept astonishingly    1.67495327387791
often and on the slightest provocation- but the psychology of    1.5636360329510388
those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to    1.5636360329510388
massacre his opponents. "If it gave me pleasure to say hard things",    1.6432600607208703
he wrote, "I would shut up forever". We have to tell ourselves    1.6432600607208703
that when Parker spoke in this vein, he believed what he said, because    1.67495327387791
he could continue, "But the TRUTH, which cost me bitter    1.5636360329510388
tears to say, I must speak, though it cost other tears hotter than    1.67495327387791
fire". Because he copiously shed his own tears, and yielded himself    1.6065767145351917
up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England,    1.6432600607208703
he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's    1.6432600607208703
consciences.   Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how    1.6065767145351917
strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very    1.6432600607208703
issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its    1.7269387314284994
Christian survival, that of the literal, factual historicity of the    1.5636360329510388
miracles as reported in the Four Gospels. It is idle to ask why we    1.7026049541338664
are no longer disturbed if somebody, professing the deepest piety,    1.5636360329510388
decides anew    1.0
that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the    1.6432600607208703
water into wine at eleven A& M& on the third of August, A&    1.67495327387791
D& 32. We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed. So we are    1.748515906000203
the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right    1.67495327387791
side in an unnecessary controversy, to salute his courage, and to pass    1.6432600607208703
on, happily forgetting both him and the entire episode. We have not    1.6432600607208703
the leisure, or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was working    1.67495327387791
in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard    1.67495327387791
Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most    1.6065767145351917
formidable instructor, the majesterial Andrews Norton, by saying    1.4513752902486308
that, while he believed Jesus "like other religious teachers", worked    1.5636360329510388
miracles, "I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine".   1.5636360329510388
I have, within the past fifty years, come out of all uncertainty    1.6432600607208703
into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about    1.67495327387791
which I have not a shadow of doubt. It has been my lot all through    1.7269387314284994
life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with    1.6432600607208703
them the deepest and most vital of all questions, the nature of the    1.67495327387791
hope of a life beyond this. I have also constantly engaged in scientific    1.67495327387791
work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science    1.67495327387791
as well as in the religions in the world. In an amateurish, yet in    1.7026049541338664
a very real sense, I have followed the developments of archaeology, geology,    1.6432600607208703
astronomy, herpetology, and mycology with a hearty appreciation    1.4513752902486308
of the advances being made in these fields.   At one time I became    1.67495327387791
disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent    1.67495327387791
inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a "Higher    1.6432600607208703
Criticism" of the Bible, to refute which I felt the need of a better    1.7026049541338664
knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology, for it seemed to me that    1.6432600607208703
to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.   1.748515906000203
Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while    1.5127085093302464
and, like some higher critical friends, trying to continue to use the    1.6432600607208703
Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have    1.7269387314284994
been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations:    1.5636360329510388
attempting to bridge the chasm between an older, reverent, Bible-loving    1.5636360329510388
generation and a critical, doubting, Bible-emancipated race. Although    1.4513752902486308
still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book, I    1.7026049541338664
stood outside shivering in the cold.   In one thing the higher    1.6065767145351917
critics, like the modernists, however, overreached themselves, in claiming    1.5127085093302464
that the Gospel of John was not written in John's time but    1.6432600607208703
well after the first century, perhaps as late as 150 A&D&. Now,    1.6432600607208703
if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word of God speaking    1.7026049541338664
through His servant, it is John's Gospel. To ask me to believe    1.6432600607208703
that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the    1.6432600607208703
events by some admiring follower, and was not inspired directly by the    1.6432600607208703
Spirit of God, is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any    1.7026049541338664
of those recorded in the Bible. Here I took my leave of my learned    1.7026049541338664
friends to step out on another path, to which we might give the modern    1.7026049541338664
name of Pragmatism, or the thing that works. Test it, try it, and    1.67495327387791
if it works, accept it as a guiding principle.   So, I put my    1.67495327387791
Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself, and    1.67495327387791
then tested it to see how it worked. As a short, possibly not the best    1.7269387314284994
method, I looked up "Word" in the Concordance and noted that    1.6065767145351917
the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal    1.67495327387791
message to man. The next traditional step then was to accept it    1.6432600607208703
as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would    1.6432600607208703
accept a treatise on any earthly "science", and I submitted to    1.6065767145351917
its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that,    1.5127085093302464
<"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether    1.7026049541338664
it be of God, or whether I speak of myself"> (John 7:17).   1.6432600607208703
The outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance    1.67495327387791
of the Bible as the Word of God inspired in a sense utterly    1.67495327387791
different from any merely human book, and with it the acceptance of    1.6432600607208703
our Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God, Son of Man    1.7026049541338664
by the Virgin Mary, the Saviour of the world.   I believe,    1.6065767145351917
therefore, that we are without exception sinners, by nature alienated    1.5636360329510388
from God, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth,    1.67495327387791
the representative Head of a new race, to die upon the cross and pay    1.7026049541338664
the penalty of the sin of the world, and that he who thus receives Christ    1.7269387314284994
as his personal Saviour is "born again" spiritually, with new    1.5636360329510388
privileges, appetites, and affections, destined to live and grow in    1.5636360329510388
His likeness forever. Nor can any man save himself by good works or    1.67495327387791
by a commendable "moral life", although such works are the natural    1.6065767145351917
fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally    1.6065767145351917
expressing itself through such avenues.   I now ever look for    1.5636360329510388
Christ acording to His promises and those of the Old Testament as    1.6432600607208703
well, to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness    1.748515906000203
over the whole earth.   To state fully what the Bible    1.5636360329510388
means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to    1.67495327387791
formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and    1.6065767145351917
friends. The Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as    1.67495327387791
bread is food for the body. Again, as faith reveals God my Father    1.67495327387791
and Christ my Saviour, I follow without question where He leads me    1.6432600607208703
daily by His Spirit of love, wisdom, power and prayer. I place His    1.67495327387791
precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability, dismissing    1.5127085093302464
cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed    1.6432600607208703
to Him. I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ,    1.7026049541338664
who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge, and daring to trust Him    1.7026049541338664
even though called to stand alone before the world.   Our Lord's    1.6065767145351917
invitation with its implied promise to all is, "Come and see".   1.6065767145351917
I STOOD at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld    1.6432600607208703
a very sick man in terrible pain. As I ministered to his needs,    1.67495327387791
I noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and I    1.7026049541338664
learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and    1.7026049541338664
nurse but also the Lord.   In his heart he had that peace of which    1.7026049541338664
the Lord spoke when He said, <"Peace I leave with you, my peace    1.67495327387791
I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let    1.7026049541338664
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid">.   What    1.6065767145351917
a joy to realize that we, too, can claim this promise tendered by    1.67495327387791
the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very    1.7026049541338664
dear to Him. He was about to leave them, to depart from this world,    1.7026049541338664
and return to His Father in Heaven. Before He left them He promised    1.67495327387791
that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts    1.6432600607208703
and minds.   I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who    1.67495327387791
has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It makes    1.6432600607208703
my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance    1.7269387314284994
while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.   How    1.5636360329510388
often have I looked to Jesus when entering the sick room, asking    1.6432600607208703
for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents    1.7026049541338664
not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and    1.7026049541338664
His creatures.   Looking unto God, the Prophet Isaiah wrote    1.5127085093302464
these blessed words almost three thousand years ago: <"Thou wilt    1.5636360329510388
keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because    1.6432600607208703
he trusteth in thee">.   Are you longing for peace in your heart?    1.6432600607208703
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours. As only a member    1.67495327387791
of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family, likewise    1.67495327387791
one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits    1.7026049541338664
that are promised to those who are His own.   Perhaps you are    1.6432600607208703
not His child. Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him. You    1.7026049541338664
may know that you are in God's family and be just as sure of it as    1.748515906000203
you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father.    1.6432600607208703
<"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that    1.67495327387791
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life",>    1.6065767145351917
and <"as many as received him, to them gave he power to become    1.67495327387791
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name">.   1.6432600607208703
It is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that    1.7026049541338664
He gives His peace; not that empty peace the world offers, but a deep,    1.7026049541338664
abiding peace which nothing can destroy.   Why not open your    1.5636360329510388
heart to the Lord Jesus Christ now, accept Him as your Saviour    1.6432600607208703
and    1.0
let Him fill you with peace that only He can give.   Then,    1.6432600607208703
with the hymn writer of old, you can say:   "I am resting today    1.67495327387791
in His wonderful peace,   Resting sweetly in Jesus' control.   1.5127085093302464
I am kept from all danger by night and by day,   And    1.6432600607208703
His glory is flooding my soul".   1.2818970554302986
SATELLITES, SPUTNIKS, ROCKETS,    1.0
BALLOONS; what next? Our necks are stiff from gazing at    1.5636360329510388
the wonders of outer space, which have captured the imagination of the    1.6432600607208703
American public. Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth from    1.4513752902486308
the radio, television, and newspaper.   While we are filling    1.5127085093302464
outer space with scientific successes, for many the "inner" space    1.5636360329510388
of their soul is an aching void.   Proof? An average of 50 suicides    1.67495327387791
are reported in America each day! One out of every three or    1.6432600607208703
four marriages end in divorce! Over $200,000,000 is paid yearly to    1.6065767145351917
the 80,000 full-time fortune-tellers in the United States by fearful    1.5636360329510388
mankind who want to "know" what the future holds! Delinquency,    1.5636360329510388
juvenile and adult, is at an all-time high! Further proof? Read    1.6065767145351917
your daily newspaper!   Unfortunately, in our rush to beat    1.5127085093302464
the Russians, we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus Christ:    1.6065767145351917
<"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world>    1.67495327387791
[that includes outer space], <and lose his own soul? Or what    1.6065767145351917
shall a man give in exchange for his soul"?> (Mark 8:36, 37).   1.6432600607208703
Gaining outer space and losing "inner" space is bad business    1.5636360329510388
according to God's standards.   It is true that we must    1.5636360329510388
keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments; only    1.5127085093302464
a fool would think otherwise. But we must not forget man's soul.   1.6432600607208703
Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news    1.67495327387791
that God put His Son,    1.1606783668269585
Jesus Christ, on earth to live and die to    1.5127085093302464
save our hell-bound souls? <"For God so loved the world, that    1.6065767145351917
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should    1.6432600607208703
not perish, but have everlasting life"> (John 3:16).   Never    1.5127085093302464
forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Your spiritual    1.7026049541338664
"inner" space helps determine the spirituality of America    1.4513752902486308
as a nation. We trust you are not one of the 70,000,000 Americans    1.67495327387791
who do not attend church, but who feel that various forms of recreation    1.67495327387791
are more important than worshipping the God who made our country great.   1.6432600607208703
Is forgiveness of past sins, assurance of present help, and    1.5636360329510388
hope of future bliss in your orbit? Or are you trying the devil's    1.67495327387791
substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within? Pleasure,    1.5636360329510388
fame and fortune, drowning your troubles with a drink, and "living    1.6065767145351917
it up" with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry:    1.6432600607208703
they may ease your hunger temporarily, but they'll never take the    1.6065767145351917
place of a satisfying, mouth-watering steak.   So it is spiritually.    1.5636360329510388
No amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will    1.6065767145351917
relieve the gnawing of your "inner" space. Why? Because your    1.5636360329510388
soul was made to be filled with God Himself, not religious functions    1.6432600607208703
"about" Him. Only He can satisfy the deepest longings. That    1.5636360329510388
is why the Bible commands you to <"Taste and see that the Lord    1.67495327387791
is good: blessed> [happy] <is the man that trusteth in him">    1.6065767145351917
(Psalm 34:8).   You can receive God into your heart and life    1.6065767145351917
by a step of personal faith. Accept the sinless Son of God, Jesus    1.67495327387791
Christ, as your own personal Saviour. <"As many as received him>    1.6065767145351917
[Jesus], <to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even    1.67495327387791
to them that believe on his name">    1.3761581156320553
<"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?    1.6432600607208703
the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be    1.67495327387791
afraid"?>    1.0
Psalm 27:1   A certain teacher scheduled a "Fear Party"    1.5127085093302464
for her fourth grade pupils. It was a session at which all the youngsters    1.7026049541338664
were told to express their fears, to get them out in the open    1.67495327387791
where they could talk about them freely. The teacher thought it was    1.6432600607208703
so successful that she asks: "Wouldn't it be helpful to all age    1.6432600607208703
groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their    1.6065767145351917
fears and worries"?   Dr& George W& Crane, a medical    1.5127085093302464
columnist, thinks it would. He says: "That would reduce neurotic    1.5636360329510388
ailments tremendously. Each week an estimated 20 million patients call    1.5636360329510388
upon us doctors. Of this number, 50%, or 10 million patients have    1.6432600607208703
no diagnosable physical ailments whatever. They are 'worry warts'.    1.5127085093302464
Yet they keep running from one physician to another, largely to get    1.6432600607208703
a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles. One of    1.67495327387791
the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus    1.6432600607208703
be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions".   1.6432600607208703
We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to    1.6065767145351917
deal with the problem of fear these days. It must be getting more serious.    1.7026049541338664
People are giving their doctors a hard time. One doctor made    1.6065767145351917
a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles, and    1.67495327387791
he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened;    1.6432600607208703
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely    1.5636360329510388
beyond their control; 12% of them worried about their health,    1.5636360329510388
although their ailments were imaginary; 10% of them worried about    1.5636360329510388
their friends, neighbors, and relatives, most of whom were quite capable    1.6065767145351917
of taking care of themselves. Only 8% of the worries had behind    1.6432600607208703
them real causes which demanded attention.   Well, most of our    1.5636360329510388
fears may be unfounded, but after you discover that fact, you have something    1.67495327387791
else to worry about: Why then do we have these fears? What    1.6432600607208703
is the real cause of them? What is there about us that makes us so    1.7269387314284994
anxious?   Look at the things we do to escape our fears and    1.6432600607208703
to forget our worries. We spend millions of dollars every year on fortune    1.67495327387791
tellers and soothsayers. We spend billions of dollars at the race    1.6065767145351917
tracks, and more billions on other forms of gambling. We spend billions    1.6432600607208703
of dollars on liquor, and many more billions on various forms of    1.6432600607208703
escapist entertainment. We consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers    1.5127085093302464
and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions    1.67495327387791
that are tearing us apart.   A visitor from a more peaceful    1.6065767145351917
country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks, and after    1.7026049541338664
he had seen it all, he said to a friend: "You must be a very    1.7269387314284994
sad people". "Sad" was not the right word, of course. He should    1.6432600607208703
have said "jittery", for that's what we are. And that's worse    1.6065767145351917
than sad. Watch people flock to amusement houses, cocktail lounges,    1.5636360329510388
and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment, which means    1.5127085093302464
an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed    1.67495327387791
to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give    1.6065767145351917
men a few hours of dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell    1.67495327387791
that many of them are running away from something.   In one of    1.6432600607208703
his writings Pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign    1.67495327387791
of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates. Yes,    1.6432600607208703
and as tension mounts in this world, fear is increasing. Does that    1.6432600607208703
explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business?    1.7026049541338664
We have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons,    1.7026049541338664
dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate. I doubt that    1.6065767145351917
"fear parties" and "group confessionals" will help very much.    1.5127085093302464
Suppose we do get our fears out in the open, what then? Isn't that    1.7026049541338664
where most of them are already- right out on the front page of our    1.7026049541338664
newspapers? Maybe we are talking about them too much. The question    1.6065767145351917
is: what are we going to do about them?   Meanwhile, the    1.6065767145351917
enemy will capitalize on our fears, if he can. Hitler did just that    1.67495327387791
23 years ago, building up tensions that first led to a Munich and then    1.7026049541338664
to a world war. The fear of war can make us either too weak to stand    1.748515906000203
and too willing to compromise, or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate    1.67495327387791
for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate. It is    1.67495327387791
said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals    1.6432600607208703
to attack. It could have the same effect on Communists. The President    1.6432600607208703
of the United States has said: "We will never negotiate out    1.6065767145351917
of fear, and we will never fear to negotiate". That is a sound position,    1.7026049541338664
but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely    1.6065767145351917
as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not    1.7677783654484436
afraid. And that's another reason why it is imperative for us these    1.6432600607208703
days to conquer our fears, to develop the poise that promotes peace.   1.6432600607208703
Turning to the Word of God, we find the only sure way to do    1.7026049541338664
that. In Psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful words which you must    1.6432600607208703
have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you,    1.7026049541338664
or to drive them out if they have you in their grip: "The Lord    1.7026049541338664
is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the    1.7026049541338664
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid"?   Well,    1.6065767145351917
you say, those are beautiful words all right, but it was easy for the    1.7026049541338664
psalmist to sing them in his day. He didn't live in a world of perpetual    1.7269387314284994
peril like ours. He didn't know anything about the problems    1.5636360329510388
we face today.   No? Read the next two verses: "When the    1.6065767145351917
wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh,    1.7269387314284994
they stumbled and fell. Though an host should encamp against me, my    1.6432600607208703
heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will    1.67495327387791
I be confident".   That is almost a perfect description of    1.5636360329510388
the predicament in which we find ourselves today, isn't it? Our    1.6065767145351917
enemy is also threatening to devour us. He has already devoured huge    1.6432600607208703
areas of the world, putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains    1.6432600607208703
and barbed wire, reducing them to slavery, systematically crushing    1.5127085093302464
not only their bodies but their souls, and shooting them to death if they    1.7026049541338664
try to escape their prison. Yes indeed, we too can see a warlike    1.67495327387791
host of infidels encamped against us.   What a terrible thing, that    1.6065767145351917
"wailing wall" in Berlin! A man with a baby in his arms stood    1.67495327387791
there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest    1.7026049541338664
of the family. Another man tried to swim across the river from the East    1.7026049541338664
to the West, but was shot and killed. A middle aged woman opened    1.67495327387791
a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall,    1.7026049541338664
she threw out a few belongings and then jumped; she was fatally injured.    1.67495327387791
The entrance to a church has been walled up, so that the congregation,    1.67495327387791
most of which is in the western sector, cannot worship God there    1.6432600607208703
anymore. Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends    1.5127085093302464
that live in the opposite part of the city. People stand at the wall    1.7026049541338664
giving vent to their feelings, weeping, pounding it with their fists,    1.6065767145351917
pleading for loved ones. But the enemy answers them from loudspeakers    1.6065767145351917
that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible    1.6065767145351917
profanity. There is only one escape left, a tragic one, and too    1.6432600607208703
many people are taking it: suicide. The normal rate of suicides in    1.6432600607208703
East Berlin was one a day, but since the border was closed on August    1.7026049541338664
13 it has jumped to 25 a day!   These things may be happening    1.67495327387791
many miles away from us but really they are right next door. We are    1.7026049541338664
all involved in them, deeply involved. And nobody knows what comes next.    1.6432600607208703
We live from crisis to crisis. And there is only one way for a    1.7026049541338664
man to conquer his fears in such a world. He must learn to say with    1.7269387314284994
true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world: "The Lord    1.6432600607208703
is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the    1.7026049541338664
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid"?   1.5636360329510388
Notice    1.0
that this man had a threefold conception of God which is the secret    1.67495327387791
of his faith. First, "the Lord is my <light>". He lived in a    1.67495327387791
very dark world, but he was not in the dark. The same God who called    1.7269387314284994
this world into being when He said: "Let there be light"!-    1.6065767145351917
those were His very first creative words- He began the world with    1.6432600607208703
light- this God still gives light to a world which man has plunged    1.67495327387791
into darkness. For those who put their trust in Him He still says    1.67495327387791
every day again: "Let there be light"! And there is light!   1.6065767145351917
In fact, He came into this world Himself, in the person of    1.6432600607208703
His Son, Jesus Christ, who stood here amid the darkness of human    1.6432600607208703
sin and said: "I am the light of the world: he that followeth    1.67495327387791
me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life". The    1.7026049541338664
psalmist could say that God was his light even though he could only    1.67495327387791
anticipate the coming of Christ. He lived in the dawn; he could    1.6432600607208703
only see the light coming over the horizon. We live in the bright daylight    1.7026049541338664
of that great event; for us it is a fact in history. Why should    1.7026049541338664
we not have the same faith, and an even greater experience of the light    1.7026049541338664
which it gives?   This is the faith that moved the psalmist    1.6065767145351917
to add his second conception of God: "The Lord is **h my <salvation>".    1.67495327387791
He knew that his God would save him from his enemies    1.6065767145351917
because He had saved him from his sins. If God could do that, He could    1.7269387314284994
do anything. The enemies at his gate, threatening to eat up his    1.6432600607208703
flesh, were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul.    1.67495327387791
And God had conquered that one by His grace! So why worry about    1.67495327387791
all the others?   The apostle Paul said the same thing in the    1.6432600607208703
language and faith of the New Testament: "He that spared not    1.6065767145351917
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with    1.7269387314284994
Him freely give us all things? **h If God be for us, who can be    1.7269387314284994
against us? **h Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?    1.6432600607208703
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,    1.5636360329510388
or peril, or sword"? (Romans 8:31, 32, 35)   Salvation!    1.5127085093302464
This is the key to    1.1606783668269585
the conquest of fear. This gets down to the heart of our problem, for    1.7026049541338664
it reconciles us with God, whom we fear most of all because we have    1.7026049541338664
sinned against Him. When that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus    1.67495327387791
Christ, when we know that He is our Savior, that He has paid our    1.7026049541338664
debt with His blood, that He has met the demands of God's justice    1.67495327387791
and thus has turned His wrath away- when we know that, we have peace    1.7026049541338664
with God in our hearts; and then, with this God on our side,    1.67495327387791
we can face the whole world without fear.   And so the psalmist    1.6432600607208703
gives us one more picture of God: "The Lord is the <strength>    1.6432600607208703
of my life". The word is really "stronghold". It recalls those    1.6065767145351917
words of another psalm: "God is our refuge and strength, a very    1.6432600607208703
present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth    1.6432600607208703
be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the    1.67495327387791
sea **h Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations He    1.6432600607208703
hath made in the earth.    1.1606783668269585
But, again, we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until    1.67495327387791
the close of the ninth century A&D&, when an Arabic scholar, Tabit    1.6432600607208703
ibn Korra (836-901) is said to have discussed the magic square of    1.6432600607208703
three. Thus, while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or    1.5636360329510388
the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before    1.6432600607208703
the Chinese did, more definite evidence will have to turn up from    1.6432600607208703
the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her    1.6432600607208703
claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years.    1.67495327387791
The    1.0
concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace, strong and united under a    1.6432600607208703
forceful ruler, which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of    1.67495327387791
the    1.0
Warring States, was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese    1.6065767145351917
Empire under the Ch'in dynasty (221-207 B&C&). But this    1.5127085093302464
was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian    1.5636360329510388
despotism. Among the many severe measures taken by the First Emperor,    1.6065767145351917
Shih Huang-ti, in his efforts to insure the continuation of    1.5636360329510388
this hard-won national unity, was the burning of the books in 213 B&C&,    1.67495327387791
with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for    1.5127085093302464
divergent thinking; but, as he had a special fondness for magic and    1.6432600607208703
divination, he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared.    1.6065767145351917
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn, during the burning    1.6432600607208703
of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later; yet some must have    1.67495327387791
survived, because the old interest in number symbolism, divination,    1.5127085093302464
and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty, which succeeded in reuniting    1.6432600607208703
China and keeping it together for a longer period (from 202 B&C&    1.6432600607208703
to A&D& 220). In fact, during    1.2818970554302986
the first century B&C&, an extensive literature sprang up devoted    1.5636360329510388
to these subjects, finding its typical expression in the so-called    1.5636360329510388
"<wei> books", a number of which were specifically devoted to    1.5636360329510388
the <Lo Shu> and related numerical diagrams, especially in connection    1.5636360329510388
with divination. However, the <wei> books were also destroyed    1.5127085093302464
in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final    1.6432600607208703
proscription in 605.   After all this destruction of old literature,    1.5636360329510388
it should be obvious why we have so little information about the    1.6432600607208703
early history and development of the <Lo Shu>, which was already    1.6065767145351917
semisecret anyhow. But, in spite of all this, enough evidence remains    1.6065767145351917
to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object    1.7026049541338664
of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching fullest    1.6065767145351917
expression in the Han period.   Although modern scholars have    1.5127085093302464
expressed surprise that "the simple magic square of three", a mere    1.6065767145351917
"mathematical puzzle", was able to exert a considerable influence    1.5127085093302464
on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries,    1.67495327387791
they could have found most of the answers right within the square    1.6432600607208703
itself. But, up to now, no one has attempted to analyze its inherent    1.67495327387791
mathematical properties, or the numerical significance of its numbers-    1.5127085093302464
singly or in combination- and then tried to consider these in    1.6065767145351917
the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts.   Such an analysis    1.5636360329510388
speedily reveals why the middle number of the <Lo Shu>, 5,    1.6065767145351917
was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints    1.6432600607208703
that they had a knowledge of this diagram. The importance of this    1.6432600607208703
5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of    1.6065767145351917
the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the    1.67495327387791
numbers- quite apart from any numerological considerations, which is    1.5127085093302464
to say, any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it. Indeed, mathematically    1.6065767145351917
speaking, it was both functionally and symbolically the most    1.5127085093302464
important number in the entire diagram.   If one takes the middle    1.6065767145351917
number, 5, and multiplies it by 3 (the base number of the magic    1.67495327387791
square of three), the result is 15, which is also the constant sum of    1.7026049541338664
all the rows, columns, and two main diagonals. Then, if the middle number    1.67495327387791
is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square, through    1.6432600607208703
multiplying it by the highest number, 9 (which is the square of    1.6432600607208703
the base number), the result is 45; and the latter is the total sum    1.7026049541338664
of all the numbers in the square, by which all the other numbers are    1.7026049541338664
overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed.   Furthermore,    1.6432600607208703
the middle number of the <Lo Shu> is not only the physical    1.6432600607208703
mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers, by reason of    1.6432600607208703
its central position; it is also their mathematical mean, since it    1.6065767145351917
is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair, all of which equal 10.    1.7269387314284994
In fact, the neat balance of these pairs, and their subtle equilibrium,    1.6432600607208703
would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese.    1.6432600607208703
For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female,    1.7026049541338664
equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature;    1.6432600607208703
and in this square, the respective pairs made up of large and    1.6432600607208703
small odd (Yang) numbers, and those composed of large and small even    1.6432600607208703
(Yin) numbers, were all equal to each other. Thus all differences were    1.6432600607208703
leveled, and all contrasts erased, in a realm of no distinction, and    1.6432600607208703
the harmonious balance of the <Lo Shu> square could effectively    1.5636360329510388
symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.   1.6065767145351917
The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the <Lo Shu> square-    1.6065767145351917
for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that this number so    1.6065767145351917
neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe, could well explain    1.6432600607208703
why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5, and    1.67495327387791
why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality. These twin    1.67495327387791
tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty.   1.6065767145351917
The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further    1.5636360329510388
stimulated toward the close of the second century B&C&, when    1.5636360329510388
the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow-    1.6432600607208703
which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions-    1.5127085093302464
and took 5 as the dynastic number, believing that he would thus    1.6432600607208703
place himself, his imperial family, and the nation under the most auspicious    1.6432600607208703
influences. His immediate motive for doing this may not have    1.5636360329510388
been directly inspired by the <Lo Shu>, but this measure must inevitably    1.6432600607208703
have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.   1.5127085093302464
After this time, inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors, as well    1.6065767145351917
as other writings, emphasized the desirability of keeping one's    1.5127085093302464
self at the center of the universe, where cosmic forces were strongest.    1.6432600607208703
Later, we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too    1.67495327387791
literally.   All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number    1.5636360329510388
5 as a symbolic expression of the Center, which seems to have begun    1.67495327387791
as far back as 400 B&C&, also may conceivably have led to the development    1.7026049541338664
of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to    1.5127085093302464
fit everything into numerical categories of five. We find, for example,    1.6065767145351917
such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers, the Five Sacred Mountains,    1.6065767145351917
the Five Directions (with Center), the Five Metals, Five    1.5127085093302464
Colors, Five Tastes, Five Odors, Five Musical Notes, Five    1.5127085093302464
Bodily Functions, Five Viscera, and many others. This trend has    1.5636360329510388
often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself, as though    1.67495327387791
they had served as the base for all the rest; but why did the Old    1.7269387314284994
Chinese postulate <five> elements, when the Ancient Near East-    1.5127085093302464
which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence    1.6065767145351917
in human life and activities- recognized only four? And why    1.5636360329510388
did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions,    1.6065767145351917
when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only    1.6432600607208703
the usual four? Obviously, something suddenly caused them to start    1.5636360329510388
thinking in terms of fives, and that may have been the workings of    1.67495327387791
the <Lo Shu>.   This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect    1.5636360329510388
on Chinese thinking. Whereas the primary meanings of the <Lo Shu>    1.6065767145351917
diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties-    1.6065767145351917
and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on    1.6065767145351917
some mathematical bases- the urgent desire to place everything into    1.5636360329510388
categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers, until    1.6432600607208703
an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought.    1.5127085093302464
Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature,    1.6432600607208703
or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things, in a fashion that    1.6065767145351917
seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical, and    1.5636360329510388
philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought    1.6065767145351917
in China for many centuries.    1.1606783668269585
Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle    1.4513752902486308
number at the center of the <Lo Shu>, and the interrelation    1.6065767145351917
of all the other numbers to it, might seem enough to account for the deep    1.7269387314284994
fascination which the <Lo Shu> held for the Old Chinese philosophers,    1.6065767145351917
this was actually only a beginning of wonders. For the <Lo    1.6065767145351917
Shu> square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief    1.6432600607208703
religious and philosophical ideas of its time. As such, one cannot    1.6065767145351917
fully understand the thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without    1.6065767145351917
knowing the meanings inherent in the <Lo Shu>; but, conversely,    1.5636360329510388
one cannot begin to understand the <Lo Shu> without knowing something    1.6065767145351917
about the world view of the Old Chinese, which they felt they    1.6432600607208703
saw expressed in it.   The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty,    1.6432600607208703
when the <Lo Shu> seems to have been at the height of its    1.67495327387791
popularity, was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang    1.6432600607208703
and Five-Elements School, which was traditionally founded by Tsou    1.5127085093302464
Yen. According to this doctrine, the universe was ruled by Heaven,    1.6065767145351917
<T'ien>- as a natural force, or in the personification of a Supreme    1.6432600607208703
Sky-god- governing all things by means of a process called the    1.6065767145351917
<Tao>,    1.0
which can be roughly interpreted as "the Order of the Universe"    1.6065767145351917
or "the Universal Way". Heaven, acting through the Tao,    1.5127085093302464
expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles,    1.6065767145351917
the Yin and the Yang. The Yang, or male principle, was the source    1.67495327387791
of light, heat, and dynamic vitality, associated with the Sun; while    1.6065767145351917
the Yin, or female principle, flourished in darkness, cold, and quiet    1.6065767145351917
inactivity, and was associated with the Moon. Together these two    1.5636360329510388
principles influenced all things, and in varying combinations they were    1.5636360329510388
present in everything.   We have already seen that odd numbers    1.5636360329510388
were considered as being Yang, while the even numbers were Yin, so    1.6432600607208703
that the eight outer numbers of the <Lo Shu> represented these two    1.6432600607208703
principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center. During    1.5127085093302464
the Han dynasty, another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the <Lo    1.6065767145351917
Shu>, considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China. Instead    1.6065767145351917
of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine    1.6432600607208703
Provinces, as was usually    1.0
done, this equated the odd, Yang numbers    1.3761581156320553
with mountains (firm and resistant, hence Yang) and the even numbers    1.6065767145351917
with rivers (sinuous and yielding, hence Yin); taking the former    1.5636360329510388
from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from    1.67495327387791
the principal river systems of Old China.   Thus the middle    1.5636360329510388
number, 5, represented Sung-Shan in Honan, Central China; the    1.5127085093302464
3, T'ai-Shan in Shantung, East China; the 7, Hwa-Shan in Shensi,    1.6065767145351917
West China; the 1, Heng-Shan in Hopei, North China (or    1.5636360329510388
the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi); and the    1.6065767145351917
9, Huo-Shan in Anhwei, which was then the South Sacred Mountain.    1.6065767145351917
For the rivers, the 4 represented the Huai, to the (then) Southeast;    1.6432600607208703
the 2, the San Kiang (three rivers) in the (then) Southwest;    1.6065767145351917
the 8, the Chi in the Northeast; and the 6, the (upper) Yellow River    1.7026049541338664
in the Northwest.   Note that by Western standards this    1.5127085093302464
plan was "upside down", as it put North at the bottom and South    1.67495327387791
at the top, with the other directions correspondingly altered; but in    1.6065767145351917
this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention    1.5636360329510388
for all maps. The same arrangement was used when the <Lo Shu> was    1.67495327387791
equated with the Nine Provinces; and whenever the <Lo Shu>    1.5636360329510388
involved directional symbolism, it was oriented in this same fashion.    1.5636360329510388
Few persons who join the Church are insincere. They earnestly desire    1.6065767145351917
to do the will of God. When they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve    1.748515906000203
Christian stature, it is an <indictment of the Church>. These    1.5636360329510388
fatalities are dramatic evidence of "halfway evangelism", a failure    1.5127085093302464
to follow through. A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can    1.5636360329510388
end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless    1.6432600607208703
practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active    1.67495327387791
fellowship.   The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not    1.5127085093302464
completed when all of the persons on the Responsibility List have    1.6065767145351917
been interviewed. In the average situation about one-third of those visited    1.6065767145351917
make commitments to Christ and the Church. The pastor and the    1.6065767145351917
Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee <must follow    1.3761581156320553
through> immediately with a carefully planned program. The first thirty    1.5636360329510388
to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine    1.5636360329510388
their interest and participation in the life of the Church. Neglect    1.6065767145351917
means spiritual paralysis or death.    1.1606783668269585
CHURCHES THAT HAVE a carefully planned program of membership preparation    1.5636360329510388
and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members    1.67495327387791
loyal and active. This is the answer to the problem of "membership    1.6432600607208703
delinquency".   It is important that persons desiring to    1.4513752902486308
unite with the Church be <prepared> for this experience so that it    1.6432600607208703
may be meaningful and spiritually significant. It is unfair and unchristian    1.6065767145351917
to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership    1.6432600607208703
before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.   1.5127085093302464
Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after    1.3761581156320553
the commitment is received. _1)_ The pastor <writes a personal letter>    1.6065767145351917
to each individual, expressing his joy over the decision, assuring    1.5636360329510388
him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time, and outlining    1.6432600607208703
the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday.    1.5127085093302464
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported    1.6432600607208703
by the visitors. It should not be postponed later than the next day.    1.67495327387791
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter. _2)_ The pastor    1.6432600607208703
calls in the home of each individual or family for a <spiritual guidance    1.67495327387791
conference>. If possible, he should make an appointment in order    1.5636360329510388
that all persons involved may be present. This is <not> a social    1.6432600607208703
call. It is definitely a "spiritual guidance conference". He    1.5127085093302464
will discuss the significance of Christian commitment, the necessity    1.5127085093302464
of family religion and private devotions, and the importance of the    1.6065767145351917
membership preparation sessions. There may be problems of conduct or    1.5636360329510388
questions of belief which will require his counsel. Each conference    1.5636360329510388
should be concluded naturally with prayer. A piece of devotional material,    1.6065767145351917
such as <The Upper Room>, may be left in each home. _3)_    1.6432600607208703
A minimum of <four sessions of preparation for membership> is necessary    1.6065767145351917
for adults. Some churches require more. None should ask less.    1.5636360329510388
Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the    1.7026049541338664
meaning of Christian discipleship <before> they take the sacred    1.5127085093302464
vows. They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper    1.67495327387791
devotion to it if membership requires something of them.   Many    1.5636360329510388
churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time    1.6432600607208703
for adult preparation classes. Others meet on Sunday night, at the    1.6065767145351917
mid-week service, or for a series of four nights. Some pastors have    1.6432600607208703
two sessions in one evening, with a refreshment period between.    1.5636360329510388
The sessions should cover four major areas: _A_- The Christian    1.5636360329510388
Faith _B_- History of the Church _C_- Duties of Church    1.5636360329510388
Membership _D_- The Local Church and Its Program   1.4513752902486308
Following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing    1.5127085093302464
with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the    1.67495327387791
week. This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership    1.6432600607208703
packet.    1.0
MOST PASTORS FIND    1.0
that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore    1.6432600607208703
hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday. In this session    1.67495327387791
the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the    1.5127085093302464
work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the    1.67495327387791
local church. The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak    1.67495327387791
on the various phases of church life, service opportunities, the church    1.6065767145351917
school, missions, men's work, women's work, youth program, social    1.5127085093302464
activities, and finances. The budget of the church may be presented    1.6065767145351917
and pledges solicited at this session. An "interest finder" or    1.5636360329510388
"talent sheet" may be filled out by each person. (See sample on    1.6432600607208703
pp& 78-79.) The fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the    1.67495327387791
church facilities and refreshments. The social time gives an opportunity    1.5636360329510388
for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members.    1.5636360329510388
IN CONDUCTING    1.0
the Membership Preparation-Inquirers' Class, the pastor should    1.3761581156320553
plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest    1.6432600607208703
on the part of the class. The following have been found effective.    1.6432600607208703
_1)_ <Extend the number of classes>. Some churches have    1.5127085093302464
six or more training sessions of two hours each, generally held on Sunday    1.67495327387791
night or during the week. This gives greater opportunity for the    1.6065767145351917
learning process. _2)_ <Use dramatization>- for example, in    1.4513752902486308
discussing the Lord's Supper or church symbolism. _3)_ <Use    1.5127085093302464
audio-visual aids>. Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion    1.5127085093302464
pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to    1.5127085093302464
enrich the class session. _4)_ <Have a "Question Box>".    1.5127085093302464
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly. Urge them    1.6065767145351917
to write out their questions for the box. _5)_ <Use a textbook>    1.6432600607208703
with assigned readings each week. _6)_ <Select class members for    1.5636360329510388
reports> on various phases of the study. _7)_ <Conduct examinations>,    1.5636360329510388
using a true-false check sheet. _8)_ <Ask each member    1.5127085093302464
to write a statement> on such topics as: "What Christ Means to    1.6432600607208703
Me", "What the Church Means to Me", "Why Join the Church",    1.6065767145351917
"The Duties of Church Members", etc&. _9)_ <Assign    1.4513752902486308
a series of catechism questions> to be memorized. _10)_ <Invite    1.5636360329510388
class members to share in an extra period of Bible study> each    1.6432600607208703
week. _11)_ <Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty>    1.6432600607208703
to the Reception Service.    1.0
THERE    1.0
IS A GROWING CONVICTION among pastors and Church leaders that    1.5636360329510388
all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory    1.6432600607208703
training, including those coming by transfer of membership. George E&    1.5636360329510388
Sweazey writes: "There is danger in trying to make admission    1.5636360329510388
to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know    1.6432600607208703
that anything has happened".   People appreciate experiences    1.3761581156320553
that demand something of them. Those who transfer their membership are    1.6065767145351917
no exception to the rule. For most of them, it will be their first    1.7026049541338664
experience in membership training, since this is a recent development    1.5636360329510388
in many churches. Those coming from other denominations will welcome    1.5636360329510388
the opportunity to become informed.   The preparatory class is    1.5127085093302464
an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted    1.5636360329510388
with one another. It provides a natural transition into the life    1.6065767145351917
of the local church and its organizations.    1.3761581156320553
THE TOTAL PROCESS of evangelism reaches the crescendo    1.4513752902486308
when the group of new members stands before the congregation to    1.6065767145351917
declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship    1.6065767145351917
of the Church. This should be a high moment in their lives, a    1.67495327387791
never-to-be-forgotten    1.0
experience. They should sense the tremendous significance    1.3761581156320553
of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our    1.5636360329510388
Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.   1.67495327387791
Every detail of the service merits careful attention- the    1.5127085093302464
hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of fellowship, the introduction    1.6432600607208703
to the congregation, the welcome of the congregation. This is    1.5636360329510388
a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation. It will help    1.6432600607208703
to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church. It    1.6432600607208703
can mean the difference between participation and inaction, spiritual    1.5127085093302464
growth and decay.   The worship service is the natural and logical    1.6065767145351917
time to receive new members into the Church. The atmosphere for    1.6065767145351917
this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the    1.5636360329510388
worship experience. Psychologically the reception should be the    1.4513752902486308
climax, following the sermon. _1)_ Ask the new members to meet thirty    1.6432600607208703
minutes before the service to complete "talent sheets" and pledge    1.5636360329510388
cards. Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the    1.5636360329510388
chronological membership register. Provide a <name card> for each    1.5127085093302464
new member. Outline plans for the entire service. _2)_ Arrange a    1.6065767145351917
reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together.    1.6432600607208703
Sponsors may sit with them also. _3)_ Invite sponsors or Fellowship    1.6065767145351917
Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service.    1.6432600607208703
_4)_ Give each new member a certificate of membership. _5)_    1.5636360329510388
Introduce each new member to the congregation, asking him to face    1.6065767145351917
the congregation. _6)_ Lead the congregation in a response of    1.5636360329510388
welcome. _7)_ Have a reception for new members in the parlor or    1.6432600607208703
social hall immediately after the service. _8)_ Take a picture of    1.6065767145351917
the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the    1.748515906000203
bulletin board. _9)_ Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with    1.5636360329510388
new members as guests.    1.0
THE CHURCH is "the family of God".    1.3761581156320553
The members of the "family" are drawn together by a common love    1.6432600607208703
for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom. Every member    1.6065767145351917
of the family must have a vital place in its life. This is no spectator-type    1.7269387314284994
experience; everyone is to be a participant.   Yet the    1.5127085093302464
most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right    1.6065767145351917
at this point- helping new members to become participating, growing    1.5636360329510388
parts of the fellowship. Very easily they may be neglected and eventually    1.6432600607208703
join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.   A study    1.5636360329510388
of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period    1.5127085093302464
revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who    1.6432600607208703
joined the Church were <lost to the Church within seven years>. One    1.6432600607208703
denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the    1.6065767145351917
period under study, and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991-    1.6432600607208703
a net growth of only 122,158. Yet during the same period there    1.6432600607208703
were 1,080,062 additions. Another major church body had 4,499,608    1.5127085093302464
members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444. During    1.6065767145351917
this time 4,122,354 new members were brought into the fellowship.    1.5636360329510388
Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago. During    1.5636360329510388
this period 7,484,268 members were received, yet the net membership    1.5636360329510388
now is only 9,910,741. These figures indicate that we are losing    1.6065767145351917
almost as many as we are receiving into membership.   This problem    1.6065767145351917
is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the    1.6432600607208703
active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.    1.67495327387791
Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where population    1.5636360329510388
is expanding, show that numbers of churches have had little net    1.6065767145351917
increase, though many new members were received. Something is wrong when    1.6065767145351917
these things happen. The local "family of God" has failed its    1.6065767145351917
new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare.    1.5636360329510388
NEW MEMBERS <can> become participating, growing    1.2818970554302986
members. But this will not happen merely through the natural process    1.6065767145351917
of social life. It must be planned and carefully developed. The    1.6065767145351917
entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part    1.6432600607208703
in this dynamic process.   If the church has followed the plan    1.6065767145351917
of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership    1.6065767145351917
preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process of assimilation    1.6065767145351917
and growth will be well under way. Those who enter the <front    1.6432600607208703
door> of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will    1.5636360329510388
not so easily step through the <back door> because of lost interest.   1.6432600607208703
However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment    1.6065767145351917
and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship. When    1.5636360329510388
they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction    1.67495327387791
of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into    1.6065767145351917
effective Christians.   The Church expects certain things of    1.4513752902486308
those who become members. The new members justifiably expect some things    1.6065767145351917
from their church family:  - Welcome into the fellowship    1.4513752902486308
  - Sincere Christian love and understanding  - Inspiring    1.2818970554302986
and challenging worship experiences  - Social and recreational    1.3761581156320553
activities  - Opportunities for Christian service    1.1606783668269585
  - Opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible    1.5636360329510388
  - Creative prayer experiences  - Guidance in Christian    1.2818970554302986
social concerns   1.0
MEN need unity and they need God. Care must be taken neither    1.6432600607208703
to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas    1.6065767145351917
about him, but with these two qualifications, the statement stands.    1.5636360329510388
The statement also points to a classic paradox: The more men turn    1.6432600607208703
toward God, who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but    1.7026049541338664
also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established,    1.6432600607208703
the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one    1.6432600607208703
another. To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map    1.7026049541338664
and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political    1.6065767145351917
ones, with a resultant fragmentation of the human race. Massacres    1.5636360329510388
attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State    1.6065767145351917
of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such    1.6065767145351917
divisions can engender. The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly    1.5636360329510388
to    1.0
mind: "Oh how we hate one another for the love of God"!   1.6432600607208703
The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify. It lies    1.6432600607208703
in institutions. Institutions require structure, form, and definition,    1.4513752902486308
and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion. A completely    1.5636360329510388
amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms; to escape    1.5636360329510388
this fate, it must rule some things out. For every criterion which    1.6432600607208703
defines what something is, at the same time proclaims- implicitly if    1.6065767145351917
not openly- what that something is not. Some persons are so sensitive    1.6432600607208703
to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether;    1.67495327387791
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while    1.6065767145351917
being religious may have a certain justification, we ought to dispense    1.6065767145351917
with churches. The suggestion is naive. Man is at once a gregarious    1.6432600607208703
animal and a form-creating being. Having once committed himself to    1.5636360329510388
an ideal which he considers worthwhile, he inevitably creates forms    1.5636360329510388
for its expression and institutions for its continuance. To propose that    1.6065767145351917
men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing    1.5636360329510388
that they be learned without having schools. Both eventualities    1.5127085093302464
are possible logically, but practically they are impossible. As much    1.5636360329510388
as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God, they instrumentally    1.67495327387791
require the institutions that will direct their steps toward    1.5127085093302464
him.   Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men    1.6065767145351917
at odds with their fellows. Is there any way out of the predicament?    1.67495327387791
The only way that I can see is through communication. Interfaith    1.6065767145351917
communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited    1.5636360329510388
upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our    1.6065767145351917
adversaries. Approached creatively, it is a high art. It is the art    1.6432600607208703
of relating the finite to the infinite, of doing our best to insure that    1.7026049541338664
the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not    1.4513752902486308
thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary.    1.6432600607208703
In a certain sense, interfaith communication parallels diplomatic    1.4513752902486308
communication among the nation-states.   What are the pertinent    1.4513752902486308
facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history?    1.5636360329510388
I shall touch on three areas: personal, national, and theological.    1.5636360329510388
By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality    1.5127085093302464
structure. Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological    1.5127085093302464
differences at all, but by the need of men to have persons they    1.67495327387791
can blame, distrust, denounce, and even hate. Such needs may rise    1.6065767145351917
to pathological proportions. Modern psychology has shown that paralleling    1.5127085093302464
"the authoritarian personality" is "the bigoted personality"    1.3761581156320553
in which insecurity, inferiority, suspicion, and distrust combine    1.4513752902486308
to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured    1.67495327387791
if it does not exist naturally. Fortunately the number of    1.5636360329510388
pathological bigots appears to be quite small, but it would be a mistake    1.67495327387791
to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the    1.67495327387791
rest of us. To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices    1.6065767145351917
attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us.   Interfaith    1.67495327387791
conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most    1.5127085093302464
unfortunate of all, for they have no redeeming features whatsoever.    1.5636360329510388
It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must    1.7269387314284994
learn to recognize when it is they, rather than pretexts for them,    1.6432600607208703
that are causing the trouble, and do everything possible to nurture the    1.6432600607208703
healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies.    1.5636360329510388
While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith    1.3761581156320553
conflict may be perennial, nationalism is more variable. The    1.5127085093302464
specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian version which    1.6065767145351917
has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century.   1.6432600607208703
Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination, the    1.5127085093302464
Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires.    1.6065767145351917
No less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence    1.5127085093302464
since World War /2,, and the number is growing by the year. As    1.67495327387791
an obvious consequence, obstacles to genuine interfaith communication    1.4513752902486308
have grown more formidable in one important area: relations between    1.5636360329510388
Christians and non-Christians in these lands. Colonialism alone would    1.5127085093302464
have been able to make these difficulties serious, for Christianity    1.5636360329510388
is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that    1.67495327387791
repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation    1.5636360329510388
of the other. Actually, however, this turns out to be only part of    1.67495327387791
the picture. Nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign    1.6065767145351917
religions but the revival of native ones, some of which had been lying    1.67495327387791
in slumber for centuries. The truth is that any revival of traditional    1.6432600607208703
and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity    1.6065767145351917
and <Volksgeist> which these young nations very much need. Insofar    1.5636360329510388
as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life    1.6065767145351917
which constitute ultimate, trans-political justifications for their existence,    1.4513752902486308
such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which    1.6065767145351917
these traditions and ways are <theirs> rather than someone else's.   1.5636360329510388
All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural    1.5127085093302464
communication for which Christian missions stand. Africans and Asians    1.5127085093302464
tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have    1.6432600607208703
produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not    1.6432600607208703
of direct political propaganda. The people hardest hit by this suspicion    1.6065767145351917
are, of course, Christians on the mainland of China. But the    1.6065767145351917
problem extends elsewhere. For example, in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists    1.6065767145351917
argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion.    1.5636360329510388
In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly Christian-    1.4513752902486308
schools, to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and    1.6065767145351917
the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics. Again, India has imposed    1.6065767145351917
formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries,    1.4513752902486308
and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against    1.6065767145351917
Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru    1.5636360329510388
and his followers is gone.   The progressive closing of Afro-Asian    1.5636360329510388
ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation    1.5636360329510388
I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo. I was    1.67495327387791
seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world    1.6065767145351917
radio program. He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable    1.67495327387791
number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio    1.6432600607208703
networks, but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them.    1.67495327387791
After returning to the United States and raising the money, he    1.6065767145351917
discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available.    1.67495327387791
It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval;    1.6432600607208703
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes.    1.5636360329510388
It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost    1.7269387314284994
vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures    1.5127085093302464
and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this    1.6065767145351917
heightening of anti-Christian sentiment. Ironically, these are the    1.4513752902486308
groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since    1.5636360329510388
World War /2,, while the more established denominations are barely    1.5636360329510388
maintaining pre-war staffs.   Although I have emphasized the    1.4513752902486308
barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between    1.5636360329510388
Christians and non-Christians in Asia, the fact is that this development    1.6065767145351917
has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-Asian religions    1.5127085093302464
themselves. The partition of India has hardly improved relations    1.5127085093302464
between Hindus and Muslims; neither has the establishment of the    1.5636360329510388
I turn finally to several theological developments. _1._ <Theocracy    1.5127085093302464
reconsidered>. The modern world has been marked by progressive    1.5127085093302464
disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state, whatever    1.5636360329510388
its political form. The American Constitution was historic at    1.5127085093302464
this point in providing that "Congress shall make no law respecting    1.6065767145351917
an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof".    1.5636360329510388
One of our foremost jurists, David Dudley Field, has gone so    1.6065767145351917
far as to call this provision "the greatest achievement ever made in    1.6432600607208703
the course of human history".   The trend throughout the world's    1.5636360329510388
religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical    1.6065767145351917
validity of this constitutional enactment. Pakistan was created in    1.5127085093302464
1947 expressly as a Muslim state, but when the army took over eleven    1.67495327387791
years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed    1.7026049541338664
in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think    1.6432600607208703
their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political    1.6432600607208703
situation. "What is the point", Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis    1.5636360329510388
as asking, "in demanding an Islamic state and society if no    1.6065767145351917
one, not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves, can say clearly    1.67495327387791
and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is"?    1.6432600607208703
The current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly    1.5636360329510388
secular. And while the nation was formerly named "The Islamic    1.5636360329510388
Republic of Pakistan", it is now simply "The Republic of Pakistan".   1.6065767145351917
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere. The new regime    1.5127085093302464
in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor. The    1.5636360329510388
religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige    1.6065767145351917
in recent months. During the years when Israel was passing from    1.6065767145351917
crisis to crisis- the Sinai campaign, the infusion of multitudes of    1.6065767145351917
penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose of national unity    1.6065767145351917
could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious    1.7026049541338664
parties. Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction    1.5636360329510388
of tensions, the secularists are less disposed to compromise.    1.5127085093302464
And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between    1.6065767145351917
the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign    1.5636360329510388
served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the    1.6065767145351917
practical autonomy of both church and state. The failure at that time    1.6432600607208703
of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added    1.67495327387791
a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument.    1.5636360329510388
Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that    1.6432600607208703
governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible-    1.5636360329510388
in a word, too human- to warrant any claim of maintaining    1.6065767145351917
partnership with the divine. _2._ <Salvation reconsidered>. My    1.4513752902486308
father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded    1.6432600607208703
to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands    1.6065767145351917
and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese    1.6065767145351917
souls were going to hell each second because these students were not    1.6432600607208703
over there saving them. That mention of this should bring smiles to    1.6432600607208703
our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent    1.7269387314284994
to which attitudes have changed. I do not mean to imply that Christians    1.67495327387791
have adopted the liberal assumption, so prevalent in Hinduism,    1.5127085093302464
that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit. Leslie    1.6432600607208703
Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council    1.5127085093302464
of Churches when he says, "We must claim absoluteness and finality    1.6065767145351917
for Christ and His finished work, but that very claim forbids    1.6065767145351917
us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it".    1.6065767145351917
Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable    1.5127085093302464
significance. The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of    1.5127085093302464
its priests, Father Feeney, for insisting that there is no salvation    1.6065767145351917
outside the visible church. In mentioning this under "salvation    1.5127085093302464
reconsidered" I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine    1.6065767145351917
has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the    1.7026049541338664
world community what that doctrine is.    1.2818970554302986
When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to "permit"    1.7026049541338664
the termination of the human race by human action, because    1.5636360329510388
there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify    1.6065767145351917
such a thing, they know exactly what they mean. Of course, in prudential    1.67495327387791
calculation, in balancing the good directly intended and done against    1.5636360329510388
the evil unintended and indirectly done, no greater precision can    1.5636360329510388
be forthcoming than the subject allows. Yet it seems clear that there    1.6432600607208703
can be no good sufficiently great, or evil repelled sufficiently grave,    1.6065767145351917
to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action.   1.5636360329510388
I mean, however, that the moral theologian knows what he means by "permit".    1.67495327387791
He is not talking in the main about probabilities, risks    1.5636360329510388
and danger in general. He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously    1.7026049541338664
does an evil thing (and is known certainly and unavoidably    1.5636360329510388
to lead to this evil result) as it efficaciously does some good. He    1.67495327387791
is talking about double <effects,> of which the specific action causes    1.6065767145351917
directly the one and indirectly the other, but <causes> both;    1.5636360329510388
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended    1.67495327387791
or not directly intended, but still both are <done,> while the    1.6065767145351917
evil effect is, with equal consciousness on the part of the agent, foreknown    1.67495327387791
to be among the consequences. This is what, in a technical sense,    1.6432600607208703
to "only permit" an evil result means. It means to <do it>    1.6432600607208703
and to know one is doing it, but as only a secondary if certain effect    1.7269387314284994
of the good one primarily does and intends. Of course, grave guiltiness    1.6432600607208703
may be imputed to the military action of any nation, or to the action    1.7026049541338664
of any leader or leaders, which for any supposed good "permits",    1.6065767145351917
in <this> sense, the termination of the human race by human action.    1.6432600607208703
Certainly, in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives,    1.5636360329510388
"it is <never> possible that no world would be preferable to    1.6065767145351917
some worlds, and there are in truth <no> circumstances in which the    1.6432600607208703
destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative".   1.5636360329510388
Naturally, where one or the other of the effects of an action    1.6432600607208703
is uncertain, this has to be taken into account. Especially is this    1.6432600607208703
true when, because the good effect is remote and speculative while    1.6065767145351917
the evil is certain and grave, the action is prohibited. Presumably,    1.6065767145351917
if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the    1.7269387314284994
evil result that may be forthcoming, not only must the good and the    1.67495327387791
evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate, but also calculation    1.5636360329510388
of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty    1.6065767145351917
in the good or evil effect must be taken into account. There must    1.67495327387791
not only be greater good than evil objectively in view, but also greater    1.67495327387791
probability of actually doing more good than harm. If an evil which    1.6432600607208703
is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for    1.6065767145351917
by a problematic, speculative, future good, by the same token not every    1.6432600607208703
present, certain, and immediate good (or lesser evil) that may have    1.6065767145351917
to be done will be outweighed by a problematic, speculative, and future    1.6432600607208703
evil. Nevertheless, according to the traditional theory, a man begins    1.5636360329510388
in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences    1.67495327387791
before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.    1.5636360329510388
He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences    1.7026049541338664
of his action. Above all, he does not debate mere contingencies,    1.6065767145351917
and therefore, if these are possibly dreadful, find himself forced    1.5636360329510388
into inaction. He does what he can and may and must, without regarding    1.67495327387791
himself as lord of the future or, on the other hand, as covered with    1.7026049541338664
guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not    1.6432600607208703
"permit" in the sense explained. By contrast, a good deal of nuclear    1.6432600607208703
pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities, and    1.5127085093302464
not with the moral nature of the action to be done; and by deriving    1.7026049541338664
legitimate decision backward from whatever may <conceivably> or possibly    1.5127085093302464
or probably result, whether by anyone's doing or by accident,    1.5636360329510388
it finds itself driven to inaction, to non-political action in politics    1.6065767145351917
and non-military action in military affairs, and to the not very surprising    1.6432600607208703
discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense    1.6065767145351917
of justice can possibly be based.   Mr& Philip Toynbee    1.5127085093302464
writes, for example, that "in terms of probability it is surely <as    1.6432600607208703
likely as not> that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near    1.7026049541338664
future <if the present situation continues>. If it continues indefinitely    1.5636360329510388
it is <nearly a statistical certainty> that a mistake will    1.5636360329510388
be made and that the devastation will begin". Against such a termination    1.6432600607208703
of human life on earth by human action, he then proposes as an    1.67495327387791
alternative that we "negotiate at once with the Russians and get the    1.6432600607208703
best terms which are available", that we deliberately "negotiate    1.5127085093302464
from comparative weakness". He bravely attempts to face this alternative    1.5636360329510388
realistically, i&e&, by considering the worst possible outcome,    1.4513752902486308
namely, the total domination of the world by Russia within a few    1.6432600607208703
years. This would be by far the better choice, when "it is a question    1.7026049541338664
of <allowing> the human race to survive, possibly under the domination    1.6065767145351917
of a regime which most of us detest, or of <allowing> it to    1.67495327387791
destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish". Nevertheless, the    1.5127085093302464
consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified:    1.5127085093302464
it is "a possible result, however improbable"; "the worst, and    1.5636360329510388
least probable" result; "if it didn't prevail <mankind> would    1.5127085093302464
still be given the opportunity of prevailing"; for "surely    1.5127085093302464
anything is better than a policy which allows for the <possibility>    1.6065767145351917
of nuclear war". If we have not thought and made a decision entirely    1.67495327387791
in these terms, then we need to submit ourselves to the following    1.6432600607208703
"simple test": "Have we decided how we are to kill the other    1.6432600607208703
members of our household in the event of our being less injured than    1.67495327387791
they are"? Thus, moral decision must be entirely deduced backward    1.5636360329510388
from the likely eventuality; it is no longer to be formulated in terms    1.67495327387791
of the nature of present action itself, its intention, and proximate    1.6065767145351917
effect or the thing to be <done>.   Several of the replies    1.6065767145351917
to Mr& Toynbee, without conscious resort to the traditional terminology    1.5636360329510388
with regard to the permission of evil, succeed in restoring the    1.6065767145351917
actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be    1.6065767145351917
made, by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in    1.6065767145351917
danger of this evil. "It is worse for a nation to give in to evil    1.7269387314284994
**h than to run the risk of annihilation". "I am consciously prepared    1.6432600607208703
to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident' rather    1.6065767145351917
than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design. But    1.6065767145351917
I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need    1.67495327387791
not increase, but may be deliberately reduced" [by precautions against    1.5636360329510388
accidents or by limiting war?] "Quoting Mr& Kennan's    1.4513752902486308
phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably    1.6432600607208703
to nuclear war, he [Toynbee] says that anything is better than a    1.6432600607208703
policy which allows for the <possibility> of nuclear war". "If    1.5636360329510388
asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility,    1.6432600607208703
most men will choose the latter". "If **h Philip Toynbee    1.5636360329510388
is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the <risk>    1.6065767145351917
of nuclear war, I think he is right. I do not accept that the choice    1.7269387314284994
is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war". Even    1.5636360329510388
Professor Arnold Toynbee, agreeing with his son, does so in these    1.6065767145351917
terms: "Compared to continuing to incur a constant <risk> of    1.5636360329510388
the destruction of the human race, all other evils are lesser evils **h.    1.67495327387791
Let us therefore put first things first, and make sure of preserving    1.6432600607208703
the human race at whatever the temporary price may be".   Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that <if> he shared the    1.6065767145351917
anticipations of Orwell in <Nineteen Eighty-Four, if> he believed    1.5127085093302464
Communism was not only evil but "also <irredeemably> evil", then    1.5636360329510388
he might "think it right to do anything rather than to take the    1.67495327387791
risk of a communist world. Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less    1.67495327387791
frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the    1.6065767145351917
earth until doomsday". No political order or economic system is    1.5636360329510388
so clearly contrary to nature. But one does not have to affirm the existence    1.7026049541338664
of an evil order irredeemable in that sense, or a static order    1.6432600607208703
in which no changes will take place in time, to be able truthfully to    1.7026049541338664
affirm the following fact: there has never been <justitia> imprinted    1.5636360329510388
in social institutions and social relationships except in the context    1.5636360329510388
of some <pax-ordo> preserved by clothed or naked force. On their    1.6065767145351917
way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the <pax-ordo>    1.7026049541338664
of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility    1.5636360329510388
for its preservation. Not to repel injury and uphold and improve    1.6065767145351917
<pax-ordo> means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice    1.6065767145351917
that challenges it at the moment, but also to start down the steep    1.67495327387791
slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand. Toynbee    1.6432600607208703
seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social    1.67495327387791
embodiment. "I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of    1.6065767145351917
this country- by some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly    1.6065767145351917
by atomisation". Would such an act of refusal be useful? He does    1.6432600607208703
not mean, in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the    1.6065767145351917
proposition, that "if we took the risk of surrendering, a new generation    1.6432600607208703
in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order    1.67495327387791
to reverse the consequences of that surrender". He wants to be    1.6065767145351917
"brutally frank and say that these rebellions <would> be hopeless-    1.5636360329510388
far, far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956".    1.6065767145351917
This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war, by    1.67495327387791
creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited    1.6432600607208703
weapons. It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other    1.67495327387791
than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it, or preconditioned    1.6432600607208703
more positive means for attaining it, in the past. "It is    1.6065767145351917
no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso    1.6065767145351917
that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance    1.5636360329510388
by occupied peoples. Hope for the future **h would lie in the    1.6432600607208703
natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop".    1.67495327387791
This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted,    1.67495327387791
to the very last; it is to stride along the steep slope downward.    1.67495327387791
The only contrary action, in the future as in the past, runs the    1.67495327387791
<risk> of war; and, now and in the future unlike in the past, any    1.7026049541338664
attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment    1.6065767145351917
of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear    1.6065767145351917
warfare and the danger that an effect of it will, by human action, render    1.7026049541338664
this planet less habitable by the human race. That is why it is    1.67495327387791
so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision    1.6432600607208703
as to "permitted" effects, and not draw back in fright from    1.6065767145351917
any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities    1.5636360329510388
or probabilities unrelated, or not directly morally related,    1.4513752902486308
to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.   1.7269387314284994
Finally, just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful    1.5636360329510388
analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end    1.67495327387791
of human life on this earth, but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination,    1.7026049541338664
the same thing must be said in connection with the question    1.6065767145351917
of what we may perhaps already be doing, <by human action,> to accelerate    1.67495327387791
this end. We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought    1.67495327387791
about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle    1.6065767145351917
for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that    1.7026049541338664
in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence    1.67495327387791
among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know    1.6065767145351917
not what future.   1.0
MUCH MORE than shelter, housing symbolizes social status,    1.4513752902486308
a sense of "belonging", acceptance within a given group or neighborhood,    1.6065767145351917
identification with particular cultural values and social institutions,    1.4513752902486308
feelings of pride and worth, aspirations and hopes basic to    1.5636360329510388
human well-being. For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination    1.5636360329510388
in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow    1.5636360329510388
upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans.   1.5127085093302464
Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure    1.6065767145351917
to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders.    1.6065767145351917
This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying    1.5127085093302464
their professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for the human    1.6065767145351917
aspirations of racial minority groups in this country. It is not surprising    1.6432600607208703
that, as spokesman for real estate interests, the National Association    1.5636360329510388
of Real Estate Boards (~NAREB) and its local associations    1.5127085093302464
have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure.   1.6065767145351917
How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing    1.6432600607208703
restrictions based on race, religion or ethnic attachment? What    1.5127085093302464
does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest? What    1.7026049541338664
ought to be, what is his potential role as a force for constructive social    1.7026049541338664
change? What social, ethical and theological insights can the    1.5127085093302464
church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation?   1.6065767145351917
Recently, a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public    1.5636360329510388
Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions. Several    1.5127085093302464
New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium    1.6065767145351917
of property lawyers, political scientists, economists, social psychologists,    1.4513752902486308
social ethicists and theologians. Here, in an atmosphere    1.4513752902486308
of forthrightness and mutual criticism, each sought to bring his particular    1.6065767145351917
insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing    1.5636360329510388
and the part each man present played in it.   For a number of years,    1.7026049541338664
Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business    1.5636360329510388
leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty    1.5636360329510388
and student body, attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their    1.6065767145351917
responsibility for public policy. This article presents our observations    1.5127085093302464
of that session, of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the    1.67495327387791
faculty and students saw them.   Such conversation quickly reveals    1.5127085093302464
an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most    1.5636360329510388
realtors. Within the membership of this group, as has been found true    1.6432600607208703
of men in other professional or trade associations, the most ready    1.6065767145351917
portrayal of oneself to "the public" is that of a neutral agent simply    1.67495327387791
serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between    1.6065767145351917
them. Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving    1.5636360329510388
the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner. But as    1.67495327387791
conversation goes on, particularly among the realtors themselves, another    1.5127085093302464
image emerges, that of considerable power and influence in the community.    1.6065767145351917
Obviously, much more than customer expectation is determining    1.4513752902486308
the realtor's role. Judgments are continually rendered regarding    1.4513752902486308
the potential buyers' income, educational level and above all, racial    1.5636360329510388
extraction; and whether these would qualify them for "congenial",    1.5127085093302464
"happy" relations to other people in certain community areas.    1.5127085093302464
How explicit such factors have been    1.2818970554302986
historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases    1.5636360329510388
or in a review of ~NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34 in    1.6432600607208703
the Code, adopted in 1924, states that "a Realtor should never be    1.6432600607208703
instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property    1.5636360329510388
or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individuals    1.6065767145351917
whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that    1.6065767145351917
neighborhood". Though the reference to race was stricken by the association    1.6065767145351917
in 1950, being an agent of such "detrimental" influences    1.5127085093302464
still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to    1.6065767145351917
avoid.   The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently    1.5127085093302464
expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed stigma they believed    1.6065767145351917
would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white,    1.5636360329510388
particularly Negro, peoples into all-white, restricted areas.    1.3761581156320553
They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real    1.6432600607208703
estate "professionals" but agitators for some kind of "cause"    1.5127085093302464
or "reform", and this was no longer to be a "pro".   Obviously    1.6432600607208703
what we are confronted with here is the identification of "professional"    1.6065767145351917
with narrow skills and specialization, the effective servicing    1.4513752902486308
of a client, rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper    1.6065767145351917
meaning and associations of one's work. These men- for the most    1.6065767145351917
part educated in our "best" New England colleges, well established    1.5636360329510388
financially and socially in the community- under kindly but insistent    1.5636360329510388
probing, reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data    1.6065767145351917
for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the    1.5636360329510388
people they claim to serve, or about the public responses that actually    1.6432600607208703
follow their occasional breach of a "client-service relationship".   1.4513752902486308
This narrow "professionalism" does not even fit the present    1.5127085093302464
realities of their situation, as the pressure of minorities and the    1.6065767145351917
power and respectability of the realtors increase. As our discussion    1.5636360329510388
continued, the inadequacy of the "client relationship" as an interpretation    1.5636360329510388
of their "way of operating" became evident. Realtors    1.4513752902486308
live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work, as    1.67495327387791
members of social and professional organizations, as citizens and civic    1.5636360329510388
leaders, as church laymen, as university alumni, as newspaper readers,    1.5636360329510388
etc&.    1.0
From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that    1.5636360329510388
shapes his moral understanding.   It seems to us that choices exercised    1.6065767145351917
by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas:    1.6065767145351917
(1) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social    1.6065767145351917
issue; (2) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political    1.6432600607208703
processes; and, most pervasively, (3) their interpretation of    1.4513752902486308
who is a "real pro", of what it means to be a professional man in    1.7269387314284994
a technical, fragmented society.   (1) Most of the realtors minimized    1.5636360329510388
their own understanding of and role in the racial issue, pleading    1.6065767145351917
that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society.    1.6065767145351917
There is some reality to this; the Commission on Race and Housing    1.6432600607208703
concluded that "there is no reason to believe that real estate    1.6065767145351917
men are either more or less racially prejudiced, on the whole, than any    1.67495327387791
other segment of the American population". But such a reaction obscures    1.6065767145351917
the powerful efforts made in the past by both ~NAREB and    1.6065767145351917
its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices.    1.6065767145351917
Also, it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment    1.6065767145351917
continually employed.   Like business and university groups generally,    1.4513752902486308
these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and    1.5636360329510388
psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions    1.5127085093302464
they make. Realtors, both generally and in this group, have invariably    1.6065767145351917
equated residential integration with a decline in property values,    1.5127085093302464
a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension.   Recent    1.3761581156320553
studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others, however,    1.6065767145351917
point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion.    1.7026049541338664
There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated    1.5127085093302464
residentially without great loss of property values, the white population    1.5636360329510388
having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation    1.6065767145351917
of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing, privacy, etc&.    1.5127085093302464
Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial    1.7026049541338664
group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property    1.7026049541338664
values before the group comes in. Often they are able to get in    1.67495327387791
only because the area is declining economically.   Significantly,    1.4513752902486308
no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of    1.67495327387791
the six volumes (published by the University of California Press)    1.5636360329510388
that present the commission's findings. No one anticipates any radical    1.5636360329510388
shift in this situation, but questions concerning reading habits,    1.5127085093302464
the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must    1.67495327387791
surely be raised. The role of both church and university as sources    1.6432600607208703
of information and settings within which the implications of such information    1.6065767145351917
may be explored needs consideration.   Relevant "facts",    1.3761581156320553
however,    1.0
extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance    1.4513752902486308
of "harmonious" neighborhoods. Discussion of minority housing necessarily    1.4513752902486308
involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic    1.5636360329510388
conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity,    1.4513752902486308
the function and limitations of government in the securing of such    1.6065767145351917
equality, and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents    1.6065767145351917
(2) Realtors realize, of course, that they are involved in an    1.6065767145351917
increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities    1.6065767145351917
for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities    1.6065767145351917
for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination    1.4513752902486308
in housing. On the positive side, recent Federal action has largely    1.6065767145351917
undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position;    1.6065767145351917
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted    1.4513752902486308
by thirteen states and, while specific provisions have varied, the    1.5636360329510388
tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.   Realtors in attendance    1.5127085093302464
at the colloquium expressed interest, for example, in Connecticut's    1.5127085093302464
new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would    1.6065767145351917
like "to have to obey", but in support of which none had been willing    1.7026049541338664
to go on public record. As far as they were aware, the Connecticut    1.67495327387791
Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed    1.5127085093302464
the bill's passage or lobbied in its support. (This has not been the    1.67495327387791
case everywhere. In 1957, the Real Estate Boards of New York City    1.6432600607208703
actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination    1.4513752902486308
law. Official reasoning: the bill was a "wanton invasion    1.5127085093302464
of basic property rights".)   There are sins of omission as    1.5636360329510388
well as commission; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations,    1.6065767145351917
either negative or positive, plays a large part in the public    1.6065767145351917
acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively    1.67495327387791
enforced. Judicial opinion since the Supreme Court decision    1.4513752902486308
on <Shelley v& Kraemer> (1948) has rendered racial restrictive    1.5127085093302464
covenants unenforcible. Such a decision should have placed a powerful    1.5636360329510388
weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry, but there is little    1.67495327387791
evidence that realtors, or at least their associations, have repudiated    1.5636360329510388
the principle in such clauses.   In the states that have passed    1.6065767145351917
laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing,    1.5636360329510388
support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage    1.5636360329510388
through additional legislation could help remove the label of "social    1.5636360329510388
reformism" that most realtors individually seem determined to    1.4513752902486308
avoid. But as yet, no real estate board has been willing officially    1.6432600607208703
to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority    1.6432600607208703
buyers into all-white neighborhoods.   One of the roles of    1.5127085093302464
the social scientist, ethicist or theologian in our discussions with    1.5636360329510388
the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities    1.6065767145351917
offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise    1.5636360329510388
of broad social responsibilities in their work. But responsiveness to    1.5636360329510388
these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human    1.67495327387791
good and not simply as a professional, white, American good. Such    1.6065767145351917
judgments are meaningful only    1.0
in so far as persons are members of a world,    1.5636360329510388
let us say a community, that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers, but is    1.6432600607208703
also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.   That community    1.5127085093302464
of all creation is, then, the ultimate object of our loyalty and    1.6432600607208703
the concrete norm of all moral judgment. Racial discrimination is wrong,    1.6065767145351917
then, not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying    1.67495327387791
to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the    1.6432600607208703
grain of creation and against the will of the Creator. Thus, moral issues    1.67495327387791
concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take    1.5636360329510388
on theological dimensions.    1.0
(3) Over the years,    1.0
individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable    1.6065767145351917
unity in the methods and practices employed. Most realtors and    1.5636360329510388
real estate brokers talk of themselves as "professional people"    1.5127085093302464
with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions.    1.6065767145351917
But what significance attaches to "professional", beyond the narrow    1.5127085093302464
sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already    1.6065767145351917
noted? Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than    1.5636360329510388
any other.   As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional    1.6432600607208703
was, before the modern period of technical specialization, one who    1.5636360329510388
"professed" to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use    1.67495327387791
of his particular skills.   1.0
If we look about the world today, we can see clearly that there    1.67495327387791
are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization:    1.6065767145351917
<science> and <religion>. Science is placing in our    1.4513752902486308
hands the ultimate power of the universe, the power of the atom. Religion,    1.67495327387791
or the lack of it, will decide whether we use this power to build    1.7026049541338664
a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind, or whether    1.67495327387791
we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed. How can we    1.67495327387791
have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge?   We    1.6432600607208703
may feel pessimistic at the outlook. And yet there is a note of    1.67495327387791
hope,    1.0
because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is    1.7026049541338664
also giving us atomic vision. We are looking inside the atom and seeing    1.67495327387791
there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material,    1.6432600607208703
a universe that in a word is not matter but music. And it is    1.7026049541338664
in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration    1.7269387314284994
of our faith.    1.0
To see this vision in perspective,    1.2818970554302986
we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new    1.7026049541338664
power from the atom. You know that I could hold right here in my    1.7026049541338664
hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb    1.7026049541338664
that dropped on Hiroshima. It was only about the size of a baseball;    1.67495327387791
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of    1.6432600607208703
20,000 tons of ~TNT. That is enough ~TNT to fill the tower    1.6432600607208703
of the Empire State Building; and with the availability of bombs    1.6065767145351917
of that size, war became a new problem.   Now we might have restricted    1.67495327387791
the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium    1.6065767145351917
because it is found in only a few places in the world. But we had hardly    1.748515906000203
started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we    1.6432600607208703
were faced with the hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen is just as plentiful as    1.6432600607208703
uranium is scarce. We know that we have hydrogen in water; water is    1.67495327387791
**f and the ~H stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen in wood    1.67495327387791
and hydrogen in our bodies. I have calculated that if I could snap    1.67495327387791
my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen    1.7026049541338664
in my body, I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of    1.7026049541338664
the kind that fell on Hiroshima. I won't try the experiment, but    1.6432600607208703
I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let    1.7677783654484436
ourselves go, there would be quite an explosion. And then think how    1.6432600607208703
little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware    1.6432600607208703
Bay or in the ocean beyond. Salt water is still **f, the same hydrogen    1.7026049541338664
is there. And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the    1.7026049541338664
destructive power we hold in our hands today.   Of course, there    1.6065767145351917
is also an optimistic side to the picture. For if I knew the secret    1.7026049541338664
of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity,    1.6065767145351917
I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power    1.7026049541338664
in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories    1.7026049541338664
in the entire United States for some days. And think, if we all knew    1.7026049541338664
this secret and we could pool our power, what a wonderful public utility    1.67495327387791
company we would make. With just the hydrogen of our bodies, we    1.6432600607208703
could run the world for years. Then think of Delaware Bay and the    1.67495327387791
ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years    1.7269387314284994
to come. It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world,    1.67495327387791
provide adequate housing, food, education, abundant living for everyone    1.5127085093302464
everywhere.    1.0
Now let us see where this power    1.3761581156320553
comes from. To grasp our new view of the atom, we have to appreciate    1.7026049541338664
first of all how small the atom is. I have been trying to make this    1.7269387314284994
clear to my own class in chemistry. One night there were some dried    1.67495327387791
peas lying on our kitchen table, and these peas looked to me like a little    1.7269387314284994
group of atoms; and I asked myself a question: Suppose I    1.6065767145351917
had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body, how large an    1.748515906000203
area would they cover?   I calculated first that there are    1.5636360329510388
about an octillion atoms in the average human body; that is a figure    1.67495327387791
one with 27 ciphers, quite a large number. Then I calculated that a    1.67495327387791
million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator; a billion    1.6065767145351917
peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic; a trillion peas    1.67495327387791
would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people;    1.67495327387791
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia.   1.7026049541338664
I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at    1.6065767145351917
this rate, so I decided to take another measure- the whole state of    1.67495327387791
Pennsylvania. Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania,    1.5127085093302464
but instead of snowing snow, it snows peas; so we get the whole state    1.7026049541338664
covered with peas, about four feet deep. You can imagine what it would    1.67495327387791
look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against    1.67495327387791
the houses and covering the cars; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would    1.5636360329510388
contain about a quintillion peas.   But we still have a long    1.6065767145351917
way to go. Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas    1.7026049541338664
of the entire globe- North America, South America, Europe, Asia,    1.5636360329510388
and Africa, all covered with peas four feet deep; then we have    1.6432600607208703
sextillion peas. Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole    1.6432600607208703
earth with peas, then we go out among the neighboring stars, collect    1.6432600607208703
250 planets each the size of the earth, and also cover each of these    1.7026049541338664
with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion. Finally we    1.6432600607208703
go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way; we get 250,000 planets;    1.67495327387791
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last    1.7026049541338664
we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.    1.67495327387791
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are.    1.67495327387791
Now although an atom is small, we can still in    1.5636360329510388
imagination have a look at it. Let us focus on an atom of calcium from    1.7269387314284994
the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow    1.7269387314284994
a magic <Alice in Wonderland> growing pill. I start growing rapidly    1.6065767145351917
and this calcium atom grows along with me. I shoot up through the    1.67495327387791
roof, into the sky, past the clouds, through the stratosphere, out beyond    1.6432600607208703
the moon, out among the planets, until I am over a hundred and    1.67495327387791
fifty million miles long. Then this atom of calcium will swell to something    1.67495327387791
like a great balloon a hundred yards across, a balloon big enough    1.6432600607208703
to put a football field inside. And if you should step inside of such    1.7026049541338664
a magnified atom, according to the physics of forty years ago, you    1.6432600607208703
would see circulating over your head, down at the sides, and under your    1.67495327387791
feet, some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs. These    1.6065767145351917
balls are moving in great circles and ellipses, and are of course, the    1.67495327387791
electrons, the particles of negative electricity which by their action    1.5636360329510388
create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring    1.6432600607208703
atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone.   1.67495327387791
Since these electrons are moving like planets, you may wonder whether    1.6065767145351917
there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom. So you look down    1.7269387314284994
there and you see a tiny, whirling point about the size of the head    1.7026049541338664
of a pin. This is the atomic sun, the atomic nucleus. Even if the    1.7026049541338664
atom were big enough to hold a football field, this nucleus is still    1.67495327387791
only about the size of a pinhead. It is this atomic nucleus that contains    1.7026049541338664
the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged    1.5127085093302464
electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly all the mass,    1.6065767145351917
and the atomic energy.   You may ask what else there is, and the    1.67495327387791
answer is nothing- nothing but empty space. And since you are made    1.6432600607208703
of atoms, you are nothing much but empty space, too. If I could put    1.7026049541338664
your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down, squeeze    1.6432600607208703
these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge,    1.748515906000203
you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole    1.6432600607208703
was gone, you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you    1.7026049541338664
could see on this piece of paper. Someone has remarked that this is    1.67495327387791
certainly the ultimate in reducing. At any rate, it shows us how immaterial    1.67495327387791
we are.    1.0
Now this 1920 view of the    1.2818970554302986
atom was on the whole a discouraging picture. For we believed that the    1.67495327387791
electrons    1.0
obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore    1.5127085093302464
the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics the    1.6432600607208703
whole is no more than the sum of the parts. So if you are made of    1.748515906000203
atoms, you are just a big machine; and since the universe is also made    1.7026049541338664
of atoms, it is just a supermachine. And this would mean that we    1.67495327387791
live in a mechanistic universe, governed by the laws of cause and effect,    1.67495327387791
bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely    1.6432600607208703
predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit    1.6432600607208703
or human freedom. And this is why so many scientists a half a century    1.7026049541338664
ago were agnostics or atheists.   Then came the scientific revolution    1.5636360329510388
in the late 1920's. A suggestion from Louis de Broglie, a    1.6065767145351917
physicist in France, showed us that these electrons are not point particles    1.6432600607208703
but waves. And to see the meaning of this new picture, imagine    1.6432600607208703
that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom    1.7026049541338664
and have a look at it in the way we view it today. Now as you step    1.7677783654484436
inside, instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets, you    1.5636360329510388
see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface    1.7269387314284994
of a pond when you drop a stone into it. These ripples spread    1.67495327387791
out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral.    1.6432600607208703
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from    1.7026049541338664
the neighboring atoms, you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear    1.7026049541338664
music. It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra    1.748515906000203
playing a symphony. Harmony, melody, counterpoint symphonic structure    1.4513752902486308
are there; and as this music ebbs and flows, there is an antiphonal    1.67495327387791
chorus from all the atoms outside, in fact from the atoms of    1.6432600607208703
the entire universe. And so today when we examine the structure of our    1.67495327387791
knowledge of the atom and of the universe, we are forced to conclude    1.67495327387791
that the best word to describe our universe is <music>.   1.5636360329510388
The Island of Nantucket, part of the State of Massachusetts,    1.5636360329510388
lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State. Some of    1.6065767145351917
the Island is sand and is not suitable for living. The Island folk    1.67495327387791
have their living almost entirely from summer visitors; the rest is    1.6065767145351917
obtained from harbor scallops. During about three and a half months    1.6065767145351917
of the year, in the summer, there are three boats that run from the mainland    1.7269387314284994
to the Island carrying passengers, food, and cars; but the    1.5636360329510388
rest of the year only one boat is needed, which ties up at the mainland    1.7269387314284994
nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime. This    1.6432600607208703
is a fine trip, too, on a good day. With Martha's Vineyard on one    1.7026049541338664
side and the open sea on the other, it makes an excellent trip of about    1.7269387314284994
three hours.   1.0
TO WHAT extent and in what ways did Christianity affect    1.5636360329510388
the United States of America in the nineteenth century? How far    1.6065767145351917
and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging    1.67495327387791
in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age? To what    1.6432600607208703
extent did it mould the morals and the social, economic, and political    1.6432600607208703
life and institutions of the country?   A complete picture is    1.5636360329510388
impossible- partly because of the limitations of space, partly because    1.5636360329510388
for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian    1.5636360329510388
faith data are unobtainable. Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty    1.6432600607208703
of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors.   1.5127085093302464
Although a complete picture cannot be given, we can indicate    1.5636360329510388
some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at    1.6432600607208703
least one creative factor. At times we can say that it was the major    1.7026049541338664
factor.   What in some ways was the most important aspect was the    1.6432600607208703
impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation. As    1.5636360329510388
we have seen, a growing proportion, although in 1914 still a minority,    1.6432600607208703
were members of churches. Presumably those who did not have a formal    1.6432600607208703
church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater    1.6432600607208703
or less extent. Many of them had once been members of a church    1.67495327387791
or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or    1.67495327387791
another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse. The form of Christianity    1.6432600607208703
to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of    1.6065767145351917
the older stock, for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century    1.5636360329510388
immigration; for still others, mostly of the nineteenth-century    1.4513752902486308
immigration, it was Roman Catholicism, and for a small minority it was    1.6432600607208703
Eastern Orthodoxy. Upon all of them played the intellectual, social,    1.5636360329510388
political, and economic attitudes, institutions, and customs of the    1.5127085093302464
nation. Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through    1.6432600607208703
them had had a share in making the individual what he was. Yet    1.67495327387791
to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual    1.67495327387791
showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible. At    1.5127085093302464
best only an approximation could be arrived at. To generalize for the    1.6432600607208703
entire nation would be absurd. For instance, we cannot know whether    1.6065767145351917
even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards    1.6065767145351917
of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members    1.6065767145351917
in the population rose. The temptation is to say that, as the percentage    1.67495327387791
of church members mounted, the degree of discipline exercised    1.5127085093302464
by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general    1.67495327387791
level. Yet this cannot be proved. We know that in the early part    1.67495327387791
of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action    1.5127085093302464
against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority    1.6065767145351917
subscribed. Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance    1.5127085093302464
of charges against their members of drunkenness, fighting, malicious    1.5127085093302464
gossip, lying, cheating, sexual irregularities, gambling, horse racing,    1.4513752902486308
and failure to pay just debts. If guilty, the offender might be excluded    1.67495327387791
from membership. As church membership burgeoned, such measures    1.4513752902486308
faded into desuetude. But whether this was accompanied by a general    1.6065767145351917
lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know.   What    1.67495327387791
we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point    1.6432600607208703
out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects    1.5636360329510388
of the life of the nation. We have already hinted at the fashion in    1.7026049541338664
which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life.    1.5636360329510388
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals    1.7026049541338664
of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain    1.7026049541338664
those ideals through reform movements, through programmes for bringing    1.5127085093302464
the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards,    1.6065767145351917
and through leaders in the government.   Throughout the    1.4513752902486308
nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American    1.4513752902486308
society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock.    1.6432600607208703
By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning    1.6432600607208703
to make itself felt, mainly through such institutions as hospitals    1.5636360329510388
but also through its attitude towards organized labour. In the twentieth    1.6065767145351917
century its influence grew, as did that of the Protestantism of    1.6065767145351917
the nineteenth-century immigration.    1.0
The ideals    1.0
of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the    1.6065767145351917
older stock. Thus "America", the most widely sung of the patriotic    1.6065767145351917
songs, was written by a New England Baptist clergyman, Samuel Francis    1.6065767145351917
Smith (1808-1895), while a student in Andover Theological    1.4513752902486308
Seminary. With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it    1.6432600607208703
breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals.    1.6065767145351917
The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by    1.6065767145351917
the Christian faith. Here was what was called the American dream, namely,    1.6432600607208703
the effort to build a structure which would be something new in    1.6432600607208703
history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it. Later    1.7026049541338664
in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine    1.67495327387791
Lee Bates (1859-1929), daughter and granddaughter of New England    1.5127085093302464
Congregational ministers, in her widely sung hymn, written in    1.5127085093302464
1893, "America the Beautiful", with the words "O beautiful    1.5127085093302464
for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom    1.6065767145351917
beat across the wilderness. America, America, God mend    1.4513752902486308
thy every flaw, confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law    1.67495327387791
**h. O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine    1.6432600607208703
alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears. America, America,    1.5127085093302464
God shed His grace on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood from    1.67495327387791
sea to shining sea".   The American dream was compounded of    1.5636360329510388
many strains. Some were clearly of Christian origin, among them the    1.6065767145351917
Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian    1.5636360329510388
liberty, Christian equality, and Christian fraternity the passion of    1.5127085093302464
the land. Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection    1.6432600607208703
as the fountain-head of the American hope. Here, too, must    1.5636360329510388
be placed Unitarianism and, less obviously from Christian inspiration,    1.5127085093302464
Emerson, Transcendentalism, and the idealism of Walt Whitman. We    1.5127085093302464
must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of    1.67495327387791
myth- among them Melville, Hawthorne, and Henry James the elder,    1.5636360329510388
all of them out of a Christian background.    1.4513752902486308
With    1.0
such a dream arising, at least in part, from the Protestant heritage    1.6432600607208703
of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation,    1.6432600607208703
it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete    1.67495327387791
expression. A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or    1.6432600607208703
remove social ills.   Significantly, the initiation and leadership    1.4513752902486308
of a major proportion of the reform movements, especially those in    1.6065767145351917
the first half of the nineteenth century, came from men and women of    1.67495327387791
New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian    1.6065767145351917
Congregationalism. Several of the movements were given a marked    1.5127085093302464
impetus by revivalism. Quakers, some from New England, had a larger    1.6065767145351917
share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted.    1.5127085093302464
We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England    1.7026049541338664
ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter    1.5636360329510388
Day Saints, the Seventh Day Adventists, Christian Science, the    1.5127085093302464
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American    1.5127085093302464
Home Missionary Society, the American Bible Society, and New    1.5127085093302464
England theology. The atmosphere was one of optimism, of confidence    1.5636360329510388
in human progress, and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.    1.7026049541338664
The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence, although holding    1.3761581156320553
to original sin and the doctrine of election, inspired its adherents    1.6065767145351917
to heroic endeavours for others, looked for the early coming of the    1.6432600607208703
Millennium, and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability    1.5636360329510388
cherished by the Unitarians, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists.   1.4513752902486308
We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind    1.6432600607208703
which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles    1.5636360329510388
and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe- among them prison    1.6065767145351917
reform, anti-slavery measures, legislation for the alleviation of conditions    1.5127085093302464
of labour, the Inner Mission, and the Red Cross.   We    1.5636360329510388
cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation    1.7026049541338664
of collective ills. A few of the more prominent must serve    1.6065767145351917
as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose.    1.6065767145351917
Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the    1.6065767145351917
century. Others were ephemeral. Some disappeared with the attainment    1.5127085093302464
of their purpose. Still others sprang up late in the century to meet    1.67495327387791
conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age.    1.5636360329510388
The movement to end Negro slavery began    1.3761581156320553
before 1815 and mounted after that year until, as a result of the Civil    1.7026049541338664
War, emancipation was achieved.   Long before 1815 the Christian    1.5127085093302464
conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act    1.6065767145351917
accordingly. For example, in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting    1.5127085093302464
of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves    1.5636360329510388
and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not    1.67495327387791
comply. In the latter year Samuel Hopkins, from whom the Hopkinsian    1.6065767145351917
strain of New England theology took its name, asked the Continental    1.6065767145351917
Congress to abolish slavery. As we have seen, Methodism early took    1.6065767145351917
a stand against slavery. Beginning at least as far back as 1789 various    1.67495327387791
Baptist bodies condemned slavery.   After 1815 anti-slavery    1.3761581156320553
sentiment mounted, chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant    1.5127085093302464
background of the older stock. The nineteenth-century immigration,    1.4513752902486308
whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, was not so much concerned,    1.5636360329510388
for very few if any among them held slaves: they were mostly in the    1.7026049541338664
Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out,    1.6432600607208703
or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.   The anti-slavery movement    1.5636360329510388
took many forms. Benjamin Lundy (1789-1839), a Quaker, was    1.5127085093302464
a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies. It was    1.6065767145351917
he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879)    1.5636360329510388
to the subject. Garrison, Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage,    1.5636360329510388
was by temperament and conviction a reformer. Chiefly remembered    1.5127085093302464
because of his incessant advocacy of "immediate and unconditional    1.5127085093302464
abolition", he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among    1.6065767145351917
them women's rights, prohibition, and justice to the Indians. Incurably    1.5636360329510388
optimistic, dogmatic, and utterly fearless, in his youth a devout    1.5636360329510388
Baptist, in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John    1.6065767145351917
Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892) he eventually attacked the orthodox    1.4513752902486308
churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery    1.6065767145351917
issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox    1.5636360329510388
and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible.   A marked    1.5636360329510388
impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals.    1.5636360329510388
Finney himself, while opposed to slavery, placed his chief emphasis    1.5636360329510388
on evangelism, but from his converts issued much of the leadership of    1.6432600607208703
the anti-slavery campaign. Theodore Dwight Weld (1803-1895) was    1.4513752902486308
especially active. Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational    1.6432600607208703
ministers. As a youth he became one of Finney's band    1.5636360329510388
of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men. A strong temperance    1.6432600607208703
advocate, through the influence of a favorite teacher, Charles    1.5127085093302464
Stewart, another Finney convert, he devoted himself to the anti-slavery    1.5636360329510388
cause. A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological    1.67495327387791
Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery    1.5636360329510388
position. The majority then went to the infant Oberlin. They and    1.6065767145351917
others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win    1.6065767145351917
adherents to the cause. Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions    1.5636360329510388
of such men as Joshua R& Giddings and Edwin M& Stanton,    1.6065767145351917
enlisted John Quincy Adams, and helped provide ideas which underlay    1.5636360329510388
Harriet Beecher Stowe's <Uncle Tom's Cabin>. He shunned    1.4513752902486308
publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.   Wendell Phillips    1.5636360329510388
(1811-1884), from a prominent Massachusetts family, in his teens    1.5127085093302464
was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher. Although he    1.5636360329510388
later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently    1.6432600607208703
outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout Christian.    1.5127085093302464
He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition,    1.5636360329510388
but he also stood for equal rights for women, for opportunity for the    1.67495327387791
freedmen, and for prohibition.   The anti-slavery movement and    1.4513752902486308
other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership    1.4513752902486308
and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan (1786-1865) and his younger    1.5636360329510388
brother, Lewis Tappan (1788-1873).   1.0
Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power    1.4513752902486308
were transmuted at death into awesome spirits; they were almost immediately    1.6065767145351917
worshipped for these newer, even more terrible abilities. Their    1.5127085093302464
direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes, but also    1.5636360329510388
the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of    1.67495327387791
the universe. Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly    1.5636360329510388
achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power.   Thus,    1.3761581156320553
the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less    1.6432600607208703
puissant ancestors. But this eminence was not without its weighty    1.5636360329510388
responsibilities.    1.0
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe    1.5127085093302464
of living beings and dead spirits, the emperor had to use it for    1.67495327387791
the benefit of the living. The royal ritual generated power into the    1.6432600607208703
other world: it also provided the living with a way to control the    1.67495327387791
spirits, and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs    1.6432600607208703
of the world. Proper ritual observance at any level of society was    1.6432600607208703
capable of generating power for use in the spirit world; but naturally,    1.6432600607208703
the royal ritual, which provided unusual control over already supremely    1.5636360329510388
powerful divine spirits, was held responsible for regulating the    1.5127085093302464
universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.   This is the    1.6065767145351917
familiar system of "cosmic government". The Chinese emperor, by    1.5127085093302464
proper observance of ritual, manifested divine powers. He regulated    1.5127085093302464
the dualities of light and darkness, <Yang> and <Yin>, which are    1.6065767145351917
locked in eternal struggle. By swaying the balance between them, he    1.6065767145351917
effected the alternation of the seasons. His power was so great that    1.6432600607208703
he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given    1.6432600607208703
ear or been deaf to petitions.   In this system, no man is exempt    1.67495327387791
from obligations. Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's    1.6065767145351917
family, outrages to community propriety, any departure from rigid    1.5127085093302464
standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead. And to    1.6065767145351917
offend the dead meant to incur their wrath, and thus provoke the unleashing    1.67495327387791
of countrywide disasters. The family home was, in fact, a temple;    1.6065767145351917
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in    1.5636360329510388
nature. The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and    1.6432600607208703
in every fear.   The common belief was that there existed one    1.6065767145351917
moral order, which included everything. The dead controlled the material    1.5636360329510388
prosperity of the living, and the living adhered to strict codes of    1.6432600607208703
conduct in order not to weaken that control. Men believed they could    1.6432600607208703
control nature by obeying a moral code. If the moral code were flouted,    1.67495327387791
the proper balance of the universe would be upset, and the disastrous    1.6432600607208703
result could be floods, plague, or famine.   Modern Westerners    1.5127085093302464
have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material,    1.5127085093302464
largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the    1.67495327387791
connection. Living in urban conditions, away from the deadweight of    1.5636360329510388
village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view,    1.5636360329510388
the individual may find it possible, say, to commit adultery not only    1.6432600607208703
without personal misgivings, but also without suffering any adverse    1.5127085093302464
effects in his worldly fortunes. Basing action on the empirical determination    1.6065767145351917
of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no    1.6065767145351917
powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation    1.5636360329510388
from the constraint of silent burial urns.   In China,    1.5127085093302464
the magical system par excellence was Taoism. The Taoists were Quietist    1.6065767145351917
mystics, who saw an unchanging unity- the Tao- underlying    1.5127085093302464
all phenomena. It was this timeless unity that was all-important, and    1.6065767145351917
not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality. The Taoists    1.6065767145351917
believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation;    1.5636360329510388
in other words, they were actually an organization of magicians.   1.5636360329510388
Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical    1.5127085093302464
concepts. After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced    1.5636360329510388
into China, it underwent extensive changes. During its flowering in    1.5636360329510388
the sixth to the eighth centuries, Mahayana offered a supernatural package    1.6065767145351917
to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested    1.6065767145351917
philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader. Mahayana    1.5636360329510388
had gods, and magic, a pantheon, heavens and hells, and gorgeously    1.6065767145351917
appareled priests, monks, and nuns, all of whom wielded power over    1.6065767145351917
souls in the other world. The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed    1.5636360329510388
superhuman powers and magic. The Mahayana that developed in the    1.5636360329510388
north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic, that made the world    1.67495327387791
into a huge magical garden. In its monastic form, Mahayana was merely    1.6432600607208703
an organization of magic-practicing monks (<bonzes>), who catered    1.4513752902486308
to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.   Nonmagical Confucianism    1.5127085093302464
was a secular, rational philosophy, but even with this different    1.5636360329510388
orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government.    1.6432600607208703
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power.    1.6432600607208703
If a man lived a classical life, he need not fear the spirits- for    1.7026049541338664
only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him. But let us not be    1.7269387314284994
mistaken about Confucian "virtue"; this was not virtue as we    1.5636360329510388
understand the word today, and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief    1.7026049541338664
in magic manipulation. To the Confucian, "virtue" simply meant    1.5127085093302464
mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual    1.6065767145351917
and three thousand minor ones. Propriety was synonymous with ritual    1.5636360329510388
observance, the mark of a true gentleman. To live correctly in an    1.6432600607208703
interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive    1.6065767145351917
for man's fate.   This, in brief, was the historical background    1.5636360329510388
out of which Zen emerged. Promoters of Zen to the West record    1.6432600607208703
its ancestry, and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of    1.6432600607208703
Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism. But the "marvelous person"    1.5127085093302464
that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality    1.6065767145351917
than Indian speculation- he possesses magical powers, and can    1.5127085093302464
use them to order nature and to redeem souls. Proponents of Zen to    1.67495327387791
the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism    1.5127085093302464
in Zen, probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist    1.6065767145351917
ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic. But in the Chinese    1.5636360329510388
mind, there was little difference between the two- the <bonzes>    1.5636360329510388
were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be.   Actually,    1.6065767145351917
Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism.    1.6432600607208703
The Ch'an (Zen) sect may have derived its metaphysic from    1.5636360329510388
Mahayana, but its psychology was pure early Taoist. This is well    1.6065767145351917
evidenced    1.0
by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen: the idea of    1.6065767145351917
the inward turning of thought, the enjoinder to put aside desires and    1.6432600607208703
perturbations so that a return to purity, peace, and stillness- a    1.6065767145351917
union with the Infinite, with the Tao- could be effected. In fact,    1.6432600607208703
the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so    1.6065767145351917
uniquely characteristic of the "direct thinking" Zennist was a feature    1.5636360329510388
of Taoism. So, too, was the insistence on the relativity of the    1.6432600607208703
external world, and the ideas that language and things perceived by    1.6065767145351917
consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by    1.5127085093302464
pure, indwelling spirit: the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating    1.5636360329510388
consciousness.   Zen maintains that cognitive things    1.2818970554302986
are only the surface of experience. One of its features attractive    1.6065767145351917
to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred    1.67495327387791
texts. One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures    1.5636360329510388
for use in an outhouse. But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom    1.7026049541338664
of action for which the Westerner mistakes it. It is simply that    1.6432600607208703
in Taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms- books, words,    1.5636360329510388
or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness    1.6432600607208703
are considered only the surface of experience. The truth- the    1.5636360329510388
Eternal Truth- is not transmittable by words. Reality is considered    1.5636360329510388
not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge, but    1.5636360329510388
a positive handicap. The technique of reality confusion- the use of    1.6065767145351917
paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality- originated    1.6065767145351917
with fourth and third century B&C& Chinese Quietism: the    1.5127085093302464
<koan> is not basically a new device.   It is important for an    1.6432600607208703
understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of    1.5636360329510388
the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man. In the supernatural    1.7026049541338664
atmosphere of cosmic government, only the ruling elite was ever    1.5636360329510388
concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature: popular religion    1.5127085093302464
aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers. And this is only    1.6432600607208703
natural- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest    1.6065767145351917
"wonder drug". Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed    1.4513752902486308
at a mystic pantheist union with the divine, personal salvation being    1.6065767145351917
achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence. But    1.5636360329510388
this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers.    1.6432600607208703
The anchorite strove, in fact, to magically influence the world    1.5636360329510388
of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power.    1.67495327387791
Thus, the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was    1.5636360329510388
distilled down to a bare self-seeking, and for this reason, the mystic    1.6432600607208703
in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation. As the Zen    1.6432600607208703
literature reveals, as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in    1.6432600607208703
seclusion, he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.    1.6432600607208703
The early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed    1.5636360329510388
ability to perform miracles.   Exponents of Zen often insist    1.5127085093302464
that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism    1.5127085093302464
of China, and proposed instead a more mature, less credulous view of    1.6432600607208703
the universe. In support of this, stories from the early literature are    1.6432600607208703
cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power. But    1.6432600607208703
actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters    1.5636360329510388
were in fact supposed to possess, as well as the extreme degree of    1.67495327387791
popular credulity: "Hwang Pah (O baku), one day going up Mount    1.6065767145351917
Tien Tai **h which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats    1.6432600607208703
with supernatural powers, met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light.    1.6432600607208703
They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while    1.67495327387791
until they came to a river roaring with torrent. There being no bridge,    1.67495327387791
the master had to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed    1.6432600607208703
the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow    1.67495327387791
him. Thereupon Hwang Pah said: "If I knew thou art an Arhat,    1.6432600607208703
I would have doubled you up before thou got over there"! The monk    1.67495327387791
then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah, and praised    1.5636360329510388
him as a true Mahayanist. (1)"   A second tale shows still    1.6065767145351917
more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess:    1.6432600607208703
"On one occasion Yang Shan (Kyo-zan) saw a stranger monk flying    1.6065767145351917
through the air. When that monk came down and approached him with a    1.67495327387791
respectful salutation, he asked: "Where art thou from"? "Early    1.5127085093302464
this morning", replied the other, "I set out from India".    1.5636360329510388
"Why", said the teacher, "art thou so late"? "I stopped",    1.5636360329510388
responded the man, "several times to look at beautiful sceneries".    1.5636360329510388
"Thou mayst have supernatural powers", exclaimed Yang Shan,    1.4513752902486308
"yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me". Then    1.6432600607208703
the monk praised Yang Shan saying: "I have come over to China    1.6432600607208703
in order to worship Manjucri, and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya",    1.6065767145351917
and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India,    1.6432600607208703
went back through the air. (2)"   In the popular Chinese    1.5636360329510388
mind, Ch'an (Zen) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that    1.67495327387791
dominated.   A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical    1.5636360329510388
carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes. To the    1.6065767145351917
Zen monk the universe is still populated with "spiritual beings"    1.5636360329510388
who have to be appeased. Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists    1.7026049541338664
in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings". Modern Zen presentation    1.6065767145351917
to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian, highly pragmatic    1.5127085093302464
nature of the Zen belief- scriptures are burned to make fire,    1.6065767145351917
action is based on direct self-confidence, and so on. This picture    1.6065767145351917
of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such    1.5636360329510388
Zendo formulas as: "O you, demons and other spiritual beings,    1.5636360329510388
I now offer this to you, and may this food fill up the ten quarters    1.7269387314284994
of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith.    1.7026049541338664

Pope Leo /13,, on the 13th day of December 1898, granted    1.6065767145351917
the following indulgences: "An indulgence of three hundred days is    1.5636360329510388
granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a    1.67495327387791
quarter of an hour. A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions    1.6065767145351917
is granted once a month for the daily reading". Pope Pius the Sixth,    1.67495327387791
at Rome, in april, 1778, wrote the following: "The faithful    1.5636360329510388
should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures: For these    1.6432600607208703
are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone,    1.67495327387791
to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate    1.6432600607208703
errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times". The    1.6065767145351917
American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore    1.5636360329510388
urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible. "We hope",    1.6065767145351917
they said, "that no family can be found amongst us without a    1.6432600607208703
correct version of the Holy Scriptures". They recommended, also,    1.5127085093302464
that "at a fixed hour, let the entire family be assembled for night    1.67495327387791
prayers, followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures".   1.5636360329510388
Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred    1.5636360329510388
Scriptures be read, the following taken from the Holy Bible (New    1.6065767145351917
Catholic Edition) will prove a means of grace and a source of great    1.67495327387791
spiritual blessing.    1.0

I said to thee, "You must be born again". St& John 3:7.    1.6432600607208703
_THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE GOD IS HOLY._ But as the One    1.67495327387791
who called you is holy, be you also holy in all your behavior; for    1.7026049541338664
it is written, You shall be holy, because I am holy. /1, St& Peter    1.7026049541338664

Hebrews 12:14. _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE ALL HAVE SINNED._    1.6065767145351917
As it is written, There is not one just man; there is none    1.67495327387791
who understands; there is none who seeks after God. All have gone    1.6432600607208703
astray together; **h All have sinned and have need of the glory of    1.67495327387791
God. Romans 3:10-12, 23. _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE    1.6065767145351917
NATURAL MAN IS SPIRITUALLY DEAD AND BLIND._ Therefore as through    1.5636360329510388
one man sin entered into the world and through sin death, and thus death    1.7026049541338664
has passed unto all men because all have sinned. Romans 5:12.   1.6065767145351917
You also, when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins.    1.67495327387791
Ephesians 2:1.   And if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled    1.6432600607208703
only to those who are perishing. In their case, the god of this    1.67495327387791
world [Satan] has blinded their unbelieving minds, that they should    1.5636360329510388
not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image    1.748515906000203
of God. /2, Corinthians 4:3, 4.   For his workmanship    1.5127085093302464
we are, created in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:10. _THE NEW BIRTH    1.6065767145351917
IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD_ For you have been reborn,    1.6432600607208703
not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible, through the word of    1.6065767145351917
God. /1, St& Peter 1:23.   Of his own will he has begotten    1.6432600607208703

I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water [symbol of the    1.7269387314284994
Word of God, see Ephesians 5:26] and the Spirit, he cannot enter    1.6432600607208703

_IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE HAVE    1.4513752902486308
FAITH IN CHRIST AS THE ONLY SAVIOUR._ Everyone who believes that    1.6065767145351917
Jesus is the Christ is born of God. /1, St& John 5:1.   1.6432600607208703

Whoever is born of God does not commit sin [That is, he does not    1.7026049541338664
practice sin. Cf& /1, St& John 2:1]. /1, St& John 3:9.   1.6065767145351917
We know that no one who is born of God commits sin. /1,    1.67495327387791
St& John 5:18. [The new nature, received at the time of regeneration,    1.6432600607208703
is divine and holy, and as the believer lives under the power    1.6432600607208703
of this new nature he does not practice sin.] _IF WE ARE BORN OF    1.7026049541338664
GOD WE PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS._ If you know that he [God] is just    1.6432600607208703
[righteous], know that everyone also who does what is just [righteous]    1.6065767145351917
has been born of him. /1, St& John 2:29. _IF WE ARE    1.6432600607208703
BORN OF GOD WE LOVE GOD._ Everyone who loves is born of God, and    1.7026049541338664
knows God. /1, St& John 4:7. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE    1.7026049541338664

we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. /1,    1.67495327387791
St& John 3:14. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE OVERCOME THE WORLD._    1.67495327387791

that overcomes the world, our faith. /1, St& John 5:4.    1.5636360329510388

/2, St& Peter 3:18. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PERSEVERE UNTO    1.67495327387791
THE END._ I am convinced of this, that he who has begun a good work    1.7269387314284994
in you will bring it to perfection until the day of Christ Jesus.    1.67495327387791
Philippians 1:6.   Now to him who is able to preserve you without    1.6432600607208703

in gladness, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ    1.6065767145351917
our Lord, belong glory and majesty, dominion and authority, before    1.5636360329510388
all time, and now, and forever. St& Jude 24. _THE NEW BIRTH IS    1.67495327387791
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM REQUIRES A SPIRITUAL NATURE._    1.5127085093302464
Jesus answered and said to him [Nicodemus] "Amen, amen, I say    1.6065767145351917
to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God".    1.7269387314284994
**h "Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again    1.67495327387791

which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of    1.7026049541338664
the Spirit is spirit. Do not wonder that I said to thee, 'You must    1.7026049541338664
be born again'". St& John 3:3, 5-7.    1.3761581156320553
_THE NEW BIRTH IS A NEW CREATION._ For in Christ Jesus    1.6065767145351917
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of    1.5636360329510388
any account. Galatians 6:15.   If then any man is in Christ,    1.6065767145351917
he is a new creature [literally, "He is a new creation"], the    1.6432600607208703
former things have passed away; behold, they are made new! /2, Corinthians    1.6432600607208703
5:17.   For by grace you have been saved through faith;    1.5636360329510388
and that not from yourselves, for it is the gift of God; not    1.67495327387791
as the outcome of works, lest anyone may boast. For his workmanship    1.6432600607208703
we are, created in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:8-10. _THE NEW BIRTH    1.6065767145351917
IS THE IMPLANTATION OF A NEW LIFE._ I came that they may have life.    1.7026049541338664
St& John 10:10.   He who has the Son has the life. He    1.6432600607208703
who has not the Son has not the life. /1, St& John 5:12.   1.67495327387791
He who believes in the Son [Jesus Christ, the Son of God],    1.6432600607208703
has everlasting life. St& John 3:36. _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE    1.6065767145351917
IMPARTATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE._ Through which he has granted us    1.6065767145351917
the very great and precious promises, so that through them you may become    1.67495327387791
partaker of the divine nature. /2, St& Peter 1:4. _THE NEW    1.6065767145351917
BIRTH IS CHRIST LIVING IN YOU BY FAITH._ Christ in you, your hope    1.67495327387791
of glory. Colossians 1:27.   It is now no longer I that live,    1.6432600607208703
but Christ lives in me. And the life that I now live in the flesh,    1.7269387314284994
I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself    1.748515906000203
up for me. Galatians 2:20.   To have Christ dwelling through    1.5636360329510388
faith in your hearts. Ephesians 3:17. _THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS    1.6065767145351917
AND MYSTERIOUS._ The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest    1.6065767145351917
its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes.    1.7026049541338664
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit. St& John 3:8. _THE    1.67495327387791
NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS._ Amen, amen, I say to    1.6065767145351917
you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has life everlasting,    1.7269387314284994
and does not come to judgment, but has passed from death to    1.6432600607208703
life. St& John 5:24.    1.0
_THE NEW    1.0
BIRTH IS A WORK OF GOD._ But to as many as received him he gave the    1.748515906000203
power of becoming sons of God; to those who believe in his name:    1.67495327387791
Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the    1.748515906000203
will of man, but of God. St& John 1:12, 13.    1.5636360329510388
You may be very religious, a good church member, an upright, honest    1.6432600607208703
and sincere person; you may be baptized, confirmed, reverent and worshipful;    1.6065767145351917
you may attend mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously    1.5636360329510388
keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may have    1.6432600607208703
the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost    1.7269387314284994
and headed for hell and eternal punishment. You cannot be saved;    1.6065767145351917
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again. Our blessed Lord    1.67495327387791
Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of God, who could not lie, said,    1.6432600607208703
"Amen,    1.0
amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see    1.7026049541338664
the kingdom of God" (St& John 3:3). "You must be born again"    1.6432600607208703
(St& John 3:7).   Being convinced that salvation is    1.4513752902486308
alone by accepting Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy    1.6432600607208703
Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort to be saved    1.7026049541338664
by any form of good works, and just now receive Jesus as my personal    1.7026049541338664
Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him.   1.5127085093302464
YOU MAY DO AS YOU    1.1606783668269585
PLEASE with God now. It is permitted. God placed Himself in men's    1.6432600607208703
hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God    1.6432600607208703
and perfect Man in one Being. He was then in man's hands. They    1.67495327387791
cursed Him. It was permitted. Men spit on Him. God allowed it.    1.6432600607208703
They called Him a devil. God withheld His wrath. Finally men arrested    1.6432600607208703
Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged Him, nailed Him on a cross    1.67495327387791
and hung Him between earth and heaven; and God allowed it.   1.6065767145351917
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present. You can    1.6432600607208703
ignore Him. You can ignore His Book, the Bible, and His church.    1.6432600607208703
You    1.0
can laugh at His blood-bought salvation, curse His followers, and    1.5636360329510388
laugh at hell. It is permitted. The eternal Christ may knock at your    1.67495327387791
soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven.    1.6432600607208703
You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him a devil, curse Him. It    1.7026049541338664
is permitted. You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses    1.7026049541338664
if you so choose. He is in your hands- <now>.   On the    1.6432600607208703
other hand, you may seek His favor, humble yourself before Him and beg    1.67495327387791
His mercy, implore His forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon    1.5636360329510388
your whole life to Him. He has said, "Behold, I stand at the door,    1.7026049541338664
and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will    1.7026049541338664
come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation    1.7026049541338664
3:20). The choice is up to you. The latch is on your side of the    1.7269387314284994
door. The choice is yours: the revellings and banquetings of this    1.6065767145351917
world or quiet communion with God; the ever burning lusts of the flesh    1.67495327387791
or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline. The choice is    1.6065767145351917
yours: God is in your hands, <now>.   God has already set    1.6065767145351917
the day when <you will be in His hands>. What He does with you <then>    1.7269387314284994
depends on what you do with Him <now>. <Then> it will be    1.6432600607208703
a "fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" if you    1.7026049541338664
have abused Him in your hands.    1.2818970554302986
I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts; this issue that you are    1.67495327387791
reading marks my 15th anniversary.   When I came into being, 15    1.6065767145351917
years ago, I had one primary purpose: to help men and women everywhere    1.67495327387791
to know God better, and through knowing Him better to become happier    1.6432600607208703
and more effective people. That purpose has never changed.   1.5127085093302464
When you read me, you are holding in your hands the product of many    1.7026049541338664
minds and hearts. Some of the people who speak through my pages are    1.67495327387791
famous; others unknown. Some work with their hands. Some have walked    1.6065767145351917
through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope. Some    1.6432600607208703
are so filled with gratitude, for the gift of life and the love of God,    1.7269387314284994
that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands    1.7026049541338664
whom they have never known, and will never see.   Fifteen    1.5636360329510388
years ago, there were no Guideposts at all. This month a million    1.6432600607208703
Guideposts will circulate all over the world. Experts in the publishing    1.6065767145351917
field consider this astounding. They do not understand how a small    1.6065767145351917
magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved    1.6065767145351917
such a following.   To me, the explanation is very simple. I    1.6065767145351917
am not doing anything, of myself. I am merely a channel for **h <something>.   1.7026049541338664
What is this something? I cannot define it fully.    1.5127085093302464
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness, even    1.67495327387791
when they turn away from it. It is the power that holds the stars in    1.7269387314284994
their orbits, but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass. It is the    1.7269387314284994
whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is. It    1.7269387314284994
is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace.   1.6065767145351917
All things are possible to God, but He chooses- usually- to    1.6065767145351917
work through people. Sometimes such people sense that they are being    1.6065767145351917
used; sometimes not.   Fifteen years ago, troubled by the rising    1.5636360329510388
tide of materialism in the post-war world, a businessman and a minister    1.6432600607208703
asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine    1.67495327387791
in which men and women, regardless of creed or color, could set    1.6432600607208703
forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power    1.6065767145351917
of faith to solve the endless problems of living.   The businessman    1.6065767145351917
was Raymond Thornburg. The minister was Norman Vincent Peale.    1.5127085093302464
Neither had any publishing experience, but they had faith in their    1.6065767145351917
idea. They borrowed a typewriter, raised about $2,000 in contributions,    1.5636360329510388
hired a secretary, persuaded a couple of young men to join them for    1.67495327387791
almost no pay **h and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets    1.67495327387791
that they called Guideposts.   Compared to the big, established    1.5127085093302464
magazines, my first efforts seemed feeble indeed. But from the    1.5636360329510388
start they had two important ingredients: sincerity and realism. The    1.5636360329510388
people who told the stories were sincere. And the stories they told    1.6432600607208703
were true.   For example, early in my life, when one of my editorial    1.67495327387791
workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations    1.5636360329510388
met the needs of New York's down-and-outers, he didn't    1.5127085093302464
just ask questions. Len LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk    1.7026049541338664
derelict for ten days.   That was nearly 13 years ago. Len    1.6065767145351917
LeSourd is my executive editor today.   Many of you are familiar,    1.6065767145351917
I'm sure, with the story of my early struggles: the fire    1.6065767145351917
in January, 1947, that destroyed everything- even our precious list    1.5636360329510388
of subscribers. The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere.    1.6065767145351917
The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me.   1.6065767145351917
That was when a remarkable woman, Teresa Durlach, came to my    1.6065767145351917
aid- not so much with money, as with wisdom and courage. "You're    1.6432600607208703
not living up to your own principles", she told my discouraged people.    1.6432600607208703
"You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim.    1.5636360329510388
What do you want- a hundred thousand subscribers? Visualize    1.5127085093302464
them, then, believe you are getting them, and you <will> have them"!   1.6432600607208703
And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality. And then 500,000.    1.5636360329510388
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation.   1.5127085093302464
With our growth came expansion into new fields of service. Today    1.6065767145351917
more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees. They    1.6065767145351917
say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to    1.5636360329510388
meet. Hundreds of civic clubs, business firms and individuals make me    1.6065767145351917
available to school teachers throughout the land. They say it helps    1.6065767145351917
them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this    1.67495327387791
country was built.   Thousands of free copies are sent each    1.5636360329510388
month to chaplains in the Armed Forces, to prison libraries and to hospitals    1.67495327387791
everywhere. Bedridden people say I am easy to hold- and read.    1.6065767145351917
Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition    1.6065767145351917
for blind readers.   Throughout these exciting years I have been    1.5636360329510388
fortunate for, although I have never offered great financial inducements,    1.5636360329510388
talent has found its way to me: William Boal who so ably organizes    1.67495327387791
business operations; John Beach who guides circulation;    1.3761581156320553
Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business    1.6065767145351917
firms.   Searching for the best in spiritual stories, my    1.5127085093302464
roving editors cover not only the country, but the whole world. Glenn    1.6432600607208703
Kittler has been twice to Africa, once spending a week with Dr&    1.6432600607208703
Albert Schweitzer. Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were    1.5127085093302464
in Alaska. Van Varner recently returned from Russia.   Twice    1.5127085093302464
a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper,    1.67495327387791
then a long evening of idea-exchange. Around the table sit Protestant,    1.6065767145351917
Catholic, and Jew. Each contributes something different, and something    1.5127085093302464
important: Ruth Peale, her wide experience in church work;    1.5127085093302464
Sidney Fields, years of experience as a New York columnist; Catherine    1.6065767145351917
Marshall LeSourd the insight that has made her books world-famous    1.5636360329510388
and Norm Mullendore, the keen perception of an advertising    1.5127085093302464
executive.   There are people who travel long distances to assure    1.5636360329510388
my continued existence. Elaine St& Johns may fly in from the West    1.6432600607208703
Coast for the editorial staff meetings. Starr Jones gets up every    1.6065767145351917
morning at five o'clock, milks his family cow, attends to farm chores,    1.6432600607208703
and then takes a two-hour train trip to New York. Arthur Gordon    1.6432600607208703
comes once a month all the way from Georgia.   We have also    1.6432600607208703
seen the power of faith at work among us. Rose Weiss, who handles all    1.7026049541338664
the prayer-requests that we receive, answering each letter personally,    1.5127085093302464
has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering: she has had    1.6065767145351917
many major operations, and now gets about in a limited way on braces    1.67495327387791
and crutches. Recently, John Sherrill was stricken with one of the    1.6065767145351917
deadliest forms of cancer. We prayed for John, during surgery, we    1.6065767145351917
asked others to pray; all over the country a massive shield of prayer    1.67495327387791
was thrown around him. Today the cancer is gone.   Perhaps it    1.6065767145351917
is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all. But, you    1.6432600607208703
see, those who are not mentioned will not resent it. That is the kind    1.7026049541338664
of people they are.   Perhaps you think the editorial meetings    1.5636360329510388
are solemn affairs, a little sanctimonious? Not so. Serious, yes,    1.5636360329510388
but also much laughter. Sharp division of opinion, too, and strenuous    1.6065767145351917
debate. There are brain-wracking searches for the right word, the best    1.6065767145351917
phrase, the most helpful idea. And there is also something intangible    1.6065767145351917
that hovers around the table. A good word for it is fellowship.    1.6432600607208703
A shorter word is love.   Each meeting starts with a prayer, offered    1.6432600607208703
spontaneously by one member of the group. It takes many forms,    1.6065767145351917
this prayer, but in essence it is always a request for guidance, for open    1.7026049541338664
minds and gentle hearts, for honesty and sincerity, for the wisdom    1.6065767145351917
and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers.   For you,    1.5636360329510388
readers, are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that    1.5636360329510388
is Guideposts. I need your support, your criticism, your encouragement,    1.5636360329510388
your prayers.   I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts.    1.5636360329510388
My message, today, is the same as it was 15 years ago: that there    1.7026049541338664
is goodness in people, and strength and love in God.   May He    1.6432600607208703
bless you all.   1.0
HAVANA was filled with an excitement which you could see    1.5636360329510388
in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices.    1.7026049541338664
The hated dictator Batista had fled. Rumors flew from lip to lip    1.6432600607208703
that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana, coming from the mountains    1.67495327387791
where he had fought Batista for five years. Already the city was    1.6432600607208703
filled with Barbudos, the bearded, war-dirty Revolutionaries, carrying    1.4513752902486308
carbines, waving to the crowds that lined the Prado.   And    1.5636360329510388
then Castro himself did come, bearded, smiling; yet if you looked closely    1.6432600607208703
you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips.   1.7026049541338664
At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper    1.6432600607208703
behind this man. I am sure that Castro was happy, too, about that support.    1.7026049541338664
<Diario de la Marina> was the oldest and most influential paper    1.6065767145351917
in Cuba, with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny. My    1.6065767145351917
grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials. My own earliest    1.6065767145351917
memories are of exiles: my three brothers and I were taken often    1.6432600607208703
to the United States "to visit relatives" while my father stayed    1.6065767145351917
on to fight the dictator Machado.   When it was my turn, I, too,    1.67495327387791
printed the truth as I knew it about Batista, and rejoiced to see    1.67495327387791
his regime topple. None of us was aware that the biggest fight was    1.67495327387791
still ahead.   I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana.    1.67495327387791
Within a week, however, I began to suspect that something was    1.6065767145351917
wrong. For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom, but hatred. He spent    1.6432600607208703
long hours before the ~TV spitting out promises of revenge. He    1.6065767145351917
showed us how he dealt with his enemies: he executed them before    1.6432600607208703
~TV cameras. On home sets children were watching the death throes    1.6065767145351917
of men who were shot before the paredon, the firing wall.   Castro's    1.6432600607208703
reforms? He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance. New    1.5636360329510388
schools were rising, but with this went a harsh proclamation: any    1.6065767145351917
academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid.    1.4513752902486308
Economic aid? He had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily he cut    1.5636360329510388
all rents in half, whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator    1.6065767145351917
or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room. Under    1.7026049541338664
another law, hundreds of farms were seized. Farm workers had their wages    1.6432600607208703
cut almost in half. Of this, only 50 cents a day was paid in cash,    1.7269387314284994
the rest in script usable only in "People's Stores".   1.5127085093302464
A    1.0
suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist. In my mind,    1.6432600607208703
I began to review: his use of hate to gain support; his People's    1.67495327387791
Courts; his division of society into two classes, one the hero,    1.6065767145351917
the other the villain. But most disturbing of all were the advisers    1.6432600607208703
he called to sit with him in the Palace; many came from Communist    1.67495327387791
countries.   What should I do about it, I asked myself?    1.5636360329510388
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon. There    1.6065767145351917
was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him, mobs would appear outside    1.7269387314284994
our windows shouting "Paredon! Paredon! **h"   What    1.3761581156320553
should I do? I was proud of the new buildings which housed <Diario>    1.67495327387791
now: the rotogravures, gleaming behind glass doors; the thump    1.5127085093302464
and whir of our new presses. Here was a powerful, ready-made medium,    1.6432600607208703
but it could speak only if I told it to.   Then one day, early    1.7026049541338664
in January, 1960, I sat down at my desk, and suddenly I was aware    1.7026049541338664
of the crucifix. It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had    1.67495327387791
given me. I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind    1.748515906000203
me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner.    1.67495327387791
Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness    1.7026049541338664
in His eyes, saying:   "You will lose the paper. You may    1.6065767145351917
lose your life. But do you have any choice"?   I knew in that    1.67495327387791
moment that I did <not> have any choice. From that day on I began    1.7026049541338664
to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in    1.6432600607208703
Fidel Castro's regime.    1.0
@   Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly    1.6065767145351917
either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to "lift all    1.5636360329510388
those old barbell things" because "you'll stunt your growth"    1.5127085093302464
**h or because childish taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey **h    1.6065767145351917
lookit Mr& America **h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles (of    1.6432600607208703
which he has none at the time)"?   After all, a guy's gotta    1.6432600607208703
have a little ego!   Therefore it's a genuine pleasure    1.5127085093302464
to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has <never> had    1.6432600607208703
to train in secret **h has <never> heard one unkind word from his parents    1.7026049541338664
**h and <never> has been taunted by his schoolmates!    1.5127085093302464
This happy, always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new    1.6432600607208703
<Junior Mr& Canada>- Henri de Courcy.   Far from discouraging    1.5127085093302464
Henri, his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments.    1.6065767145351917
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they    1.5636360329510388
personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority,    1.5127085093302464
Professor Roland Claude.   And they couldn't have entrusted    1.4513752902486308
Henri to better hands because "le professeur" knows his muscles    1.5636360329510388
from the <sterno-cleido mastoideus> of the neck right down to the <tibialis    1.6432600607208703
anticus> of the leg **h and better still, he knows just what    1.6432600607208703
exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine    1.6065767145351917
them with for fast, <fast> muscle growth.   That's because the    1.5636360329510388
good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal    1.5636360329510388
Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt& Royal East in Montreal.    1.6432600607208703
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning    1.6432600607208703
pupils (every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other).    1.6432600607208703
There's Gaetan d'Amours who is our newest <Mr& Canada>    1.5127085093302464
**h Jean-Paul Senesac, whose story appeared here two issues ago    1.5636360329510388
**h Jack Boissoneault, who was with us last month **h Charles Harve,    1.6432600607208703
who recently won the "Most Muscular Man" subdivision award    1.5127085093302464
in the {Mr& Canada} event **h and a host of others. Yesiree **h    1.67495327387791
the professor knows his muscles!   Now when Henri was just    1.5636360329510388
12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds,    1.67495327387791
and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight. About that time    1.67495327387791
he began reading {Mr& America} and {Muscle Builder}    1.4513752902486308
and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining. Seeing    1.67495327387791
so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value    1.6065767145351917
of {Quick-Wate} and {Super-Protein}, those two wonder-working    1.3761581156320553
Weider food supplements, he decided to try them and see what they    1.6432600607208703
could do for him.   Well, sir **h they did real great! For    1.6432600607208703
in almost less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight was    1.67495327387791
increasing rapidly. Of course he did some exercising **h he's crazy    1.6065767145351917
about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction    1.6065767145351917
with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle    1.5636360329510388
on his skinny frame.   Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming    1.6432600607208703
and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much.    1.6432600607208703
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body. It was muscular    1.6432600607208703
but it wasn't symmetrical. "A real 'nothing' torso", says    1.5127085093302464
Henri. "It never seemed to widen **h it just got longer and longer".   1.67495327387791
That's when he went to Professor Claude. And at    1.5127085093302464
once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct    1.7026049541338664
it. In his gym the professor has some of the most "knocked out" equipment    1.7026049541338664
since Vic Tanny. Mr& Claude is a specialist in torso development    1.6065767145351917
and he has long favored the now-famous Weider {Push-Pull    1.5127085093302464
Super-Set} technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is    1.5636360329510388
a {pressing} or "pushing" movement which accents one sector of    1.5636360329510388
a muscle group in a specific way, followed by a "pulling" exercise    1.6432600607208703
which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.   So    1.6065767145351917
right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous "moon" bench    1.5636360329510388
and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting    1.5636360329510388
of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover (the "pull" part of the    1.5636360329510388
Push-Pull Super-Set) which dramatically widens the ribcage and    1.4513752902486308
strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest **h and the    1.67495327387791
collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to    1.5636360329510388
build those wide, Reeves-type "gladiator" ~pecs, while stimulating    1.4513752902486308
the upper ~lats and frontal deltoids.   As you can see,    1.5636360329510388
in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is    1.5636360329510388
vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises **h so    1.5636360329510388
the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   Now when    1.5636360329510388
Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 1,    1.5127085093302464
the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting    1.6065767145351917
him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 2.   Super-Set    1.5127085093302464
No& 2 is made up of similar exercises, but this time done    1.6432600607208703
with dumbbells, and using both "moon" and flat benches. The "push"    1.6065767145351917
exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done    1.5636360329510388
with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of    1.6432600607208703
the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation. You need the    1.6065767145351917
barbell variation to build width and mass in the ~pecs **h the dumbbell    1.67495327387791
variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the ~pecs.   1.5636360329510388
The "pull" exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell    1.5127085093302464
Bent-Arm Pullover.    1.0
(Note how strongly    1.0
the upper ~lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise    1.6065767145351917
because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation    1.6065767145351917
affords).   In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the "push"    1.4513752902486308
exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the "pull"    1.5636360329510388
exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms.   1.5636360329510388
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage    1.5636360329510388
stretcher ever invented! This is true {only} if a very wide grip    1.6432600607208703
is used and {only} when the {greatest possible stretch} is    1.5636360329510388
achieved. You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because    1.5636360329510388
your shoulder blades will touch! As you see, the professor has designed    1.6432600607208703
a piece of apparatus that {forces} the bodybuilder to use    1.5636360329510388
a w-i-d-e grip **h he has to; he just can't do anything about it at    1.7269387314284994
all!   But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise    1.6432600607208703
at all, because Henri de Courcy- the "happy" bodybuilder-    1.5127085093302464
looks as though he were having the time of his life!   The last    1.67495327387791
exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single    1.6065767145351917
exercise, done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between    1.6065767145351917
sets. By this time Henri's entire chest-back-~lat-shoulder area    1.4513752902486308
is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to    1.6065767145351917
do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work. He has Henri do    1.6432600607208703
from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press (note the high incline).    1.7026049541338664
This gives a wide flare to the ~pecs, causing them to flow    1.6432600607208703
dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the    1.5127085093302464
serratus and ~lats.   This is the kind of chest that invariably    1.6065767145351917
wins contests **h that steel-edged "carved-out-of-solid rock" looks    1.4513752902486308
of the great champions.   So with four complete Push-Pull    1.5127085093302464
Super-Sets No& 1, four of No& 2, four of No& 3 and four to    1.7026049541338664
six sets of the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri de Courcy    1.7026049541338664
has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping, torso-defining    1.3761581156320553
workout that cannot be improved upon.    1.2818970554302986
@   Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone **h    1.5636360329510388
rarer still is a <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> of true Herculean    1.6432600607208703
build. The aspects of physical development that catch the judges'    1.5636360329510388
eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry    1.5127085093302464
and that hallmark of the true champion- <superior definition>    1.5127085093302464
of the muscles.   1.0
Now <good> definition is one thing that all of us can    1.6065767145351917
acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight workouts.    1.3761581156320553
But <contest> definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every    1.5127085093302464
muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's    1.7026049541338664
chisel- is something quite different. This comes not alone    1.5127085093302464
from high-set, high-rep training, but from certain definition-specialization    1.4513752902486308
exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge    1.5636360329510388
of exactly what works best for <him>.   Often these exercises    1.5636360329510388
work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others.    1.5636360329510388
Because they are "minority" exercises and have but a limited    1.5636360329510388
appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten. Only    1.6432600607208703
when the newest <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> rediscovers    1.5127085093302464
them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and    1.6432600607208703
once again see how effective they really are.   The exercise I    1.6065767145351917
shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle    1.7026049541338664
definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the One    1.5127085093302464
Leg Lunge. Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say    1.7026049541338664
because it works perfectly for <everyone>, no matter whether he has    1.6065767145351917
short or long thigh-bone lengths!   It is the one exercise    1.5636360329510388
that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the {hipline}-    1.6065767145351917
that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other    1.6432600607208703
bodybuilders **h a criterion of muscle "drama" that is unforgettable    1.5636360329510388
to judges and audiences alike **h the facet of muscular development    1.6065767145351917
that wins prizes.   Definition of the thighs at the uppermost    1.5636360329510388
part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which    1.6065767145351917
is easily understandable. The One Leg Lunge is a {split} and    1.6065767145351917
all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.   But for    1.5636360329510388
purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular    1.5127085093302464
Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor programs- a heavy weight is    1.5636360329510388
not needed. Indeed, a lighter weight works much better because a greater,    1.6432600607208703
more extensive split can be performed. Used in several sets of    1.6065767145351917
high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire    1.7269387314284994
upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look    1.6432600607208703
like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin!   Really    1.5636360329510388
there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way    1.67495327387791
into your leg program at all times, for the following suggestions show    1.6432600607208703
why it is so effective: _1._ It's a {complete} thigh contraction-extension    1.6065767145351917
exercise. _2._ It places terrific tension on    1.3761581156320553
the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition. _3._ It    1.6432600607208703
improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder, and helps    1.5636360329510388
to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed. _4._ It    1.6065767145351917
increases flexibility of the legs. _5._ It speeds muscle growth    1.5636360329510388
and power development even for the {advanced} bodybuilder because    1.5127085093302464
each hip and leg is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated    1.6432600607208703
effort to be focused on each.   You'll need your Weider    1.5636360329510388
Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's    1.6065767145351917
done: _1._ Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their    1.6065767145351917
height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders    1.6432600607208703
when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean. _2._ Place    1.7269387314284994
a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar (which will    1.5636360329510388
rest against the back of your neck); extend your feet forward and    1.6432600607208703
backward until you are in a deep leg split.   Now raise the weight    1.67495327387791
by {straightening} your {front} leg, {without moving your    1.4513752902486308
feet}. When the front knee is straight and {locked}, allow it    1.6065767145351917
to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the    1.7026049541338664
sides of the Power Stands. _3._ After you have taken a breather,    1.6432600607208703
{reverse} the position of your legs so that the {front} thigh    1.6065767145351917
of the {previous} exercise is now to the {rear}, and the    1.6065767145351917
{rear} thigh now to the {front}, and perform the same movement    1.6065767145351917
in the same manner.   That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell.    1.6065767145351917
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you    1.67495327387791
make your first    1.0
experiments **h just for safety. You should also begin    1.5127085093302464
this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed    1.6065767145351917
to it balance-wise.   Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit    1.6065767145351917
at first. But don't worry. Before your first training experiment    1.5636360329510388
has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it    1.7026049541338664
you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!   1.5636360329510388
Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the {back} of    1.6432600607208703
the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments    1.6065767145351917
with the bar held in {front} of the neck. Squat-style lifters and    1.6432600607208703
leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those    1.5127085093302464
variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the    1.6065767145351917
{left} and {right} leg to the {front}.   1.3761581156320553
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bed of pansies I've seen was in a South    1.6432600607208703
Dakota yard on a sizzling day. Pansies are supposed to like it    1.6432600607208703
cool, but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring    1.67495327387791
sun. I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce    1.7026049541338664
such beauties in that weather. He seemed puzzled by my question.    1.6065767145351917
"I just love them", he said.   The more I talked with him,    1.6432600607208703
the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous    1.67495327387791
blooming. Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.    1.5636360329510388
He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from a pansy specialist.    1.6432600607208703
These specialists, I learned, have done a great deal of work to    1.6432600607208703
improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers. Their    1.67495327387791
seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the    1.6065767145351917
unimproved strains.   I asked him if he took seeds from his own    1.6432600607208703
plants. Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he wanted    1.6065767145351917
more of he did; but pansy seeds, he told me, soon "run down". It's    1.7026049541338664
best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.   1.7026049541338664
His soil was "nothing special", just prairie land, but    1.5127085093302464
he had harrowed in compost until it was loose, spongy and brown-black.    1.6432600607208703
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the    1.67495327387791
right texture, tilth and body. It isn't easy to describe it, but every    1.67495327387791
gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.   Nothing    1.5636360329510388
is easier to grow from seed than pansies. They germinate quickly, the    1.6432600607208703
tiny plants appearing in a week, and grow along lustily. It doesn't    1.6432600607208703
really matter which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate    1.67495327387791
best when they have a wide variation of temperature, very warm followed    1.6432600607208703
by cool in the same 24 hours.   I like to make a seedbed    1.67495327387791
right in the open, though many people start them successfully in cold    1.6432600607208703
frames. Pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things    1.6065767145351917
rugged, with only moderate protection on the coldest days. If you    1.6065767145351917
do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.   1.6432600607208703
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to    1.7026049541338664
encourage rooting. I dig it, rake it smooth, sow the seeds and wet them    1.7026049541338664
down with a fog spray. Then I cover the sowing with a board. This    1.7026049541338664
keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds. Ants carry away    1.67495327387791
the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.   1.67495327387791
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board. A    1.6432600607208703
light, porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft    1.67495327387791
during these early days of growth. I like sawdust for this, or hay.   1.67495327387791
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants, it's    1.67495327387791
time to set them out where they are to remain. Every time you transplant    1.7026049541338664
a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller. The moral is:    1.6432600607208703
don't transplant it any oftener than you must. As soon as they    1.6432600607208703
are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches apart where they are    1.7026049541338664
to bloom. I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed    1.67495327387791
bone meal into each hole with the plant. That encourages rooting, and    1.6432600607208703
the better developed the roots, the larger and more plentiful the flowers.   1.6432600607208703
Pansies are gluttons. I doubt if it is possible to overfeed    1.6065767145351917
them. I spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that,    1.6065767145351917
decayed manure spread over the bed is fine. One year I simply set the    1.7026049541338664
plants in the remains of a compost pile, to which a little sand had    1.7026049541338664
been added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my, or any of my    1.7269387314284994
neighbors' experience. In addition to the rich soil they benefit by    1.6065767145351917
feedings of manure water every other week, diluted to the color of weak    1.67495327387791
tea. As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved in water    1.6065767145351917
to half the strength in the directions, may be used.   They    1.6065767145351917
need mulch. We put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use    1.7026049541338664
a heavy one. Three inches of porous material will do a good job of    1.7026049541338664
keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.   When winter comes    1.6432600607208703
be ready with additional mulch. I like hay for this and apply it    1.67495327387791
so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost. That    1.7269387314284994
keeps in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate    1.6432600607208703
freezing and thawing.   Don't miss the pansies that appear    1.5127085093302464
from time to time through the winter. Whenever there is a thaw or    1.67495327387791
a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or    1.7026049541338664
two. If those aren't enough for you, why not grow some just for winter    1.7026049541338664
blooming? The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February    1.6065767145351917
during a particularly cold winter. I started the seed in a flat    1.6432600607208703
in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame. (An unheated    1.7026049541338664
greenhouse would have been better, if I had had one.) The plants    1.6432600607208703
took zero nights in their stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over    1.7026049541338664
the glass to protect them. In response to the lengthening days of February    1.67495327387791
they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers. That    1.5127085093302464
cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a    1.7026049541338664
border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it. Like    1.7026049541338664
strawberries in December, pansies are far more exciting in February    1.5636360329510388
than in May. Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold    1.7269387314284994
and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.   1.67495327387791
The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your plants becoming    1.6432600607208703
"leggy", running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms.    1.5636360329510388
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth, using a bobby    1.6432600607208703
pin to hold it there. Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and    1.67495327387791
each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little    1.6432600607208703
plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season. As soon as an experimental    1.748515906000203
tug assures you that roots have taken over, cut it off from    1.6432600607208703
the mother plant.   A second and also good practice is to shear    1.6432600607208703
off the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each    1.748515906000203
branch. These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time    1.6065767145351917
and will behave just as they did in early spring. I like to shear half    1.7269387314284994
my plants at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while the    1.7026049541338664
second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.   Probably    1.6432600607208703
no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to    1.7269387314284994
let the blossoms go to seed. Nature's aim, different from ours, is    1.6432600607208703
to provide for the coming generation. That done, her work is accomplished    1.6432600607208703
and she ignores the plant.   Here is a word of advice when    1.6432600607208703
you go shopping for your pansy seeds. Go to a reputable grower, preferably    1.67495327387791
a pansy specialist. It is no harder to raise big, healthy, blooming    1.6432600607208703
plants than weak, sickly little things; in fact it is easier. But    1.6432600607208703
you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.   Many    1.6432600607208703
people think that pansies last only a few weeks, then their period    1.6432600607208703
of growth and bloom is over. That is not true. If the plants are cared    1.7269387314284994
for and protected over the winter, the second year is more prolific    1.6432600607208703
than the first.   Would you like to grow exhibition pansies?    1.5636360329510388
Remove about half the branches from each plant, leaving only the strongest    1.6432600607208703
with the largest buds. The flowers will be huge.   Pansies    1.5636360329510388
have character. They stick to their principles, insist upon their    1.5636360329510388
due, but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it. Treat    1.6432600607208703
them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except    1.67495327387791
the frigid ones. Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and more    1.6432600607208703
food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.   1.4513752902486308
A SALAD WITH    1.0
greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition    1.5636360329510388
to a meal, but add an avocado and you have something really special.    1.67495327387791
This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past    1.5636360329510388
thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible    1.5636360329510388
to ship avocado anywhere in the United States. It has a great    1.6432600607208703
many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part    1.67495327387791
of your diet yet, you really should.   You will find that avocado    1.6432600607208703
is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted. It is roughly shaped    1.67495327387791
like a large pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin covers    1.67495327387791
a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe    1.6432600607208703
Bartlett pear, but oily. The avocado should have a "give" to it,    1.6432600607208703
as you hold it, when it is ripe. The flavor is neither sweet, like    1.7026049541338664
a pear, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland, nut-like.    1.7026049541338664
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not    1.67495327387791
because it is unpleasant, but because the flavor is hard to define in    1.67495327387791
the light of our experience with other fruits. Sometimes it takes several    1.6432600607208703
"eatings" of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste    1.5636360329510388
that has made it such a favorite throughout the world. Once you become    1.67495327387791
an avocado fan, you will look forward to the season each year with    1.67495327387791
eager anticipation.    1.0
Today,    1.0
refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible    1.5127085093302464
to any place in the world. The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree,    1.7269387314284994
but it is still firm at this point. It is brought to packing houses,    1.7026049541338664
cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed in protective    1.6432600607208703
excelsior. The fruit is then cooled to 42`F&, a temperature at which    1.6432600607208703
it lapses into a sort of dormant state. This cooling does not change    1.67495327387791
the avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening of    1.6432600607208703
the fruit until a grovelike temperature (room temperature) is restored.    1.5636360329510388
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.   One    1.6065767145351917
of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require    1.67495327387791
processing of any kind. There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing    1.6432600607208703
needed. If the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado will delay    1.6065767145351917
its ripening until needed. And unlike other fruits, one cannot eat    1.6065767145351917
the skin of the avocado. It is thick, much like an egg plant's skin,    1.7026049541338664
so that poison sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the    1.67495327387791
consumer.    1.0
Good taste and    1.0
versatility,    1.0
plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend    1.5636360329510388
the frequent use of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were    1.67495327387791
limited. Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients. Their main    1.5636360329510388
asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining    1.6432600607208703
the good health of the circulatory system. Aside from this,    1.5636360329510388
the average portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount of vitamins    1.6065767145351917
~A and ~C- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement,    1.5636360329510388
and about a third of the official vitamin ~E requirement. The    1.6065767145351917
~B vitamins are well represented, especially thiamin and riboflavin.    1.5127085093302464
Calcium, phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts,    1.5127085093302464
and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts.    1.6432600607208703
None of these values is destroyed, not significantly altered by refrigeration    1.6065767145351917
storage.   Dr& Wilson C& Grant, of the Veterans'    1.4513752902486308
Administration Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University    1.4513752902486308
of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if avocados,    1.6065767145351917
because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids, would reduce    1.6065767145351917
the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients. The study comprised    1.6065767145351917
16 male patients, ranging in age from 27 to 72. They were put    1.67495327387791
on control diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal cholesterol    1.6432600607208703
level of their blood. Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados    1.6432600607208703
per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.   1.6432600607208703
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, FIRE! The tremendous energy    1.5127085093302464
released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than    1.6432600607208703
it can be heard. The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the    1.6432600607208703
pit of your stomach.   Never before has the introduction of a weapon    1.6432600607208703
caused so much apprehension and fear. Nuclear weapons are fearsome,    1.5636360329510388
but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless    1.6065767145351917
swiftness which is much more terrifying.   A great many writers    1.5636360329510388
are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker    1.5127085093302464
would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear    1.6432600607208703
rockets. It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that    1.67495327387791
an attacker, in possession of such absolute power, would simultaneously    1.5636360329510388
destroy his opponent's cities and people. With a nation defenseless    1.5636360329510388
before it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people?    1.5636360329510388
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical    1.6065767145351917
act of complete subjugation? The nation would be utterly devastated.    1.5636360329510388
The will of its people, so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.   1.7026049541338664
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction    1.5636360329510388
in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means    1.6432600607208703
to destroy itself in minutes. At this point it should be painfully obvious    1.67495327387791
that cities, being "soft", and the people within them are ideally    1.6065767145351917
suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.   However, because    1.4513752902486308
this vulnerability is mutual, it is to the advantage of neither side    1.6432600607208703
to destroy the opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent    1.6432600607208703
has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal. It should be appallingly    1.6432600607208703
apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.   1.5127085093302464
~ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in    1.6065767145351917
two different ways. They could be used to attack a nation's people    1.6432600607208703
(which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people),    1.6065767145351917
or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military    1.6432600607208703
force.   If our national interest lies in being able to    1.5636360329510388
fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide, then we must    1.67495327387791
take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles. We must    1.6065767145351917
determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves. We must make    1.67495327387791
certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job    1.6432600607208703
to the missile.   Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they    1.5636360329510388
also have their too little known limitations.   Because of a missile's    1.6065767145351917
ballistic trajectory, the location of a fixed target must be    1.5636360329510388
known quite accurately. Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads,    1.5636360329510388
highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them with    1.5636360329510388
passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range    1.6065767145351917
ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying    1.4513752902486308
a mobile or moving target with such weapons. One must first <detect>    1.6432600607208703
a fleeting mobile or moving target, <decide> that it is worthy of    1.6432600607208703
destruction, <select> the missile to be fired against the target,    1.5636360329510388
<compute> ballistics for the flight, and <prepare> the missile for    1.5636360329510388
firing.   Even if all these operations could be performed <instantaneously>,    1.5636360329510388
the ~ICBM still has a time of flight to the target    1.6065767145351917
of about 30 minutes. Therefore, if the target can significantly change    1.6065767145351917
its location in something less than 30 minutes, the probability of    1.6065767145351917
having destroyed it is drastically lowered.   Because of this,    1.5127085093302464
it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic    1.5636360329510388
missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile    1.5636360329510388
defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.   1.5636360329510388
In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving, or imprecisely    1.5636360329510388
located strategic forces, we must have a hunter-killer capability    1.5127085093302464
<in addition> to our missiles. Until this hunter-killer operation    1.5127085093302464
can be performed by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only    1.6432600607208703
means available to us.   It seems reasonable that if general    1.5636360329510388
nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's    1.67495327387791
citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance    1.6432600607208703
aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and    1.6065767145351917
destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.    1.5127085093302464
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ~ICBM    1.6065767145351917
force. It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the ~B-52    1.6432600607208703
or ~B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based    1.4513752902486308
missiles. If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton    1.5636360329510388
nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which    1.5636360329510388
may be more appropriate for most important military targets, it would    1.6065767145351917
seem that the ~B-52 or ~B-70 could carry a great many small    1.6432600607208703
nuclear weapons.   An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons    1.6065767145351917
could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains    1.6065767145351917
operating within a specified geographic area of Russia- provided that    1.5636360329510388
we had used some of our ~ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses    1.6432600607208703
before our bombers got there. The aircraft could be used to destroy    1.6432600607208703
other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets as well as    1.5636360329510388
the known, fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by    1.6432600607208703
missile.   Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important    1.5636360329510388
role for manned military aircraft? Is there any other way to do    1.6432600607208703
the job?   Survivability of our strategic forces (Polaris,    1.4513752902486308
mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan, and airborne    1.5636360329510388
Skybolt) means that it will take some time, perhaps weeks, to destroy    1.6432600607208703
a strategic force. War, under these circumstances, cannot be one    1.5636360329510388
massive exchange of nuclear devastation. Forces <will survive> a surprise    1.5636360329510388
attack, and these forces will give depth, or considerable duration,    1.5636360329510388
THE forces which survive the initial    1.2818970554302986
attack    1.0
must be found and destroyed. Even mobile forces must be found and    1.6432600607208703
destroyed. But, how does one go about the job of finding and destroying    1.67495327387791
mobile forces? They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction    1.5127085093302464
by ballistic missile.   Some day, many years in the future, true    1.6065767145351917
spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets. But until    1.6432600607208703
we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to the hunter-killer    1.5636360329510388
problem is manned aircraft.   However, the aircraft which we have    1.5636360329510388
today are tied to large, "soft" airfields. Nuclear rockets can    1.5636360329510388
destroy airfields with ease. Here then is our problem: aircraft are    1.6065767145351917
vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions    1.6432600607208703
which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield,    1.6065767145351917
on which the aircraft is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile.    1.6432600607208703
This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission, weapon.    1.5636360329510388
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.   1.6065767145351917
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft    1.7026049541338664
in favor of the missile. But remember this- it isn't the <aircraft>    1.6432600607208703
which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets, it is the <airfield>.    1.5636360329510388
Eliminate the <vulnerability of aircraft on the ground> and you    1.5636360329510388
have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic    1.4513752902486308
missiles.   There are <four rather obvious ways> to reduce or    1.5636360329510388
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:   @ Put    1.5127085093302464
aircraft in "bomb-proof" hangars when they are on the ground.   1.5636360329510388
@ Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small (3,000-foot)    1.5636360329510388
airfields with runways. If we could use all the small airfields    1.6065767145351917
we have in this country, we could disperse our strategic aircraft    1.6065767145351917
by a factor of 10 or more.   @ Use nuclear propulsions to keep    1.6432600607208703
our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their    1.6432600607208703
useful life.   @ Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines,    1.4513752902486308
develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (~VTOL) long-range    1.1606783668269585
military aircraft.   We have the technology today with which to    1.5636360329510388
build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 ~psi. We    1.6065767145351917
could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters.    1.6065767145351917
Large,    1.0
long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability    1.5636360329510388
to take off from 3,000-foot runways, but they would require more powerful    1.6432600607208703
engines than we have today. There is little enthusiasm for spending    1.6065767145351917
money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief    1.6065767145351917
that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.   This    1.6065767145351917
same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted    1.6065767145351917
in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.    1.5636360329510388
One seldom hears the analogy "nuclear propulsion will do for    1.5636360329510388
the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine".   If,    1.6065767145351917
for some reason such as economy, we are not going to develop aircraft    1.67495327387791
nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency, then we should    1.6065767145351917
turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio    1.6065767145351917
of 12 or 15 to one. With powerplants such as these, vertical takeoff    1.67495327387791
and landing combat aircraft could be built. For example, a 12-to-one    1.6065767145351917
engine would power a <supersonic> ~VTOL fighter. With a 15-to-one    1.5636360329510388
engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise    1.5127085093302464
vertically. The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to    1.6432600607208703
develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a    1.6065767145351917
billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft    1.6432600607208703
are obsolete.   When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields,    1.5636360329510388
they are no longer vulnerable to ~ICBMs. If our ~SAC    1.5636360329510388
bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and    1.6065767145351917
<because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability    1.5636360329510388
to strike at Russia again, and again, and again>, those bombers would    1.6432600607208703
unquestionably assure our military dominance.   We would have    1.4513752902486308
the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it    1.6432600607208703
were fixed or mobile. With such a force of manned bombers we could bring    1.7026049541338664
enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure would be    1.6432600607208703
selective and extremely discriminating. No need to kill an entire city    1.6065767145351917
and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance    1.6065767145351917
to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.   Our first    1.5127085093302464
necessity, at the very outset of war, is post-attack reconnaissance.    1.5636360329510388
In a few years we will have ~SAMOS (semiautomatic missile observation    1.6065767145351917
system). But in the case of moving targets, and targets which    1.6065767145351917
have limited mobility, what will their location be when it is time to    1.67495327387791
destroy them? What targets have we successfully knocked out? A    1.5636360329510388
ballistic missile cannot, today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.    1.6432600607208703
What targets still remain to be hit? These crucial questions    1.5636360329510388
must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance. ~SAMOS will    1.4513752902486308
be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark.    1.67495327387791
Even if this is some day possible, there remains the 30-minute time    1.6432600607208703
of flight of a missile to its overseas target. If the target can change    1.7026049541338664
its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in    1.6065767145351917
the air on its way, the probability of the missile destroying the target    1.67495327387791
is drastically reduced.   <Pre>-attack reconnaissance is vital    1.3761581156320553
but only <post>-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate    1.5127085093302464
the war favorably. It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather    1.67495327387791
that post-attack reconnaissance. It could operate under the clouds    1.5127085093302464
and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night.    1.5127085093302464
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately    1.6432600607208703
destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile    1.6432600607208703
to come all the way from the United States with the chance that    1.67495327387791
the target, if it were mobile, would be gone.   A large aircraft,    1.6432600607208703
such as the ~B-52 or ~B-70, could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small    1.67495327387791
nuclear weapons. Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive    1.6065767145351917
power will create 1,000 ~psi overpressure at 100 feet. Or    1.5636360329510388
put    1.0
another way, the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed    1.6065767145351917
by placing a one-kiloton warhead (1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima    1.67495327387791
and Nagasaki) within 100 to 200 feet of the target!   1.5636360329510388
It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large    1.7026049541338664
yield nuclear weapons.   Today we have side-looking radar which    1.5127085093302464
has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual    1.6065767145351917
buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate spans of bridges, etc&.    1.4513752902486308
With these keen "eyes" and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy,    1.6065767145351917
military forces can be directly attacked <with minimum damage    1.5127085093302464
to urban areas>.   If we fail to develop the means to hunt down    1.67495327387791
and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision,    1.6065767145351917
and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace,    1.67495327387791
our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.   1.4513752902486308
THE LYRIC BEAUTIES of Schubert's <Trout> Quintet-    1.3761581156320553
its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source    1.5636360329510388
of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners. But for students of    1.6432600607208703
musical forms and would-be classifiers, the work presents its problems.    1.5636360329510388
Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the    1.67495327387791
category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument    1.67495327387791
generally regarded as symphonic. Moreover, the piece is written    1.5127085093302464
in five movements, rather than the conventional four of most quintets,    1.6065767145351917
and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.   The    1.6065767145351917
many and frequent performances of the <Trout> serve to emphasize    1.5636360329510388
the dual nature of its writing. Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions,    1.6432600607208703
with the contrabass given free rein. Other interpretations present    1.5127085093302464
the music as an essentially intimate creation. In these readings,    1.5636360329510388
the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background, or it    1.6432600607208703
is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in    1.6432600607208703
a china shop. Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches,    1.6432600607208703
when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer    1.7026049541338664
than ten different performances. The occasion for this marathon:    1.5127085093302464
Angel's long-awaited reissue in its "Great Recordings of the    1.5127085093302464
Century" series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version. Let me say at    1.6065767145351917
the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as    1.67495327387791
it did on the first.   Whether considered alone or in relation    1.6065767145351917
to other editions, ~COLH 40 is a document of prime importance.    1.6065767145351917
Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart    1.4513752902486308
players of all time, and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable.    1.7026049541338664
But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great    1.6432600607208703
performer, and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to    1.67495327387791
are by Schnabel pupils (Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian Aeschbacher,    1.5636360329510388
and Victor Babin) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical    1.5636360329510388
skills. Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian    1.5636360329510388
renditions, most notably the "Schnabel trill" (which differs    1.4513752902486308
from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously).    1.6432600607208703
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction    1.4513752902486308
as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each    1.6065767145351917
student's approach as distinctly his own.   Schnabel's emphasis    1.4513752902486308
on structural clarity, his innate rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous    1.5127085093302464
intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one. Yet no    1.67495327387791
detail was too small to receive attention from this master, and as a    1.67495327387791
result the playing here has humor, delicacy, and radiant humanity. This    1.6065767145351917
is a serious-minded interpretation, but it is never strait-laced. And    1.5636360329510388
although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously    1.5127085093302464
faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications.    1.4513752902486308
The piano performance on this <Trout> is one that really demands    1.6065767145351917
a search for superlatives.   About the Pro Arte's contribution    1.5127085093302464
I am less happy. I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't    1.6432600607208703
collaborate with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic    1.4513752902486308
playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook    1.6065767145351917
than the style of the Belgian group. From a technical standpoint,    1.6065767145351917
the string playing is good, but the Pro Arte people fail to enter    1.67495327387791
into the spirit of things here. The violinist, in particular, is very    1.6432600607208703
indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched and edgy.    1.6432600607208703
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone,    1.4513752902486308
but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very    1.67495327387791
quiet. There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation    1.6432600607208703
in the "<Forellen>" movement, and I suspect that this is    1.5636360329510388
due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original ~SPs.   1.5636360329510388
Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's (London) offers    1.5127085093302464
the most sophisticated keyboard work. Every detail in his interpretation    1.5636360329510388
has been beautifully thought out, and of these I would especially    1.6065767145351917
cite the delicious <la^ndler> touch the pianist brings to the fifth    1.6065767145351917
variation (an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese    1.5636360329510388
musicians), and the gossamer shading throughout. Some of Curzon's    1.5127085093302464
playing strikes me as finicky, however. Why, for example, does he favor    1.6432600607208703
<two> tempos, rather than one, for the third movement? The assisting    1.6065767145351917
musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in <expertise>,    1.5636360329510388
but their contribution is rustic and appealing. (Special compliments    1.5127085093302464
to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp: his scrawny,    1.5636360329510388
tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance.)   1.5127085093302464
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition (Concert-Disc) is a model of lucidity    1.5636360329510388
and organization. It is, moreover, a perfectly integrated ensemble    1.5127085093302464
effort. But having lived with the disc for some time now, I find    1.67495327387791
the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's    1.5127085093302464
(whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to    1.5636360329510388
be recorded) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's.    1.6432600607208703
Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound    1.6065767145351917
on his Decca disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating    1.7026049541338664
a copy of it.   The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet (Angel)    1.5127085093302464
and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet (~RCA Victor) editions    1.3761581156320553
give us superlative string playing (both in symphonic style) crippled    1.5636360329510388
by unimaginative piano playing. (Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's    1.5636360329510388
keyboard manner, but his playing is of limited insight.) Badura-Skoda-Vienna    1.5636360329510388
Konzerthaus (Westminster) and Demus-Schubert Quartet    1.1606783668269585
(Deutsche Grammophon) are both warm-toned, pleasantly lyrical,    1.3761581156320553
but rather slack and tensionless. Helmut Roloff, playing with a group    1.6065767145351917
of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in    1.6065767145351917
much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists. Telefunken    1.6065767145351917
has accorded him beautiful sound, and this bargain-priced disc (it    1.5636360329510388
sells for $2.98) is worthy of consideration.   Returning once again    1.5636360329510388
to the Schnabel reissue, I am beguiled anew by the magnificence    1.6065767145351917
of this pianist's musical penetration. Here is truly a "Great Recording    1.6065767145351917
of the Century", and its greatness is by no means diminished    1.6065767145351917
by the fact that it is not quite perfect. This recording surely belongs    1.67495327387791
in everyone's collection.    1.0
MUST records always sound like records?   From the beginning    1.5127085093302464
of commercial recording, new discs purported to be indistinguishable    1.5127085093302464
from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation. Seen    1.6065767145351917
in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones.    1.67495327387791
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude, they supply the    1.3761581156320553
ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation    1.5636360329510388
of the original. On the basis of what they give us we can know how the    1.748515906000203
young Caruso sang, appreciate the distinctive qualities of <Parsifal>    1.5127085093302464
under Karl Muck's baton, or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini    1.6065767145351917
created in his years with the New York Philharmonic.   Since    1.5636360329510388
the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago,    1.6065767145351917
the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold. In many    1.5636360329510388
cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational    1.5636360329510388
effects: the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning    1.5636360329510388
as the gap between sound and substance became clearer. Other    1.5636360329510388
innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing    1.5127085093302464
to acquire in time the status of classics. If we return to them today,    1.7026049541338664
we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them    1.6065767145351917
still pleasing.   Records sound like records because they provide    1.5127085093302464
a different sort of experience than live music. This difference is    1.6065767145351917
made up of many factors. Some of them are obvious, such as the fact    1.7026049541338664
that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior    1.6432600607208703
in different types of environments and social settings. (Music often    1.5636360329510388
sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something    1.67495327387791
more comfortable than a theatre seat.) From the technical standpoint,    1.5636360329510388
records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey    1.67495327387791
the true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity, pulse, and pitch    1.5636360329510388
of the original. Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion,    1.6432600607208703
although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced    1.6065767145351917
that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.    1.6432600607208703
Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the fitting together of    1.6065767145351917
fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness,    1.6065767145351917
that makes records sound like records. The sound may be good;    1.6065767145351917
but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what you are hearing    1.7026049541338664
is only a clever imitation.   Command's new Brahms Second is    1.5636360329510388
a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather    1.7026049541338664
than a copy of one. Like the recent <Scheherazade> from London    1.6065767145351917
(HIGH FIDELITY, Sept& 1961), it is successful because emphasis    1.5127085093302464
has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than    1.6065767145351917
on creating sensational effects. Because of this, only those with    1.5636360329510388
truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the    1.67495327387791
engineers' triumph.   The easiest way to describe this release    1.5127085093302464
is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg    1.6065767145351917
performance with minimal alteration of its musical values. The engineering    1.5636360329510388
as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness. The effect of    1.5636360329510388
the recording is very open and natural, with the frequency emphasis    1.6065767145351917
exactly what you would expect from a live performance. This absence of    1.6432600607208703
peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity, but    1.6065767145351917
it eliminates listener fatigue. A contributing factor is the perspective,    1.5636360329510388
the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained. The orchestra    1.5127085093302464
is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes, valve    1.67495327387791
clicks, and other noises incidental to playing. Yet you feel the orchestra    1.6432600607208703
is near at hand, and the individual instruments have the same firm    1.6432600607208703
presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically    1.6065767145351917
perfect hall. Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation.    1.5636360329510388
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its    1.6432600607208703
full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer. The    1.6065767145351917
timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.   1.5127085093302464
All of this would be wasted, of course, if the performance lacked    1.6432600607208703
authority and musical distinction. For me it has more of both elements    1.6432600607208703
than the majority of its competitors. Steinberg seems to have gone    1.6065767145351917
directly back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built his    1.6065767145351917
performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly    1.6065767145351917
what Brahms set down on paper.   Those accustomed to broader,    1.5636360329510388
more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react    1.6065767145351917
strongly when they hear this one. Without losing the distinctive undertow    1.6065767145351917
of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and the over-all performance    1.6065767145351917
has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.    1.6065767145351917
The <Presto ma non assai> of the first trio of the scherzo is    1.67495327387791
taken literally and may shock you, as the real <Allegro con spirito>    1.6432600607208703
of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet. In the end, however,    1.7269387314284994
the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way    1.6432600607208703
it sings. Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element    1.6432600607208703
which must dominate in this score, and he manages at times to create    1.67495327387791
the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.   The    1.5636360329510388
engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result. Too    1.6065767145351917
many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody    1.67495327387791
and its accompaniment. The Command technique invites you to listen    1.5636360329510388
to the depth of the orchestration. Your ear takes you into the ensemble,    1.67495327387791
and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously    1.6065767145351917
were apparent only in the score. It is this sort of experience    1.6432600607208703
that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance    1.6065767145351917
for the home music listener.    1.1606783668269585
The first substantially complete stereo <Giselle> (and the only one    1.5636360329510388
of its scope since Feyer's four-sided ~LP edition of 1958 for    1.6065767145351917
Angel), this set is, I'm afraid, likely to provide more horrid fascination    1.6432600607208703
than enjoyment. The already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve    1.5636360329510388
music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts    1.4513752902486308
between ultravehement brute power and chilly, if suave, sentimentality.    1.5127085093302464
And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic    1.5636360329510388
impact and earsplitting brilliance, the recording sounds as though    1.5127085093302464
it had been "doctored for super-high fidelity". The home listener    1.5636360329510388
is overpowered, all right, but the experience is a far from pleasant    1.6432600607208703
one. As with the penultimate <Giselle> release (Wolff's abridgment    1.5127085093302464
for ~RCA Victor) I find the cleaner, less razor-edged    1.5127085093302464
monophonic    1.0
version, for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness, the more    1.5636360329510388
aurally tolerable- but this may be the result of processing defects    1.6065767145351917
in my ~SD copies.   1.0
At the Westminster ~KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden,    1.5636360329510388
New York on the second day, the Finals of the Junior Class    1.6432600607208703
brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class.    1.6432600607208703
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far    1.67495327387791
south as Kentucky. This year several entries from Canada were entered    1.6065767145351917
which made the Junior Class International.   Forty-six of    1.4513752902486308
the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present. It was interesting    1.6432600607208703
to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other    1.67495327387791
classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class.   1.6432600607208703
As has been the custom for the past several years, John Cross,    1.6432600607208703
Jr&, Bench Show Chmn& of Westminster, arranged for the Juniors'    1.5636360329510388
meeting before the Class, and invited two speakers from the dog    1.6065767145351917
world to address them. Over 60 Juniors, parents and guests attended.    1.6065767145351917
After the Juniors    1.0
were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the    1.6065767145351917
Junior Class, Mrs& William H& Long, Jr& was introduced as    1.5636360329510388
the first speaker.   In her opening remarks Mrs& Long also    1.5636360329510388
welcomed the Juniors and stated, "There isn't any other show quite    1.6065767145351917
like Westminster. I know because this is my 37th year with hardly    1.6432600607208703
a break. Mrs& Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster    1.6432600607208703
which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably    1.6065767145351917
will not appreciate in full for a number of years.   Twenty    1.6065767145351917
years ago her daughter Betsey Long, then 13 years of age, won the    1.67495327387791
Grand Challenge Trophy, Children's Handling Class (as they were    1.5127085093302464
called then) at Westminster. No sooner had Betsey come out of the    1.6432600607208703
ring than Mrs& Long walked into the Working Competition with    1.5636360329510388
Ch& Cadet or Noranda, another home-bred product, and won!   1.5127085093302464
Speaking from long years of experience, Mrs& Long advised the Juniors:    1.6065767145351917
"<When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement>,    1.5127085093302464
STOP! Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings! When you and    1.6432600607208703
your dog step into the Junior ring, it should be just what the dog    1.7026049541338664
wants to do as much as what you want him to do. If you walk into the    1.7677783654484436
ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel it and give you    1.748515906000203
a good performance! He knows your signals, what is expected of him    1.6432600607208703
and the way the Class is conducted, right up through the flash-bulbs    1.6432600607208703
of the photographers".    1.0
"Take    1.0
away your attitude", said Mrs& Long, "and what have you left?    1.6065767145351917
Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage- a sure sign    1.67495327387791
that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop! Or a    1.67495327387791
bored dog because you are more interested in something else- maybe    1.6065767145351917
the way you look, or the date you have after the Class, or you are just    1.748515906000203
doing this to please the parents.   "The reason you are in    1.6065767145351917
the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most    1.7269387314284994
attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can    1.67495327387791
produce. Aids sounds more like a Pony Club, or horsemanship classes-    1.6065767145351917
riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!   "Your    1.6065767145351917
aids are your attitude, which comes through your voice, your hands    1.6065767145351917
and legs- voice to encourage, discourage or whatever the need may    1.6065767145351917
be; hands to guide or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of    1.67495327387791
speed. Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right".   1.6432600607208703
Mrs& Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and    1.6065767145351917
stated, "Have fun! And may you all continue to show at Westminster    1.6432600607208703
in the years to come"!    1.1606783668269585
The    1.0
second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of the Dog Writers    1.5636360329510388
Ass'n of America.   Mr& Barcus spoke on the subject of    1.5636360329510388
scholarships for Juniors- with which he is very familiar. Last year    1.6065767145351917
a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing    1.6432600607208703
Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000. He gave a resume of    1.6065767145351917
the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.   1.7026049541338664
"Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and    1.4513752902486308
should be earnestly encouraged"! is one of Mr& Barcus' strong    1.5636360329510388
beliefs. He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should    1.6065767145351917
take a MORE ACTIVE part in encouraging the Junior Division!   1.5636360329510388
In closing, Mr& Barcus also wished all the Juniors    1.5127085093302464
luck in their Class.    1.0
Instead of 3 a&m&    1.0
in the past, the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45    1.6432600607208703
p&m&. This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the    1.67495327387791
show- a great advantage to them!   Before the Juniors entered    1.5636360329510388
the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved    1.6065767145351917
their dogs around the ring and set them up, they could relax with their    1.7026049541338664
dogs. From there on, each Junior was going to be judged individually.    1.6432600607208703
This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the    1.6065767145351917
Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour,    1.67495327387791
45 minutes to judge the Class.    1.2818970554302986
This year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged the    1.5127085093302464
Class. This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at    1.67495327387791
Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.   As the    1.6065767145351917
Juniors entered the ring, Mr& Spring, the announcer, stated over    1.5636360329510388
the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster    1.6065767145351917
has held the Finals of the Junior Competition. Juniors competed    1.5636360329510388
last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club recognized    1.6065767145351917
shows to be eligible to compete in this Class- the Finals    1.6065767145351917
for the year. A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class    1.7269387314284994
was eligible.   (The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition    1.5127085093302464
is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen. Many    1.6065767145351917
adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class.)   1.5636360329510388
It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select    1.6065767145351917
4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered. A large number of these Juniors    1.67495327387791
have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.   1.6432600607208703
After the judge moved all the dogs individually, she selected    1.5636360329510388
several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring. She    1.7026049541338664
then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship.    1.6432600607208703
BETTY LOU HAM,    1.0
age    1.0
16, Holyoke, Mass&, showing an Irish Setter, was chosen as International    1.6065767145351917
Champion of the year. She was awarded the Professional Handlers'    1.5636360329510388
Ass'ns' LEONARD BRUMBY, SR& Memorial Trophy    1.2818970554302986
(named for the FOUNDER-ORIGINATOR of the Junior Classes.)   1.4513752902486308
Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit    1.67495327387791
last year. In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year,    1.6432600607208703
she also scored with an Afghan.    1.2818970554302986
SYDNEY LE    1.0
BLANC, age 15, Staten Island, N&Y&, showing a Doberman Pinscher,    1.5636360329510388
was 2nd.   SUSAN HACKMANN, age 14, from Baltimore,    1.4513752902486308
Md&, showing a Dachshund, was 3rd. Last year Susan also placed    1.6065767145351917
3rd in the Finals at Westminster. From the records we keep-    1.6065767145351917
Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in    1.67495327387791
both United States and Canada.   KAREN MARCMANN, age 16,    1.5127085093302464
Trapp, Penna&, showing a Keeshond was 4th.   Most Juniors    1.5127085093302464
who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only    1.6432600607208703
show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as    1.67495327387791
well.    1.0
In 1960, there    1.0
were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes. Each year these shows have    1.6432600607208703
increased in entries. Next year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show    1.6065767145351917
Committee has raised the requirements so that a JUNIOR MUST WIN    1.6065767145351917
3 OR MORE JUNIOR CLASSES IN THE OPEN DIVISION ONLY TO QUALIFY FOR WESTMINSTER.   1.7026049541338664
PERCY ROBERTS, a leading judge will not be    1.4513752902486308
at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest    1.6065767145351917
as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March.    1.6065767145351917
It has been suggested many times    1.2818970554302986
that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter    1.7269387314284994
the Junior Classes. For some time this writer has been suggesting    1.6065767145351917
a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years    1.6432600607208703
of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class.   1.6065767145351917
Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester ~KC    1.6065767145351917
Show recently. Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class,    1.6065767145351917
but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day. The Intermediates    1.67495327387791
in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners    1.6432600607208703
and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice    1.6432600607208703
of the Judge.   We suggested this Class in the horse world and    1.6432600607208703
it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows    1.6432600607208703
At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated    1.6432600607208703
that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success    1.5636360329510388
and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world.    1.67495327387791
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given    1.7269387314284994
a chance. Last year Robert Harris, a leading Junior Handler entered    1.6065767145351917
the Dog Judging Contest (Junior) at the International ~KC    1.5127085093302464
of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior    1.67495327387791
since the Class' inception. Juniors who attend this Chicago show    1.5636360329510388
should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help    1.7269387314284994
to them.    1.0
Superintendents    1.0
at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed    1.67495327387791
Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition. The founder of    1.5127085093302464
the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr&    1.5127085093302464
(for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster) was an outstanding    1.6432600607208703
Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit    1.6065767145351917
in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.   1.5636360329510388
Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew    1.6065767145351917
nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog. To    1.7026049541338664
overcome this unfair judging, the A&K&C& requires that a licensed    1.5636360329510388
Handler be present to judge the Class. If the superintendents    1.5636360329510388
do not receive more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested    1.6065767145351917
that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class. By recognizing    1.6432600607208703
and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world, all will    1.6065767145351917
be helping to create future dog owners.    1.3761581156320553
The Airedale    1.0
Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier    1.5127085093302464
Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to    1.5127085093302464
the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition    1.67495327387791
at any Show. The Kansas City and the Topeka ~KCs    1.5636360329510388
are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to    1.67495327387791
win points for Westminster. The Rio Grande ~KC is also considering    1.6065767145351917
having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify    1.6065767145351917
with points for Westminster.   The American Pointer Club    1.4513752902486308
is still continuing to donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior    1.67495327387791
Showmanship Classes with Pointers.   1.0
Traveling through the South- over 16,000 miles- with two    1.5127085093302464
Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten, we've worked up a    1.6432600607208703
regular routine for acceptance at motels.   My husband enters the    1.5636360329510388
motel office, signs up for a room, and them solemnly asks the proprieter    1.67495327387791
if he accepts pets. "Puppies"? comes the suspicious question.    1.5127085093302464
"No", he replies, "full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken,    1.5127085093302464
and obedience-trained".   We've never been refused!   1.2818970554302986
Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way    1.7026049541338664
spot, keep them under control in the room, and feed and bench them where    1.7026049541338664
they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.   1.6065767145351917
In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin!   1.67495327387791
Many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again- has remembered    1.6065767145351917
us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.   1.6065767145351917
So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the    1.6432600607208703
table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination.    1.67495327387791
Is it that they don't care? Are they indifferent to the    1.6065767145351917
fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?   1.67495327387791
AT ONE TIME, to most Americans, unless they were fortunate    1.5636360329510388
enough to live near a body of navigable water, boats were considered    1.6432600607208703
the sole concern of fishermen, rich people, and the United States    1.6065767145351917
Navy.   Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening    1.5636360329510388
statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport. There    1.5636360329510388
are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States    1.6432600607208703
with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade.    1.5636360329510388
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960. Boating has    1.5636360329510388
become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining    1.67495327387791
sea. Boats are operated in every state in the Union, with the heaviest    1.67495327387791
concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West.   1.5127085093302464
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident,    1.5127085093302464
expectedly, in the areas where boats have always been found: the natural    1.6432600607208703
lakes, rivers, and along the nation's coastline. But during the    1.5636360329510388
last several years boats were launched in areas where, a short time    1.6432600607208703
ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for    1.7026049541338664
livestock.   Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources    1.5127085093302464
control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies of water represent    1.6065767145351917
a kind of glorious fringe benefit, providing boating and fishing    1.5636360329510388
havens all over the country.   No matter how determined or wealthy    1.6065767145351917
boating lovers of the Southwest had been, for example, they could    1.6065767145351917
never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake    1.5127085093302464
Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which resulted when the    1.5636360329510388
Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River. In 1959, according    1.6065767145351917
to the Engineers, Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial    1.6065767145351917
lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000    1.6065767145351917
persons.   Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been    1.5636360329510388
created by bringing bodies of water to the people, means have been found    1.67495327387791
to take the people and their boats to the water. Providing these    1.6432600607208703
means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000    1.5636360329510388
boat trailers now in use. It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty    1.7269387314284994
or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new, light, strong,    1.7026049541338664
easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any    1.5127085093302464
kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000. The sight of    1.67495327387791
sleek    1.0
inboards, outboards, and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways    1.5127085093302464
many miles from any water is commonplace.   Boatmen lucky enough    1.5636360329510388
to have facilities for year 'round anchorage for their craft,    1.5636360329510388
will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car,    1.6432600607208703
driving to the water,    1.0
and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to    1.5636360329510388
the boat. Today, the boat, on its trailer, is brought to the gear and    1.7026049541338664
loaded at the door. Arriving at the waterside, the boat is launched,    1.6432600607208703
the family taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is begun.   1.6432600607208703
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be    1.6432600607208703
ten years ago. This year, Americans will discover previously unheard    1.5636360329510388
of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred    1.6432600607208703
of our nation's national, regional and local boat shows. The boats    1.6065767145351917
of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as    1.6432600607208703
they are hauled to new horizons.   The variety of craft on the    1.6432600607208703
country's waters today is overwhelming. They range from an eight-foot    1.5636360329510388
pram, which you can build yourself for less than $50, to auxiliary    1.6432600607208703
sailboats which can cost over $100,000. Boat prices vary according to    1.6065767145351917
the buyer's desires or needs. In this respect, boats can be compared    1.6432600607208703
with houses. There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is easily    1.7269387314284994
possible to keep within a set budget. There is no question as to    1.67495327387791
just what is available. You name it, our industry is producing it, and    1.67495327387791
it probably is made in different models.   There are canoes ideal    1.6065767145351917
for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips. There are    1.6065767145351917
houseboats which are literally homes afloat, accommodating whole families    1.5127085093302464
in comfort and convenience. You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped    1.67495327387791
craft, sail, power, or both, or laze away a fine day in a small    1.7026049541338664
dinghy on a local pond.   You may have your boat of wood, canvas,    1.67495327387791
plywood, plastic, or metal. You may order utility models, inboard or    1.6065767145351917
outboard, with or without toilets, galleys, and bunks. You may dress    1.6065767145351917
it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.   1.7269387314284994
Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers    1.4513752902486308
who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena    1.6432600607208703
lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month    1.67495327387791
ride around the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on all    1.6432600607208703
the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.    1.67495327387791
You pay your money and you take your choice.   American technology    1.6065767145351917
in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful    1.6065767145351917
interest in American boating. I wonder if anyone ever bothered    1.5636360329510388
to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors, Americans    1.7026049541338664
excel over any country in the world in the long run.   Russia,    1.6432600607208703
whose technology is not quite primitive, is still in the dark ages    1.6432600607208703
when it comes to improving the outboard motor, for instance.   Now    1.6065767145351917
here is truly a marvel. The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal    1.67495327387791
range of one to 80 horsepower, unheard of a few years ago for a two    1.7269387314284994
cycle engine in quantity production. These engines can be removed    1.5636360329510388
from a boat with relative ease, wherein lies their greatest advantage.    1.6065767145351917
Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook, the    1.6432600607208703
range being about $150 to $1,000, depending on size.   Great    1.5636360329510388
thought    1.0
has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population    1.6432600607208703
of the country; and to making the owning of a boat simpler. There    1.67495327387791
was a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it was necessary    1.7269387314284994
for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he    1.7026049541338664
could touch the tiller or wheel. Having a boat financed through a local    1.67495327387791
bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended.    1.67495327387791
Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer    1.6065767145351917
areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.   1.6065767145351917
Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down    1.67495327387791
payments run about the same as for automobiles. Of course, individual    1.6065767145351917
financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning    1.5636360329510388
power, credit rating and local bank policy.   Outboard motors,    1.5127085093302464
insurance, and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as    1.67495327387791
boats. Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those    1.6065767145351917
for home appliances.   When the automobile was in its embryonic    1.5636360329510388
stage, such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit    1.67495327387791
understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about    1.5636360329510388
the only rule governing where, when and how fast a car could go. When    1.7026049541338664
air travel was in its infancy, the sky was considered big enough and    1.67495327387791
high enough for all. Man had enough to worry about managing to get    1.67495327387791
up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft. It was    1.67495327387791
much the same with pleasure boating at first. Come one, come all, the    1.67495327387791
water's fine!   As the ungoverned days of the automobile    1.5127085093302464
and the airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is the carefree    1.7026049541338664
attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do; must and should    1.67495327387791
do. However, there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.   1.6065767145351917
Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the    1.6065767145351917
craft is to be used and according to its horsepower. What may be acceptable    1.7026049541338664
in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line.    1.6065767145351917
The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according    1.6432600607208703
to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally    1.67495327387791
used. If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure    1.6432600607208703
boats, you must apply for a number from the U&S& Coast Guard for    1.67495327387791
any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower    1.67495327387791
before it can be used on Federal waterways.   State numbering    1.5636360329510388
laws differ from each other in many ways. Fees are not the    1.6432600607208703
same    1.0
and some states do not require certain craft, such as sailboats with    1.6432600607208703
no power, to be registered at all. Many states have laws regulating    1.6432600607208703
the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age    1.6432600607208703
of motor boat operators.   Generally, states reserve for communities    1.5127085093302464
the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities.    1.6065767145351917
It is always wise to consult your marine dealer, local yacht    1.6065767145351917
or boat club secretary, or local law enforcement officers if you are    1.6432600607208703
not positive what the regulations are. Ignorance of the law is no better    1.67495327387791
excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability and common    1.7026049541338664
sense can lead to just as much tragedy.   Hand in hand with    1.6432600607208703
the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed    1.5636360329510388
safety program. Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the    1.5636360329510388
rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting an intense,    1.6432600607208703
coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.   1.4513752902486308
A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the    1.67495327387791
enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers. The industry    1.4513752902486308
has been its own watch dog. With U&S& Coast Guard cooperation,    1.6065767145351917
the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended    1.6065767145351917
practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference    1.5636360329510388
to safety.   Industry interest in safety goes even farther.    1.5127085093302464
In 1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National    1.6065767145351917
Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance    1.6065767145351917
underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service    1.5127085093302464
for boats and their equipment. A new waterfront site for the bureau    1.6432600607208703
is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to provide the    1.6432600607208703
most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the    1.6432600607208703
sport safe.   In addition to these activities, the ~NAEBM,    1.5127085093302464
with headquarters at 420 lexington Avenue, New York City, as well    1.6065767145351917
as other associations and individual manufacturers, provide and distribute    1.5127085093302464
films, booklets, and public services in regard to proper boat handling    1.6065767145351917
and safety afloat.   It is important to note the work of    1.6065767145351917
the United States Power Squadrons and the U&S& Coast Guard    1.5636360329510388
Auxiliary. Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in    1.6065767145351917
seamanship piloting and small boat handling. These are not governmentally    1.5636360329510388
subsidized organizations. This year, over 100,000 persons will    1.4513752902486308
receive this free instruction.   As America on wheels was responsible    1.5636360329510388
for an industry of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments    1.5636360329510388
where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank deposit,    1.67495327387791
the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries    1.5127085093302464
designed especially to accommodate them. Instead of motels, for    1.5127085093302464
the boatman there are marinas.   The word marina was coined by    1.6065767145351917
~NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational    1.5127085093302464
boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative    1.6432600607208703
comfort. Currently, marina is used to indicate a municipal or    1.5636360329510388
commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome    1.6065767145351917
or all of the following available: gasoline, fresh water, electricity,    1.5636360329510388
telephone service, ice, repair facilities, restaurants, sleeping    1.3761581156320553
accommodations, a general store, and a grocery store.   Yachtel,    1.5127085093302464
a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront type of hotel where    1.6065767145351917
a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises    1.6065767145351917
as well as other services. Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.    1.6432600607208703
It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically    1.67495327387791
to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as    1.6065767145351917
outboards. Regardless of nomenclature, yachtels and boatels are marinas.   1.5127085093302464
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities    1.5127085093302464
may rightfully be called marinas.   A recent survey disclosed there    1.5636360329510388
are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and    1.5127085093302464
boatyards in the United States, the majority of which are equipped    1.6065767145351917
to handle outboard boats.    1.0
THE design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical    1.6432600607208703
puzzle, but once understood, the principles can be applied to    1.5636360329510388
any track and signal arrangement. In the frame are two sets of bars    1.67495327387791
which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous    1.6432600607208703
moves. The main set of bars are the "tappets" and one tappet    1.6432600607208703
is connected to each lever. If the lever is pulled to clear a signal    1.7026049541338664
or move a switch, the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at    1.6432600607208703
the same time.   Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking    1.67495327387791
bars. These can also move a short distance but at right angles    1.6432600607208703
to the tappets. The number of locking bars required depends on how many    1.67495327387791
false moves must be prevented.   In the sides of the tappets    1.6065767145351917
are notches with sloping sides, and connection between the tappets and    1.6065767145351917
locking bars consist of cams called "dogs". Two or more dogs are    1.6432600607208703
mounted on each locking bar. These slide into and out of the notches    1.67495327387791
in the tappets as the tappets are moved, locking and unlocking them.   1.6432600607208703
Here's how the scheme works: Suppose the operator pulls    1.5127085093302464
the lever to clear a particular signal. This also pulls the tappet connected    1.67495327387791
to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches    1.6432600607208703
to the side, thus moving one or more locking bars. The dogs on the    1.7026049541338664
other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other    1.67495327387791
tappets. By this scheme, pulling one signal to clear locks all the    1.6432600607208703
other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal    1.6432600607208703
is again restored to normal.   Interlocking signals are normally    1.5127085093302464
at stop or "red" position, and a lever must be pulled to "clear"    1.67495327387791
the signal. This is not necessarily to green, however, for in    1.6065767145351917
some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it    1.7026049541338664
into the "plant".   There are other basic rules. A turnout    1.5636360329510388
may have two levers, one to actually move the switch points, the other    1.67495327387791
to lock the points. A signal cannot be cleared until all the related    1.67495327387791
turnouts are properly thrown <and> locked. Such locks are nearly    1.5636360329510388
always used where the switch points "face" oncoming traffic. The    1.5636360329510388
lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that    1.7026049541338664
a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point. If the points aren't    1.7026049541338664
thrown all the way, the turnout cannot be locked, and in turn,    1.6432600607208703
the signal cannot be cleared. Generally, these locks on turnouts are    1.6065767145351917
called "facing point locks".   Figs& 1-6 show typical arrangements    1.5127085093302464
of track and signals. Each diagram is accompanied by a "dog    1.6065767145351917
chart", a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular    1.67495327387791
lever will lock if pulled. The lines connecting the wedge-shaped    1.5636360329510388
dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.   1.6432600607208703
By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several    1.4513752902486308
other details. Derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide    1.5127085093302464
the wheels off the rails if a train passes a "stop" signal- are    1.67495327387791
used in many instances. "Home" signals have two blades. The blacked-in    1.6065767145351917
blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move. As    1.6065767145351917
an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal    1.6065767145351917
is seen in advance when he passes the "distant" signal located    1.6065767145351917
beyond the limits of the interlocking plant. In some low-speed situations,    1.6065767145351917
the distant signal is fixed at caution. In other instances where    1.6065767145351917
there is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only green    1.6065767145351917
and yellow aspects.   So much for the prototype.   The interlocking    1.5636360329510388
frame we built at the MODEL RAILROADER workshop and then    1.5636360329510388
installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig& 1 scheme    1.5636360329510388
and is shown beginning in Fig& 7, page 65, and in the photos. Here's    1.7026049541338664
how it can be built.    1.1606783668269585
The sizes of pieces needed    1.1606783668269585
for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig& 7, most    1.67495327387791
of the bars being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths.    1.6065767145351917
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers    1.7026049541338664
and locks as you wish. Our instructions assume you are building    1.6065767145351917
this particular frame, which is for a junction.   When cutting    1.5636360329510388
the pieces, dress the ends smooth, and square with a smooth file or sanding    1.7026049541338664
disk. Start with the right-hand piece "~B", **f, soldering    1.5127085093302464
it to the lower piece "~A" of the same material but 12''    1.6432600607208703
long. Let exactly 1'' of "~A" extend beyond "~B" and    1.5636360329510388
use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.   Now    1.6432600607208703
lay 12 pieces of **f cut 5-3/4'' long side by side but separated    1.67495327387791
by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' sq&. This gives you the    1.67495327387791
spacing for locating the left-hand piece "~B". Compress the assembly    1.5636360329510388
when you make the mark to show the location for "~B". Solder    1.6432600607208703
this second "~B" to "~A" at right angles. There    1.5127085093302464
should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be    1.6432600607208703
1'' from an end of the long piece.   Cap this assembly (with    1.6432600607208703
spacing bars in place) with a **f bar. Tack-solder all the 1/2''    1.6432600607208703
sq& pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members. These will be drilled    1.6432600607208703
and tapped later on.   Now cut five **f locking bar spacers    1.6065767145351917
(which run horizontally). Position these using six intermediate temporary    1.5127085093302464
**f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar "~A". Solder    1.5636360329510388
it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame. Now place 12 pieces    1.7026049541338664
1/2'' sq& on this edge as we did before and space them with    1.67495327387791
the 5-3/4'' long "tappets", as they are called. Cap with a **f    1.6432600607208703
bar and tack-solder in place. Cap the locking bar spacers with two    1.6432600607208703
**f directly under the first two "~B" pieces. Remove all the    1.6065767145351917
loose spacing bars.   Mark and center-punch all the holes required    1.5636360329510388
for screws to hold this assembly together. See Fig& 7. Placement    1.6065767145351917
of these holes is not critical, but they should be located so that    1.67495327387791
the centers are about 1/8'' from any edge. Drill all No& 50 and    1.67495327387791
counter-drill all except the "~A" pieces size 43. Tap the "~A"    1.6065767145351917
pieces 2-56.   Now unsolder and disassemble the frame    1.4513752902486308
except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ("~A"    1.6432600607208703
and "~B" pieces), which are soldered together. Either lay    1.5127085093302464
the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters    1.67495327387791
so they may be replaced in their proper positions. Dress all surfaces    1.6432600607208703
with a file, cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.   1.5636360329510388
Drill 20 No& 47 holes in the upper piece "~A" as shown in    1.67495327387791
Fig& 7. Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later    1.6065767145351917
on. Note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.   1.6432600607208703
Now reassemble the frame, using **f roundhead steel screws and nuts.    1.6065767145351917
Put the 12 tappets and some **f locking bar spacers in the frame to    1.7026049541338664
help align all the components before you tighten the screws. Be sure    1.6432600607208703
the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq& spacer. As    1.6432600607208703
an anchor for the spring lock, insert a **f bar in the lower left corner    1.7269387314284994
of the frame as shown in Fig& 7. Drill a No& 43 hole through    1.7026049541338664
the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw. Drill two No& 50    1.7026049541338664
holes, one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly    1.67495327387791
above it, and tap 2-56. Number all the tappet bars before removing them    1.67495327387791
so they can be replaced in the same slots. Remove all other loose    1.67495327387791
pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth. Cut five pieces    1.67495327387791
of **f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long. These are supporting members    1.6065767145351917
for the short locking bars. Locate their positions in Fig& 7 and    1.6432600607208703
drill No& 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame. Cut off    1.67495327387791
excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut. Drill    1.6432600607208703
four No& 19 and four No& 28 holes in the 12'' long "~A"    1.67495327387791
pieces. Locate the position from Fig& 7.    1.3761581156320553
Draw-file No& 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective    1.6065767145351917
slot and square the ends. Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree    1.7026049541338664
chamfer. Drill a No& 50 hole 1-1/4'' from one end and tap    1.6432600607208703
2-56. (See Fig& 7.) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole, cut    1.67495327387791
off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar.    1.67495327387791
To find the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into the frame    1.67495327387791
and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge. Scribe a line    1.67495327387791
across the bar on the other end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the    1.7026049541338664
diameter of the 2-56 screw head (about 5/64'') away from the frame    1.6432600607208703
edge. Total distance is about 21/64''. Tend to make this dimension    1.6065767145351917
slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly    1.6432600607208703
1/4'' tappet movement. Drill a No& 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert    1.6432600607208703
a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end. Drill a No&    1.7026049541338664
47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in    1.6065767145351917
Figs&    1.0
7 and 8. Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet    1.7026049541338664
bars.   To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a **f piece of    1.67495327387791
brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs& 6 and 8. These    1.7026049541338664
will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.   Fitting    1.5636360329510388
the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job    1.67495327387791
since stop screws, tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced    1.6432600607208703
many times. As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become    1.6432600607208703
a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before    1.6432600607208703
the part you are working on is accessible. A little extra work    1.6432600607208703
here will pay off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are finished.    1.67495327387791
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work    1.6065767145351917
progresses to insure snug fitting.   The order of fitting is not    1.6065767145351917
too important. However, we started with the first row of bars and worked    1.67495327387791
our way back. Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs    1.67495327387791
and notches is used throughout, we will only describe the construction    1.6065767145351917
of one locking bar. Figs& 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions.    1.6432600607208703
All the bars are cut from **f brass. The lengths of each piece are    1.7026049541338664
listed at the bottom of Fig& 7. Bar "~C" is 2-3/4'' long.    1.6432600607208703
Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put a slight chamfer    1.6432600607208703
on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.   Fig& 8 gives    1.7026049541338664
the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes. Center-punch and drill    1.5636360329510388
the No& 31 hole 7/16'' from one end of the bar. Chuck a length    1.7026049541338664
of 1/8'' dia& drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning    1.67495327387791
device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file    1.67495327387791
a slight taper 1/8'' long. Cut the piece about 9/32'' or 5/16''    1.6432600607208703
long and drive it into the No& 31 hole drilled in the locking    1.67495327387791
bar. File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8''    1.67495327387791
above the bar. This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.   1.7269387314284994
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3.    1.6065767145351917
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of    1.7026049541338664
tappet 3, parallel to piece "~A". See the drawings for the shape    1.6432600607208703
of the notch. Scribe ~V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out    1.6432600607208703
with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool. We used    1.748515906000203
the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .020'' thick and    1.6065767145351917
1'' dia& fitted on a 1/8'' dia& mandrel. Such disks are    1.6065767145351917
very handy for cutting and shaping small parts. File to a smooth finish.    1.67495327387791
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular    1.5636360329510388
shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without    1.7026049541338664
marring an adjoining one. Endeavor to get the notches as much alike    1.6432600607208703
as possible. The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel    1.67495327387791
dog will slide easily over it. Assemble the parts in the frame and    1.67495327387791
test the sliding action of the mating pieces. All matching surfaces    1.6065767145351917
should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis.    1.6432600607208703
Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia& drill rod in a    1.67495327387791
drill press or    1.0
electric hand tool. Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64''    1.5636360329510388
long on one end, using Swiss pattern files. This tool can also be    1.67495327387791
made with a lathe.   1.0
Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on    1.6432600607208703
mathematics. Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes    1.6065767145351917
of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round    1.7026049541338664
would not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and communicating    1.5636360329510388
the things they discover and learn. Math and the formulas that    1.6065767145351917
allow it to be applied to different problems are, therefore, essential    1.6065767145351917
to any scientific endeavor.   Hot rodding is a science. It's    1.5636360329510388
not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate    1.6432600607208703
on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit    1.67495327387791
but it is, nevertheless, a science. But because science is based on mathematics    1.67495327387791
doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.    1.6065767145351917
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years    1.6432600607208703
without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems;    1.4513752902486308
however, he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and    1.67495327387791
the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few    1.67495327387791
formulas that apply to rodding.   A mathematical formula is nothing    1.5636360329510388
more than a pattern for solving a specific problem. It places the    1.6432600607208703
various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation    1.6432600607208703
to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can    1.67495327387791
be computed.   The first step in using a formula is to insert the    1.67495327387791
numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions    1.5636360329510388
in the formula. This changes the formula to an "equation". The    1.6065767145351917
equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.   1.6065767145351917
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated. They involve    1.5127085093302464
only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic    1.5636360329510388
classes. However, it is essential that the various mathematical symbols    1.5636360329510388
used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes    1.6065767145351917
can be done properly and in their correct order. They indicate    1.6065767145351917
simple division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.   The    1.3761581156320553
symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers    1.6065767145351917
placed one above the other. The lower number is always divided into the    1.67495327387791
upper number: **f   The symbol for multiplication is "~@".    1.4513752902486308
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row. For example:    1.7026049541338664
**f Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any    1.6065767145351917
order. The result will be the same regardless of the order used.   1.6432600607208703
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign. This is    1.6065767145351917
nothing more than a dash. It separates two or more numbers. The number    1.67495327387791
on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on    1.67495327387791
the left of the symbol. For example: **f When more than two figures    1.67495327387791
are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried    1.5636360329510388
out from the left to right if the result is to be correct. For example,    1.7269387314284994
for the problem **f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals    1.7026049541338664
9.   Addition is indicated by the ~+ symbol. The symbol is    1.5636360329510388
used to separate two or more numbers. For example: **f Numbers separated    1.6432600607208703
by addition symbols may be placed in any order.   When solving    1.6065767145351917
an equation that involves division as well as other steps, do all    1.6432600607208703
the division steps first    1.0
to reduce those parts of the equation to their    1.5127085093302464
numerical value. Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can then    1.4513752902486308
be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left    1.67495327387791
end of the equation and working toward the right. Completing the    1.6065767145351917
division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication,    1.5636360329510388
subtraction, or addition steps: **f This would be reduced    1.5127085093302464
by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12. This part    1.7026049541338664
of the equation would then become 4.   For use in formulas, fractions    1.6432600607208703
should be converted to their decimal equivalents. The easiest    1.5127085093302464
way to do this is with a conversion chart. Charts for this purpose    1.67495327387791
are available from many sources. They are included in all types of mathematical    1.67495327387791
handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision    1.5636360329510388
measuring instruments.   The various mathematical processes can    1.3761581156320553
be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.    1.67495327387791
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental    1.6065767145351917
effect on the accuracy of the final result.   Some formulas    1.5636360329510388
contain "constants". A constant is a number that remains the same    1.6065767145351917
regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant    1.6432600607208703
equation. It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved    1.6432600607208703
correctly.   Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.    1.5636360329510388
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases    1.6432600607208703
and,    1.0
quite often, are necessary for completing entry blanks for different    1.5636360329510388
events. When it is needed, one formula is as important as another.    1.6432600607208703
However, some formulas are used more than others. We'll take    1.5636360329510388
them in the general order of their popularity.    1.4513752902486308
A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.    1.6432600607208703
Displacement is sometimes referred to as "swept volume". Most    1.5127085093302464
entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information    1.5127085093302464
because of class restrictions. It is good to be able to compute    1.6432600607208703
displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking    1.6065767145351917
can be computed.   Factors involved in the displacement formula    1.5127085093302464
are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length of the    1.6432600607208703
piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the engine, and a constant.    1.6432600607208703
The constant is .7854, which is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant    1.6065767145351917
known as "pi". Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions    1.6432600607208703
of circles.   Actually, the engine displacement formula is    1.4513752902486308
the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type    1.67495327387791
with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the    1.6432600607208703
engine. The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and    1.5636360329510388
then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying    1.6065767145351917
the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent of the length    1.67495327387791
of the cylinders. Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders    1.6065767145351917
in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.   The formula    1.5636360329510388
is: **f. Dimensions in inches, and fractions of inches will give    1.6065767145351917
the displacement in cubic inches. Dimensions in centimeters and fractions    1.5636360329510388
of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters    1.5127085093302464
(~cc). One inch equals 2.54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16.38    1.6065767145351917
cubic centimeters.   For example, let's consider a standard    1.4513752902486308
283 cubic inch Chevy ~V8. These engines have a cylinder diameter    1.6065767145351917
of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches. The formula, with    1.67495327387791
the fractions converted to decimals, becomes **f.   To arrive    1.5127085093302464
at the answer, multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of    1.67495327387791
the group and working to the right. The different steps will look like    1.67495327387791
this: **f    1.0
A cylinder's compression ratio    1.0
is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume, or its displacement,    1.5636360329510388
with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.    1.6065767145351917
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber    1.5127085093302464
volume must be measured with a liquid.   Cylinder volume is    1.5636360329510388
determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula:    1.6065767145351917
**f.   To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers    1.6065767145351917
in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark plug in the chamber    1.67495327387791
and support the head so that its gasket surface is level. Then pour    1.67495327387791
water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill    1.67495327387791
the chamber to its gasket surface. Do not overfill the chamber. This    1.6432600607208703
is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension.    1.67495327387791
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface    1.6065767145351917
around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.   1.6065767145351917
The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting    1.6432600607208703
the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from    1.6432600607208703
the original quantity. Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters    1.5636360329510388
(~cc), making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches.    1.6065767145351917
However, the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic    1.6065767145351917
centimeters. The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will    1.5636360329510388
be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are    1.6432600607208703
used. The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be    1.67495327387791
quoted in the same terms.   The volume of the cylinder opening    1.6065767145351917
in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square    1.67495327387791
inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch. Sometimes    1.6065767145351917
it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening    1.67495327387791
but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy    1.5636360329510388
that it won't affect the final computation. The volume of the opening    1.6432600607208703
is added to the combustion chamber volume.   Another thing    1.5127085093302464
that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between    1.67495327387791
the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston    1.7269387314284994
is in top dead center position. Compute this volume by measuring    1.6065767145351917
the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately    1.7026049541338664
as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring    1.6065767145351917
device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth. The    1.67495327387791
formula for this step is: **f This volume is added to the total volume    1.7026049541338664
of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening. The total of    1.6065767145351917
these three volumes is the "final combustion chamber volume".   1.5127085093302464
After the factors just described have been computed, they are applied    1.6065767145351917
to the following formula: **f   For an example let's dream    1.5636360329510388
up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic    1.67495327387791
inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches. Applying these figures    1.6432600607208703
to the formula we get the equation: **f The compression ratio is    1.6432600607208703
10 to 1.   This method of computing compression ratio cannot be    1.6065767145351917
used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly    1.6432600607208703
shaped heads. Any irregularity on the piston heads will make    1.5636360329510388
it impossible, with normal means, to determine the final combustion    1.5636360329510388
chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot    1.6065767145351917
be readily computed. The only way to determine the final combustion    1.6065767145351917
chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid    1.67495327387791
while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston    1.67495327387791
is in top dead center position.    1.2818970554302986
There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships    1.6065767145351917
of car speed, engine speed, rear axle gear ratio, and rear tire    1.6432600607208703
size. By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can    1.6432600607208703
be determined for any combination of the other three.   To simplify    1.6065767145351917
the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of    1.5636360329510388
the factors. These are   ~MPH for Car speed   ~RPM    1.5127085093302464
for Engine crankshaft speed   ~R for Rear axle gear ratio   1.5636360329510388
~W for Tire size   Tire size can be determined in    1.5636360329510388
several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is    1.7269387314284994
by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly. This    1.6432600607208703
is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire    1.67495327387791
is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft. A tire must be inflated    1.7269387314284994
to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to    1.67495327387791
its operating weight when this measurement is made. The measurement    1.5636360329510388
must be in inches. Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement    1.67495327387791
must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.    1.6065767145351917
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used    1.7026049541338664
in the formula.   To determine car speed for a given combination    1.6065767145351917
of engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula is: **f    1.6432600607208703
For an engine speed of 5000 ~rpm, a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1, and a    1.748515906000203
tire radius of 13 inches, the equation would look like this: **f   1.6432600607208703
To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three    1.6432600607208703
factors the formula is: **f Using the same figures as for the    1.6432600607208703
previous example, the equation becomes: **f   To determine the    1.5127085093302464
rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors, the    1.67495327387791
formula is: **f Using the figures from the previous examples, the    1.6065767145351917
equation becomes: **f    1.0
to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner (Mainliner-Highland    1.67495327387791
Ellen), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was    1.5636360329510388
clocked 2:25. She is owned by Ralph H& Kroening, Milwaukee,    1.5636360329510388
Wis&, who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly proud of her.   1.6432600607208703
Other good miles have been by Debonnie (Dale Frost-Debby    1.5127085093302464
Hanover) and Prompt Time (Adios-On Time) in 2:28-:36;    1.4513752902486308
Kimberly Gal (Galophone-Kimberly Hanover) 2:26.2; Laguerre    1.2818970554302986
Hanover    1.0
(Tar Heel- Lotus Hanover) and Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd)    1.5127085093302464
in 2:34~h. Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation-    1.5636360329510388
good body, plenty of heart girth, stands straight on his legs    1.6065767145351917
on excellent feet- and has the smoothest gait. This colt is behind    1.6432600607208703
most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show    1.6432600607208703
about as much pace as any of them. Monel shows improvement with each    1.67495327387791
work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her    1.67495327387791
share of races.   Stardel (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover),    1.3761581156320553
2:34~h, looks quite promising. Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay),    1.4513752902486308
Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover) and Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess    1.4513752902486308
Hanover) have been working together but have not equalled their best    1.6065767145351917
work done some weeks ago. Fury and Caper worked in 2:35~h and did    1.67495327387791
it with ease. They are two good colts of different type. Fury is    1.67495327387791
upstanding and on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type.    1.67495327387791
I have never seen Caper off his feet- he seems to know nothing but    1.7026049541338664
'trot' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so. Fury    1.67495327387791
has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect, with his    1.67495327387791
impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.   1.6065767145351917
Trackdown (Torrid-Mighty Lady) has worked a mile in 2:33.3~h.    1.5127085093302464
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace. Then, after    1.6432600607208703
emasculation, he was eased up for a couple of weeks. He has thrived    1.67495327387791
on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race    1.7269387314284994
horse.   Thor Hanover (Adios-Trustful Hanover) is a wonderful    1.4513752902486308
looking prospect and another good individual, with solid, rugged conformation,    1.5636360329510388
good, flat bone and excellent feet. This colt arrived at    1.5636360329510388
the Raceway early last November, and immediately was put into harness    1.6065767145351917
and line-driven for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in    1.7026049541338664
very nicely, knowing nothing but trot. He appeared in the hopples about    1.6432600607208703
November 14, was treated for worms on the 18th, the latter date being    1.67495327387791
the first time he struck a real pace. On December 5 he paced a mile    1.7269387314284994
in 2:55 on the twice-around, out in third position all the way.    1.6432600607208703
This colt has done everything asked of him, and done it with ease. His    1.7026049541338664
best mile to date is 2:32.2~h.   Gamecock (Tar Heel-Terka    1.5127085093302464
Hanover) is another promising colt, and his best time is 2:32.2~h.    1.6065767145351917
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center.    1.6432600607208703
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare;    1.67495327387791
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff. The fourth time in    1.7026049541338664
harness he walked off like a gentleman. Being blistered for curbs has    1.6432600607208703
delayed his work somewhat. But up to date he has shown as much as any    1.7269387314284994
in the big Simpson stable.   Hustler (Knight Dream-Torkin)    1.4513752902486308
is a playful bay rascal of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely    1.7269387314284994
can pace and is right there with them, and sometimes leading them, in    1.67495327387791
the best miles. Torrid Freight (Torrid-Breeze On Hal) is a very    1.6065767145351917
rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease    1.6432600607208703
everything asked of him. His best time is around 2:33.   Strongheart    1.6065767145351917
(Adios-Direct Gal), a fair-looking sorrel colt, knows nothing    1.4513752902486308
but pace and has been right there in the best miles. Torrid Adios    1.67495327387791
(Torrid-Adios Molly) is not so masculine as most of the colts,    1.6065767145351917
but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers    1.7026049541338664
on the grounds. Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks, he is    1.67495327387791
coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me. First Flyer (Frisco    1.67495327387791
Flyer-Castle Light) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois    1.5636360329510388
Stakes. His best time is 2:33.2~h.   The colts in Simpson's    1.5636360329510388
stable have little if anything on the fillies, especially the    1.5636360329510388
pacers. Justine Hanover (Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover) is    1.3761581156320553
improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4~h weeks ago.    1.5127085093302464
Mrs& Freight (Knight Dream-Miss Reed) shows promise and does it    1.5636360329510388
in good form, and her best time is about 2:35. Hoopla (Tar Heel-Holiday    1.67495327387791
Hanover), a filly that wanted to trot, knocked herself October    1.5636360329510388
31 and November 1 fighting the hopples. She was then trained on    1.6432600607208703
the trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart once around the    1.67495327387791
half-mile track and hoppled again. This time she submitted and in    1.6065767145351917
a few days was going good. On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1-:38~h;    1.7269387314284994
on Jan& 18 2:37.3-:36.1~h; on Jan& 21, 2:36.    1.4513752902486308
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters,    1.6432600607208703
Valentine Day and Cerise- more scale and much better underpinning.    1.5636360329510388
She is more like her full brother, Taraday Hanover, but    1.5636360329510388
larger. Up to date she is a grand-looking filly.   Pete Dailey    1.6065767145351917
has four promising 2-year-old pacers. Marquis Pick (Gene Abbe-Direct    1.5127085093302464
Grattan) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time.    1.67495327387791
He is a fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs and nice    1.7269387314284994
way of going. His best mile to date is 2:28-:33. Majestic Pick    1.6432600607208703
comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2. This colt is another    1.6065767145351917
fine-looking equine. Staley Hanover (Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover)    1.3761581156320553
is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks    1.7026049541338664
like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his    1.67495327387791
class. Best time to date is 2:34-:34. Step Aside (Direct Rhythm-Wily    1.6065767145351917
Widow) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows    1.6065767145351917
promise.   Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked    1.4513752902486308
from 2:40 to 2:35. Bonnie Wick (Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary) has    1.5636360329510388
gone in 2:36~h; Hickory Ash (Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover)    1.4513752902486308
in 2:35. The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me    1.7026049541338664
and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself, "that    1.67495327387791
must be Hickory Ash". She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot.    1.67495327387791
Hickory Hill (Star's Pride-Venus Hanover) has gone in 2:33~h;    1.5127085093302464
Hickory Spark (Harlan-Hickory Tiny) 2:37~h; Buxton    1.2818970554302986
Hanover (Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover) 2:35; Faber's Kathy    1.3761581156320553
(Faber Hanover-Ceyway) 2:37~h; Honor Rodney (Rodney-Honor    1.2818970554302986
Bright) around 2:40. The last-named is a fine-looking, large colt,    1.5636360329510388
who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries.    1.7026049541338664
He is going sound again now, and looks good.   Brief Candle    1.6065767145351917

of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her very much. I will    1.7269387314284994
be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future.   1.7269387314284994
I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile    1.6065767145351917
in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3. In going away Debonnie got behind    1.6432600607208703
several lengths, stalling at the start- she is a little fussy. They    1.6432600607208703
left the three-quarters together and finished almost together. Prompt    1.5127085093302464
Time shows class. This filly is another Adios that wants to trot,    1.6432600607208703
and trot she did until forced to do otherwise. After well broken    1.6432600607208703
and equipped with 12~oz shoes on behind, bare-footed in front, she    1.6065767145351917
would trot a real storm with the master, Delvin, driving. Being placed    1.6432600607208703
in the hopples she was completely baffled. She hesitated, she hopped,    1.6065767145351917
she roll and rocked, skipped and jumped, but in some two weeks she    1.67495327387791
started to pace, From that time to this she has shown steady improvement    1.67495327387791
and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.   1.6432600607208703
Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there were a few miles    1.6432600607208703
of note on Thursday.    1.0

before long.   Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet (Adios-Rena    1.5636360329510388

with good disposition and good gait, and she has worked up to date in    1.7026049541338664
2:46.    1.0
days, moisture finally came to Del Mar, resulting in but one workout    1.6432600607208703
during the week for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than    1.7026049541338664
half our total average rainfall during the season.   While 2-year-olds    1.5636360329510388
are still gaining most of the attention at the track, green    1.6065767145351917

The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun (we    1.6432600607208703
ran a survey to find out) but he's always on the lookout for new and    1.7269387314284994
better arms. He's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's    1.6065767145351917
a real hunter and shooter, eager to improve his sport. Well, if you're    1.67495327387791
that kind of sportsman we're here to help you. You've probably    1.6065767145351917
given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack,    1.6432600607208703
but it's not easy to decide on a new one. You still have time to    1.7269387314284994
drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time    1.6432600607208703
to decide on them is now. As a Christmas service, I've taken a close    1.7026049541338664
look at this year's crop of new models. Here they are, with my    1.67495327387791
comments and judgments. Read on, take your pick- and start dropping    1.6065767145351917
those hints.   First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle    1.67495327387791
and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.    1.6065767145351917
For me, a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute    1.6432600607208703
a truly new design. Such modifications are all for the best but    1.6432600607208703
it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change    1.67495327387791
arms-making concepts.   Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker    1.2818970554302986
(under $110) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the    1.7026049541338664
modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short, light, quick-handling,    1.5636360329510388
fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug    1.5636360329510388
at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for    1.67495327387791
our most popular big game- whitetail.   Ruger reports that    1.5127085093302464
on his recent African safari the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a    1.6432600607208703
real work horse. Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot,    1.6065767145351917
and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob and wart hog with    1.67495327387791
deadly efficiency; these are fairly large, tough animals.    1.4513752902486308
The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to    1.7026049541338664
me. At least five years ago, Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under    1.7026049541338664
double rifle for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model    1.6432600607208703
90 action in 20-gauge size. After figuring out how to regulate the    1.6432600607208703
barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this    1.7026049541338664
little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground    1.6065767145351917
test gallery. We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill    1.6432600607208703
Ruger in his first experiments: Three or four bullets would be    1.6065767145351917
placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably,    1.6432600607208703
one could stray far out of the group.   Ruger learned that this    1.6432600607208703
was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting    1.6432600607208703
the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet. The new, jacketed slug    1.6065767145351917
in .44 Magnum corrected this. But even without jacketed bullets, I    1.6065767145351917
had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt    1.7026049541338664
that first year. Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that    1.67495327387791
hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind    1.6065767145351917
the left foreleg at 60 yards. He moved only about 30 feet after    1.67495327387791
the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed    1.67495327387791
through a sapling.   Three more deer have fallen to this same    1.6065767145351917
gun, and all were one-shot kills. My double was made with standard-weight    1.6432600607208703
revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length), and although    1.5127085093302464
it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than    1.5636360329510388
the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.   If ever    1.5636360329510388
a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter, this is it. The Deerstalker    1.7026049541338664
points with the ease, speed and precision of a fine imported    1.6065767145351917
double shotgun, and its trigger pull is light and sharp. The 240-grain    1.6432600607208703
bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 ~fps, which gives it all the smash    1.67495327387791
needed at woods ranges. With five shots at the immediate command    1.6065767145351917
of the hunter's trigger finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.   1.67495327387791
The second really new development this year was a revolver    1.5636360329510388
handling a different sort of varmint load- the .22 Remington Jet    1.6065767145351917
Magnum Center Fire. At present it's available in one model, the    1.6065767145351917
fine and familiar Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110),    1.5127085093302464
long a top-quality handgun among target arms. The velocity of this .22-caliber,    1.6432600607208703
40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 ~fps, and it's    1.6432600607208703
the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range    1.5636360329510388
rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range. This is a varmint load,    1.7026049541338664
pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game.    1.6065767145351917
It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry    1.748515906000203
of feathers.   The most intriguing aspect of the ~S+W Magnum    1.5636360329510388
chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22 rim-fires    1.7026049541338664
by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers. You may therefore    1.6065767145351917
convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm, although the difference    1.6432600607208703
in the point of impact (Jet vs& rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting.    1.6432600607208703
The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested    1.5636360329510388
it in my scoped ~S+W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a    1.748515906000203
chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun    1.748515906000203
steadily.    1.0
The fact that the Deerstalker    1.1606783668269585
and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't    1.6432600607208703
mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers.    1.6065767145351917
Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of hunting rifles have been    1.6432600607208703
introduced for the first time. Here are the brands (in alphabetical    1.6065767145351917
order) and the new models.   Newcomers to the American hunter    1.5636360329510388
are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles. They have    1.5636360329510388
fine ~FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal    1.6065767145351917
and the stock wood. Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various    1.6065767145351917
calibers available, and these include the standard bores (about $165)    1.5636360329510388
plus the Magnums (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300    1.6065767145351917
~H+H, .338, .375 and .458. Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard    1.6065767145351917
on all of the Magnums except the .264. Stock designs are excellent    1.6432600607208703
for use with scopes.   Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are    1.5127085093302464
all made with Sako actions, regardless of caliber. The .222's have    1.6065767145351917
the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action, and the .270,    1.67495327387791
**f and the Magnums, the long action (about $135 for the Standard    1.6432600607208703
Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version). Previously, ~FN actions    1.5636360329510388
were used for the larger cartridges.   High standard has    1.5127085093302464
introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King, in two grades- field and special    1.6432600607208703
(less than $45 and just over $45, respectively). It's a streamlined    1.6065767145351917
rifle, fast and well-made.   Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire    1.4513752902486308
rifles, 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader    1.5636360329510388
(around $60). Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given    1.5636360329510388
this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the    1.6065767145351917
260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum rim-fires.   1.5636360329510388
Marlin    1.0
has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings. The    1.6065767145351917
Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight, streamlined .22 rim-fire auto    1.6065767145351917
with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles. It's extremely    1.6065767145351917
accurate for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely    1.6432600607208703
trouble-free in functioning. The 989 (about $40) is an even newer .22    1.6432600607208703
auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.   Once again the    1.6432600607208703
Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared, but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun    1.6432600607208703
combination. The bore is unrifled but is provided with an    1.5636360329510388
insert tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives pretty fair    1.6065767145351917
accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long. You can unscrew    1.6065767145351917
this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells-    1.7026049541338664
to break the little Targo clay targets. A trap for throwing    1.6065767145351917
these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can    1.6432600607208703
throw his own targets. A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular    1.67495327387791
hand trap are also available. You can have your choice of a seven-shot    1.67495327387791
repeater, the ~340TR (about $40) or a single-shot, the ~320TR    1.5636360329510388
($10 less).   The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting    1.6065767145351917
or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks    1.6065767145351917
to run up a score on the clay birds. They'll travel 50 feet or    1.7026049541338664
more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to    1.6432600607208703
break one after it passes the 35-foot mark. The combination of thin    1.6432600607208703
pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds,    1.67495327387791
right now!   Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line    1.5636360329510388
for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of Model    1.7269387314284994
725's. These are made on special order only, in Kodiak grade    1.6065767145351917
(about $310), with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads;    1.6065767145351917
they weigh around nine pounds.   A shortened version of the    1.5636360329510388
highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961. This    1.5636360329510388
carbine (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has an 18-1/2-inch    1.67495327387791
barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's    1.6065767145351917
Model 760 pump with a short-barrel. This design is hard to beat    1.6432600607208703
for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard. Presently,    1.6065767145351917
the ~742C is available in **f.   The latest versions of the famous    1.6432600607208703
Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the    1.6065767145351917
99 Deluxe (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger    1.6432600607208703
design. The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will    1.5636360329510388
make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new    1.6065767145351917
safety is easier and faster to operate.    1.3761581156320553
A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're    1.6432600607208703
good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to    1.6432600607208703
get for a youngster. The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about    1.7026049541338664
$20, $5 for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot patterned    1.5636360329510388
after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western    1.5127085093302464
look. Because of its traditional lines, it probably has more kid    1.6065767145351917
appeal than any other model. The action is a drop-block, handling all    1.6432600607208703
the standard .22 rim-fires.   Marlin's latest is also designed    1.5127085093302464
for the beginning shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty    1.6065767145351917
of barrel weight and ample stock. This is the Model 122 (about    1.6432600607208703
$20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety-    1.5127085093302464
i&e&, the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun    1.7026049541338664
cocked for the next shot. Stock design is excellent, and this model    1.6432600607208703
is a good first gun. Another boy's model is the .22 single-shot Remington    1.67495327387791
~514C (around $20), which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a    1.6065767145351917
short- 12-1/2-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.   1.6065767145351917
A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year.    1.5127085093302464
The single-barrel Stevens ~940Y (under $35) is made with a side lever    1.6432600607208703
rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong    1.5636360329510388
enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does    1.7269387314284994
indeed open very easily. This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is    1.6432600607208703
available in either 20 or .410 gauge. There's another addition to    1.6065767145351917
the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which    1.6432600607208703
you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters    1.6432600607208703
like this gauge and type of scattergun too.    1.4513752902486308
Although    1.0
there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year,    1.5636360329510388
a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit    1.6432600607208703
the market. For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed    1.6065767145351917
over/under, the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs    1.5636360329510388
from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore    1.67495327387791
end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast    1.6432600607208703
sighting.   The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the Standard    1.6065767145351917
or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150, respectively) in    1.5636360329510388
12, 16 and 20.   Firearms International has introduced another    1.5127085093302464
import, this one from Finland. It's the Valmet (about $170), a 12-gauge    1.6432600607208703
over/under very much like the old Remington 32- which was    1.5636360329510388
so fine    1.0
a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.   High    1.6432600607208703
Standard has also added two models to its line. The Supermatic Trophy    1.6432600607208703
(prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional    1.6432600607208703
features) is a 12-gauge auto. The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at    1.5636360329510388
just over $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16. Either model is a very good    1.7677783654484436
dollar value.   Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is    1.5127085093302464
the Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version of the old    1.67495327387791
Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun. See page 24 for a complete    1.6432600607208703
report on it.    1.0
Aside from the .22 Jet- which    1.2818970554302986
I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two    1.6432600607208703
biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among    1.3761581156320553
1961's handguns.   1.0
LIVERY STABLE- J& VERNON, PROP"& Coaching had declined    1.4513752902486308
considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there, near the old    1.6432600607208703
Wells Fargo building in San Francisco, creaking in the fog as it    1.6432600607208703
had for thirty years. John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared    1.67495327387791
for- he had prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom. Coaching    1.6432600607208703
was in his blood. He had two interests in life: the pleasures    1.6432600607208703
of the table and driving. Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the    1.7026049541338664
Santa Cruz road, upland and through the redwood forest, with orchards    1.6065767145351917
below him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the other. The    1.7026049541338664
journey back he made along the coast road, traveling hell-for-leather,    1.5636360329510388
every lantern of the tallyho ablaze.   The southward route    1.5127085093302464
was the classic run in California, and the most fashionable. His patronage    1.6432600607208703
on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans- regulars,    1.6065767145351917
most of them, and trenchermen like himself. They did not complain    1.6065767145351917
at the inhuman hour of starting (seven in the morning), nor of the    1.67495327387791
tariff, which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco.    1.6065767145351917
Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in the    1.6065767145351917
mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa    1.6432600607208703
Cruz.   Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring, so    1.6065767145351917
halts were contrived between meals. Then the Chinese hostler, who rode    1.6065767145351917
with Vernon on the box, would break open a hamper and produce filets    1.67495327387791
of smoked bass or sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree    1.6432600607208703
to be heated over a spirit lamp.   In spring and in autumn    1.6432600607208703
the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend    1.7026049541338664
of mine. They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and bits of    1.6432600607208703
resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which exists only on a forty-five    1.67495327387791
mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains. In the Spanish    1.6432600607208703
days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense.    1.6065767145351917
It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar.    1.67495327387791
Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips, but he could    1.6065767145351917
arrange no schedule with the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped    1.7026049541338664
off, and the botanists began to motor out by themselves.    1.5636360329510388
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular    1.6432600607208703
tallyho run. This was an honor, like dining with a captain at his private    1.7026049541338664
table. Vernon's office adjoined the stable, and the walls were    1.5636360329510388
adorned with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of the period.    1.6065767145351917
They advertised harness polish, liniments, Ball's Rubber Boots,    1.4513752902486308
Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla, patent medicines,    1.3761581156320553
shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.   The hostler would have the    1.5636360329510388
table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove; then a porter    1.7026049541338664
from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head.    1.67495327387791
It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster    1.67495327387791
salt roast and a mound of corn fritters. Vernon was consummately fond    1.6432600607208703
of oysters, and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil    1.6432600607208703
War. Oyster salt roast- oysters on the half shell, cooked on a bed    1.67495327387791
of coarse salt that kept them hot when served- was a standby at Manning's.    1.7026049541338664
Its early morning patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves    1.5127085093302464
for the day with that delicacy.   In the 1890's the    1.5636360329510388
Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager, John    1.6432600607208703
C& Kirkpatrick. This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller    1.5127085093302464
made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace    1.5636360329510388
chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters. (Gastronomes    1.6065767145351917
have long argued about which came first, the Palace's or Antoine's.    1.6065767145351917
Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod    1.5636360329510388
on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding. The    1.6432600607208703
Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional.) Vernon, however,    1.4513752902486308
held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it, unadorned by herbs    1.67495327387791
or any seasoning but salt, though he did fancy a bit of lemon.    1.67495327387791
After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect the rig; this    1.7026049541338664
was merely a ritual, to please all hands concerned. The tallyho had    1.6432600607208703
cost Vernon $2,300. A replica of two coaches made in England for the    1.67495327387791
Belmont Club in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it    1.6432600607208703
was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run. One could shave in    1.7026049541338664
the reflection of its French-polished panels, and its axles were greased    1.6065767145351917
like those of roulette wheels. The horses were groomed to a high    1.6432600607208703
gloss; departing, they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw,    1.6065767145351917
for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.   But    1.6065767145351917
for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip fell. The clients boarded    1.7026049541338664
the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven. They had been fed    1.6432600607208703
a hunting breakfast, so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified    1.6065767145351917
with fox hunting, was on the bill. There are many ways of making a    1.7026049541338664
kedgeree, every one of which is right. Here is an original kedgeree    1.6432600607208703
recipe from the Family Club's kitchen:    1.2818970554302986
Flake    1.0
(for three) a cupful of cold boiled haddock, mix with a cupful of cooked    1.7026049541338664
rice, two minced hard-boiled eggs, some buttery white sauce done    1.5636360329510388
with cream, cayenne, pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of    1.6432600607208703
minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy. Heat and serve hot on toast.    1.7026049541338664
The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's chef,    1.5127085093302464
was even more in demand. For decades it was the most popular dish    1.67495327387791
served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast, and it is one of the few    1.7026049541338664
old Palace dishes that still survive. Native California oysters,    1.5127085093302464
salty and piquant, as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a    1.67495327387791
five-cent piece, went into it. The original formula goes thus:    1.5636360329510388
Fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with a tablespoonful    1.6065767145351917
of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs, pepper,    1.6432600607208703
celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives, a dash of cayenne, and a    1.67495327387791
pinch of nutmeg. A jigger of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture    1.67495327387791
stiffens, in go a hundred of the little oysters.   Louis Sherry    1.6065767145351917
once stayed a fortnight at the Palace, and he was so pleased with omelet    1.7026049541338664
Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York.    1.6065767145351917
J& Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco,    1.6432600607208703
to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the restaurateur    1.5127085093302464
with him. As things happened, Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill    1.6432600607208703
residence of a magnate friend, whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved    1.6432600607208703
talent. Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused himself    1.6065767145351917
as best he could. Twice he left everything to his entourage, and    1.6432600607208703
fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance.   1.5636360329510388
In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its tiers of Moorish    1.67495327387791
galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's    1.6065767145351917
station was at the entrance. It was a post of honor, held inviolate    1.67495327387791
for him; he had the primacy among the coachmen. Of majestic build,    1.6432600607208703
rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled the late General Winfield    1.5127085093302464
Scott, who was said to be the most imposing general of his century,    1.67495327387791
if not of all centuries. Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia,    1.67495327387791
and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly.   1.5127085093302464
Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in    1.67495327387791
the tallyho. He had style: he held his reins in a loose bunch at the    1.7269387314284994
third button of his checked Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned    1.6432600607208703
at a curve, as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them.    1.748515906000203
They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until the coach reached    1.6065767145351917
Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin.   The road    1.5127085093302464
maps of the region have changed since 1905; inns have burned down, moved    1.67495327387791
elsewhere, or taken other names. Once on the road (and especially    1.6065767145351917
if the passengers were all regulars and masculine), the schedule meant    1.6065767145351917
nothing. An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of    1.5636360329510388
the tallyho, from which there issued clouds of smoke. Vernon would tilt    1.6432600607208703
his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard,    1.7026049541338664
indulging in a huge cigar. The horses moved at a clump; they were no    1.7026049541338664
more on parade than was their driver; one fork of the road was as    1.7026049541338664
good as another. The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties,    1.6065767145351917
and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed    1.5636360329510388
columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes the Santa Clara    1.6432600607208703
valley below at the left. The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts    1.6065767145351917
of fernery. You arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted    1.6432600607208703
not to bring a mackintosh.   Vernon kept an account book    1.5636360329510388
with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage.    1.67495327387791
A number of them must have fallen into disfavor; they were    1.6065767145351917
struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing both the cooks and the    1.67495327387791
management. He was copious in his praise of those that served food that    1.67495327387791
was good to eat. The horses seemed to know these by instinct, he used    1.7026049541338664
to say: such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins.   1.6065767145351917
There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees, its wide    1.5636360329510388
verandas strewn with rockers. Many of its sojourners were devoted    1.5636360329510388
to seclusion and quiet, and lived there to the end of their days. It    1.7026049541338664
was    1.0
the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods. Acorns    1.6065767145351917
from the great oaks fed the small black pigs (akin to Berkshires),    1.6432600607208703
whose "carcass sweepstakes" were renowned. Their ham butts, cured    1.5127085093302464
in oak-log smoke, were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served    1.6432600607208703
with this original sauce:    1.0
Put into    1.0
a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy, or of the boiled ham liquor,    1.7269387314284994
with a half stick of butter, three teaspoonfuls of made mustard,    1.6065767145351917
and two mashed garlic cloves. Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato    1.6432600607208703
and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime. After this has simmered    1.6432600607208703
an hour, add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire, catsup, and    1.5636360329510388
chutney, two pickled walnuts, and a pint of Sherry. Then simmer fifteen    1.6432600607208703
Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made    1.5127085093302464
and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar, so    1.748515906000203
that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.   Vineyards    1.5636360329510388
and orchards also grew around Wright's, and deer were rather a nuisance;    1.6432600607208703
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers. But    1.5636360329510388
no one complained when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison    1.6432600607208703
pies. No one complained of the white wine either: at this altitude    1.6432600607208703
of two thousand feet, grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint.    1.67495327387791
(The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height.) Apple    1.5636360329510388
trees grew there also. Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains    1.6065767145351917
flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring, the apples that    1.67495327387791
grow there have a wintry crackle.   Dwellers thereabouts preferred    1.5127085093302464
to get their apple pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven    1.7026049541338664
fired with redwood billets. The merit of the pie, Vernon believed,    1.6065767145351917
was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven. The recipe,    1.748515906000203
which he got from the baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically    1.7026049541338664
this:    1.0
Peel, core, and slice across    1.1606783668269585
enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin, and set aside. In a    1.7269387314284994
saucepan put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount of sugar,    1.6432600607208703
a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam, a pinch each    1.67495327387791
of clove and nutmeg, and a large bay leaf. Let this boil gently for    1.7026049541338664
twenty minutes, then strain. Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve    1.6432600607208703
minutes, drain them, and cool.   Set the apples in the pastry-lined    1.6065767145351917
tin, spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter,    1.5127085093302464
with as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a fresh bay leaf,    1.7026049541338664
then lay on a cover of pastry, and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.   1.7269387314284994
THOSE WHO have never traveled the width and length of this    1.6065767145351917
land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook description alone, the    1.6065767145351917
overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one    1.6065767145351917
government. The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most    1.6065767145351917
strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the    1.6432600607208703
Midwest; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains; the    1.5127085093302464
smoke-filled, art-filled, drama-filled life of the great cities of the    1.5636360329510388
East; the lush and historic charm of the South. Now, to add to the    1.7026049541338664
already unbelievable extremes found in one nation, we have the two    1.6065767145351917
new states of Hawaii and Alaska.   To hope to cover just one    1.6432600607208703
region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and, of    1.7269387314284994
course, to bring back pictures of your experiences, requires advance planning.    1.6065767145351917
For this reason, <U&S& Camera> has prepared this special    1.5127085093302464
U&S&A& vacation feature. We divided the country into five    1.5127085093302464
regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general    1.6432600607208703
description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events    1.6065767145351917
to cover. Any special photographic requirements are also given.   1.5127085093302464
Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation    1.67495327387791
in photogenic America.    1.0
BIRTHPLACE of the    1.0
nation, the Northeast offers historic battlefields; lovely old villages    1.5127085093302464
and a rugged seashore among its many worthwhile sights. The rolling    1.6065767145351917
farms of Maryland, the peerless metropolis of New York City,    1.5636360329510388
the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included in your Northeast    1.6432600607208703
vacation.   By automobile from New York, for example, you can    1.5636360329510388
take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis, Maryland to see the colonial    1.67495327387791
homes and the U&S& Naval Academy (where you can shoot the    1.6065767145351917
dress parade on Wednesdays); to Washington, D&C&, for an eye-filling    1.5636360329510388
tour of the city; or to Lancaster, Pa&, the center of    1.6065767145351917
the Pennsylvania Dutch country; Philadelphia with its historic buildings    1.5127085093302464
and nearby Valley Forge; to West Point, N&Y&, the    1.5127085093302464
famous military academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River.   1.6065767145351917
New England deserves as much of your vacation time as you can    1.6432600607208703
afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing wonderful beaches, artists'    1.6065767145351917
colonies and quaint townships. From here you can easily include    1.5636360329510388
a side trip to the old whaling port of Nantucket, Massachusetts,    1.6065767145351917
which looks just as it must have two centuries ago.   At Sturbridge    1.6432600607208703
Village, Massachusetts, you'll find a completely-restored New    1.3761581156320553
England town. North to Acadia National Park, Maine, with views    1.5636360329510388
of a rockbound coast and dark, magnificent forests.   One of the    1.6065767145351917
most exciting ways to end a Northeast vacation would be with a week    1.67495327387791
in New York City. Return through New England, stopping for a visit    1.6432600607208703
to Lake Champlain where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan    1.7026049541338664
Allen Park. There you'll witness a view which includes the Adirondack    1.6065767145351917
Mts& and the Winooski River.   Now you're ready for    1.5127085093302464
a whirlwind sightseeing tour of America's most exciting city. The    1.5636360329510388
skyline, the bridges, Broadway, and the Staten Island ferry are    1.5636360329510388
only a few of the spots to put on your "must" list for New York    1.7269387314284994
City.    1.0
Some tips for shooting in    1.1606783668269585
Northeastern locales: In New York City don't miss coverage    1.5127085093302464
of the United Nations. These striking, modernistic buildings on the    1.5636360329510388
East River are open to the public and every weekday guided tours are    1.67495327387791
available. Pictures can be taken in the public areas and when on tours.    1.67495327387791
However, the use of tripods is not allowed. Photos of Conference    1.6065767145351917
Rooms and the General Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms    1.6432600607208703
are not being used for meetings. Flash is allowed, subject to above    1.6432600607208703
restrictions.   Around New England, you'll no doubt want a    1.5127085093302464
color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses. Be careful here not    1.6432600607208703
to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and    1.5636360329510388
light-reflecting.    1.0
In color, 1/50th of a second between **f and **f will do for    1.67495327387791
bright, frontal sunlight.    1.0
THE SOUTHERN United    1.0
States, extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west,    1.6432600607208703
still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance.    1.6065767145351917
It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty    1.5636360329510388
encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation, on the one hand, to places    1.6432600607208703
where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided    1.5636360329510388
for the tourist with camera.   Of special interest this anniversary    1.5636360329510388
year of the war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields    1.67495327387791
where, likely as not, you'll catch some memorial re-enactments.    1.5127085093302464
Among the locales to visit are Shiloh, Tennessee; Lookout Mountain,    1.5636360329510388
Tennessee; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Richmond, Virginia;    1.1606783668269585
Petersburg, Virginia, and Fredericksburg, Virginia.   Florida    1.2818970554302986
provides tropical scenes unequalled in the United States. At    1.5127085093302464
Cypress Gardens special bleachers are set up for photographers at water-ski    1.6065767145351917
shows and lovely models pose for pictures in garden settings.    1.5636360329510388
Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and in Everglades National    1.5636360329510388
Park there are opportunities to photograph rare wildlife. Miami    1.5127085093302464
Beach and surroundings feature fabulous "hotel row", palm-studded    1.4513752902486308
beaches plus the Miami Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle.    1.4513752902486308
One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour is the city of New    1.7269387314284994
Orleans. The famous old French and Spanish buildings with their    1.5636360329510388
elaborate wrought iron balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin    1.6065767145351917
Quarter present an Old World scene.   For restoration of early    1.5636360329510388
American life the places to visit are Williamsburg, Jamestown and    1.5636360329510388
Yorktown, Virginia. Another Virginia sight and a photographic adventure    1.5127085093302464
are the Luray Caverns, lit by photofloodlights.   The    1.4513752902486308
great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions such as the Dallas    1.6065767145351917
Fair Park with its art and natural history museums. In contrast    1.6065767145351917
are the vast open stretches of ranch country and oil wells. In San    1.67495327387791
Antonio visit the famous Alamo and photograph 18th Century Spanish    1.5636360329510388
buildings and churches.   The Great Smoky Mountains is another    1.5127085093302464
area of the South well worth a visit. Along the 127-mile route through    1.67495327387791
Great Smoky Mountains National Park you can photograph the    1.5127085093302464
breath-taking peaks, gorges and valleys which come into view at every    1.6065767145351917
turn. Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is the center of this area. Another scenic    1.6065767145351917
spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens    1.5636360329510388
are not to be missed.   Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks    1.6065767145351917
of the South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston,    1.6065767145351917
S&C&, Natchez, Miss&, and Savannah, Ga&. At Charlottesville,    1.4513752902486308
Va&, shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the    1.5127085093302464
University.    1.0
Foliage is the outstanding photo    1.1606783668269585
subject in many of the Southern locales mentioned above and some    1.6065767145351917
specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in order. For example,    1.7026049541338664
the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, sponsors special    1.5127085093302464
camera tours into the Great Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the    1.6432600607208703
profusion of wild flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.   1.5127085093302464
Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting    1.6065767145351917
results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches.    1.5636360329510388
Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight    1.6065767145351917
or shade. In any instance, you should determine the exposure according    1.6065767145351917
to the type of light which falls on most of the subject area.   1.67495327387791
Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast    1.6065767145351917
with the many long-view scenics you'll be making.   For    1.5127085093302464
shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make    1.5636360329510388
sure your equipment includes a tripod. Enough daylight is usually    1.5636360329510388
available from the windows, but if you have synchronized flash- use    1.6065767145351917
it.   For some unusual photographic subjects, if your vacation takes    1.5636360329510388
you nearby, try these events: the 600-mile auto race in Charlotte,    1.6065767145351917
N& C&, on May 27; the Florida Folk Festival, White Springs,    1.6065767145351917
May 5-7; Singing on the Mountain in Linville, North Carolina,    1.5636360329510388
on June 25. Peak action photography is your goal at Miami's    1.6065767145351917
Seaquarium and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events.    1.3761581156320553
A PLEASANT start to your midwestern vacation is a few    1.5636360329510388
days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago. Lake Michigan offers swimming    1.5127085093302464
and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches. A visit to Chicago's    1.6065767145351917
museums and a stroll around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold    1.5636360329510388
many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer.   Wisconsin    1.4513752902486308
Dells, where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin River    1.5636360329510388
are overgrown with fern and other foliage, rates a stopover when    1.6065767145351917
traveling from Chicago.   The farmlands forming the heart of America    1.5636360329510388
stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago. In North Dakota    1.5636360329510388
the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its    1.5636360329510388
wonder on to film. While here, visit Theodore Roosevelt National    1.5636360329510388
Park for its spectacular scenery.   Another spot with an image-provoking    1.5636360329510388
name is the Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier    1.6432600607208703
mining town of Deadwood. The Black Hills Passion Play is produced    1.6065767145351917
every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting.    1.5636360329510388
Of course, while in this vicinity you won't want to miss a visit to    1.7026049541338664
Mount Rushmore National Memorial where on the side of a mountain    1.6065767145351917
are the famous sculptures of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson    1.5127085093302464
and Theodore Roosevelt.   In Missouri (which we are including    1.5127085093302464
in our general Midwest region) you can glance into Mark Twain's    1.6065767145351917
birthplace at Hannibal, see the landmarks of his life and writings    1.6065767145351917
and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief.   1.5127085093302464
Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to be seen- his    1.6065767145351917
tomb and other landmarks.   Minnesota, fabled land of waters, is    1.5636360329510388
in itself, ideal vacationland,    1.0
having within its borders 10,000 lakes!    1.2818970554302986
Itasca State Park, where the Mississippi River begins, is one    1.5636360329510388
of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota.   Mementoes of the    1.5636360329510388
Old West recall the days of Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, Nebraska,    1.6432600607208703
where present-day cowboys add a colorful human interest note to your    1.6065767145351917
vacation shooting.   Of current interest is Abilene, Kansas,    1.4513752902486308
the birthplace of ex-President Eisenhower. There's a museum here    1.5127085093302464
and also Old Abilene Town, a reconstruction of the cattle boomtown    1.6065767145351917
of the 70's and 80's.   For a resort area, Mackinack Island,    1.6065767145351917
Michigan, is the place to visit. It truly relives another age for    1.6432600607208703
the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and old British and    1.6065767145351917
French forts are left intact for tourists to visit and record.    1.6065767145351917
Night scenes will add an exciting touch to    1.4513752902486308
your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along    1.6432600607208703
Chicago's Lake Shore Drive? Just after sunset is a good time    1.6065767145351917
to record the city lights in color since you get a "fill-in" light    1.67495327387791
from the sky.   Another memo for sightseers: bring your camera    1.5636360329510388
along to museums. Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit    1.6432600607208703
will add depth and background to your vacation photo story. Again,    1.6065767145351917
be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures.   1.6065767145351917
Special events and their dates which will make interesting    1.5127085093302464
shooting in the Midwest area, include the following:   A re-enactment    1.5636360329510388
of the Battle of Lexington, May 18th at Lexington, Missouri;    1.5636360329510388
the world-renowned 500-mile auto race at Indianapolis, Indiana,    1.4513752902486308
plus a festival from May 27-30; "Song of Hiawatha", in    1.5636360329510388
Elgin, Illinois, from June 20 to 24th. Michigan offers the lovely    1.6065767145351917
Tulip Festival in Holland, Michigan, May 12-14; the ~USGA    1.5127085093302464
Open in Birmingham from June 15-17; and the International Freedom    1.5636360329510388
Festival in Detroit, June 29-July 4.   For early vacationers    1.5127085093302464
there's the fun-filled Fishing Derby in Hot Springs, Arkansas,    1.5127085093302464
April 19-23, and the Arkansas Band Festival in Hot Springs,    1.5636360329510388
April 20-22.    1.0
A WESTERN VACATION is practically    1.1606783668269585
synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks    1.67495327387791
in this area. A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week    1.7026049541338664
vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can    1.67495327387791
be of equal reward.   In California is located one of the most    1.6432600607208703
popular of the national parks- Yosemite. Among its most spectacular    1.5636360329510388
features are its falls, the highest being Upper Yosemite which drops    1.6065767145351917
2,425 feet. The Sequoia Grove presents another unique aspect of    1.5636360329510388
Yosemite, for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.   1.67495327387791
In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon    1.6065767145351917
National Park. Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful    1.6065767145351917
formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in    1.6432600607208703
both parks.   Colorado's Grand Canyon, probably the most famous    1.5127085093302464
landmark of the United States, can be the highpoint of your Western    1.6432600607208703
vacation.   1.0
BUILT UPON seven hills, Istanbul, like Rome, is one of    1.5636360329510388
the most ancient cities in the world, filled with splendor and contrast.    1.6432600607208703
It is an exotic place, so different from the ordinary that the casual    1.67495327387791
tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness    1.67495327387791
of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses. At the moment, many    1.6065767145351917
of these are being pulled down. Whole blocks are disappearing and more    1.6432600607208703
are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will    1.6432600607208703
show off its treasures to better advantage- the great domes and graceful    1.6432600607208703
spires of its mosques, the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden    1.6432600607208703
Horn. Even when they are finished, however, the contrast will    1.5636360329510388
remain, for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon    1.7026049541338664
two continents. For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed    1.6065767145351917
shoulders in its streets.   Founded in the Ninth Century B&C&    1.5636360329510388
it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas, ruler of    1.6065767145351917
the Megarians, expanded the settlement and named it after himself. About    1.6065767145351917
a thousand years after that, when the Roman Empire was divided,    1.6065767145351917
it became capital of the Eastern section. On May 11, 330 A&D&,    1.6432600607208703
its name was changed again, this time to Constantinople after its    1.6065767145351917
emperor, Constantine. In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman    1.6065767145351917
power fell to the Turks, the city officially shifted religions-    1.5636360329510388
although the Patriarch, or Pope, of the Orthodox Church continued    1.5636360329510388
to live there, and still does- and became the capital of the Ottoman    1.67495327387791
Empire. When <that> was broken up after the First World War,    1.6065767145351917
its name was changed once more. Rich in Christian and Moslem art,    1.6432600607208703
Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that    1.6065767145351917
recently    1.0
became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on    1.67495327387791
the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the    1.67495327387791
center of town. Easy to get to, and becoming more popular every year,    1.67495327387791
it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World    1.6432600607208703
Airways jet, four hours from Rome.    1.2818970554302986
Most of the    1.0
sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern    1.67495327387791
hotels. I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist    1.6432600607208703
Office, next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter    1.6432600607208703
the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel. From there I turned    1.6432600607208703
left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left,    1.67495327387791
Republic Gardens, and came in a few moments to Taksim Square, one    1.6432600607208703
of the hubs of the city, with the Monument of the Republic, erected    1.67495327387791
in 1928, in its center.   Directly across from the Gardens I    1.6065767145351917
found a bus stop sign for ~T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus,    1.7269387314284994
with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and    1.7026049541338664
the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that. There    1.5127085093302464
the bus turned right along the Bosphorus, past ocean liners at anchor,    1.6432600607208703
to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep    1.67495327387791
of water that empties into the Bosphorus. Across the bridge on    1.6065767145351917
the left I saw St& Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the    1.7026049541338664
right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque.   On    1.6065767145351917
the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square,    1.6432600607208703
with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque, which dates from the Seventeenth    1.6432600607208703
Century, just across from the entrance to the bridge. Passing it,    1.6065767145351917
the bus climbed a hill, with the covered spice bazaar on the right and    1.7026049541338664
Pandelli's, a famous and excellent restaurant, above it. At the    1.5636360329510388
top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park. I got    1.748515906000203
off there, crossed the street, walked ahead with St& Sophia on my    1.6432600607208703
left, the Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the entrance    1.7269387314284994
of St& Sophia.   Erected on the site of pagan temples and    1.6065767145351917
three previous St& Sophias, the first of which was begun by Constantine,    1.6432600607208703
this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed    1.6065767145351917
twenty years later. On his first trip to the finished structure    1.6065767145351917
he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem.    1.67495327387791
A few years later the dome fell in. Nevertheless, it remained    1.6065767145351917
one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire, where    1.6065767145351917
the Byzantine Emperors were crowned. After the Turks conquered the    1.5636360329510388
city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets.    1.67495327387791
In the second half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect    1.6432600607208703
who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive buttresses    1.6065767145351917
that now help support the dome. With the birth of the Turkish    1.6432600607208703
Republic after the First World War, St& Sophia became a museum,    1.6065767145351917
and the ancient mosaics, which were plastered over by the Moslems,    1.6065767145351917
whose religion forbids pictures in holy places, have been restored.   1.5636360329510388
Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which shows    1.6432600607208703
Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering    1.6065767145351917
the temple. On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques    1.6432600607208703
with Arabic writing. The eight green columns, I learned, came    1.5636360329510388
from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the others, red, from the Temple    1.67495327387791
of the Sun at Heliopolis.   Beneath the dome I saw the    1.6065767145351917
spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned, a bit of floor protected    1.6432600607208703
now by a wooden fence. Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit    1.67495327387791
and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork, where the emperors    1.6432600607208703
and, after them, the sultans, sat. Directly opposite is the emperor's    1.6065767145351917
door, through which they entered the building.   Outside    1.4513752902486308
St& Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it, with    1.67495327387791
the Blue Mosque ahead on my left. Across the street on my right I    1.7026049541338664
saw the Hippodrome, now a park. It was laid out in 196 for chariot    1.7026049541338664
races and other public games. Statues and other monuments that stood    1.6065767145351917
there were stolen, mostly by the waves of Crusaders.   At    1.5636360329510388
the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain, an    1.6065767145351917
ugly octagonal building with a glass dome, built in 1895 by the German    1.67495327387791
Emperor, and on my left, directly across from it, the tomb of Sultan    1.67495327387791
Ahmet, who constructed the Blue Mosque, more properly known by    1.5636360329510388
his name.   Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed    1.6065767145351917
the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead to the Obelisk    1.6065767145351917
of Theodosius, originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600    1.5636360329510388
B&C& by Thutmose, who also built those now in New York,    1.6065767145351917
London and Rome at the Lateran. This one was set up here in 390 A&D&    1.7269387314284994
on a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues of    1.6432600607208703
the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome, done so    1.6432600607208703
realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them.   Beyond    1.5636360329510388
it I noted a small green column, about twelve feet below the present    1.67495327387791
ground level- the Serpentine Column, three entwined serpents,    1.4513752902486308
which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece. Near    1.6432600607208703
the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated    1.67495327387791
obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that once rivalled    1.6432600607208703
the Colossus of Rhodes.    1.0
Retracing my steps    1.0
to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only one with six minarets, I entered    1.67495327387791
the courtyard, with a gallery supported by pointed arches running    1.5636360329510388
around it and a fountain in the middle. One of the most beautiful    1.67495327387791
buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth    1.67495327387791
Century, with a huge central dome, two half domes that seem    1.6065767145351917
to cascade down from it, and smaller full domes around the gallery.    1.6432600607208703
The round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular bases and    1.6065767145351917
have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer.    1.67495327387791
Inside, the walls are covered with blue and white tile, the floor    1.6432600607208703
with red and cream carpets.   Back at the Kaiser's Fountain,    1.5636360329510388
I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill- any    1.67495327387791
car will do- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the Burnt    1.67495327387791
Column, at the top on my right. It stands in the middle of what    1.7026049541338664
was once the Forum of Constantine, who brought it from Rome.   1.6065767145351917
I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning right, it entered    1.7026049541338664
a huge square, Bayezit, with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and    1.6432600607208703
the gate to the university just beyond it. There I got off, crossed    1.67495327387791
the square, and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good    1.67495327387791
restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the city. Called the Marmara    1.7026049541338664
Gazinosu, it is on the third floor, with signs pointing the way    1.6432600607208703
there, and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. After lunch,    1.6432600607208703
in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a    1.7026049541338664
pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava- a sweet, flaky cake-    1.67495327387791
in Istanbul. It's a great favorite of the university students,    1.5636360329510388
and I joined them there for dessert.   Taking the streetcar back    1.6065767145351917
to Kaiser's Fountain, I walked ahead, then left down the street    1.6065767145351917
opposite St& Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small,    1.6432600607208703
one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the entrance to the    1.6432600607208703
Sunken Palace. Actually an underground cistern, its roof supported    1.5127085093302464
by rows and rows of pillars, it was built by Justinian in the Sixth    1.7026049541338664
Century to supply the palace with water. There is still water in it.    1.67495327387791
I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately.    1.5127085093302464
Outside I walked past the entrance to St& Sophia, turned left at    1.6432600607208703
the end of it, and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead. Just    1.7026049541338664
before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks    1.7026049541338664
somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering in gold and    1.6065767145351917
colored tile decorations- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet.   1.4513752902486308
Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall, I entered the grounds    1.6432600607208703
of Topkapi Palace, home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast    1.67495327387791
Ottoman Empire, and walked along a road toward another gate in the    1.6432600607208703
distance, past the Church of St& Irene, completed by Constantine    1.5636360329510388
in 330 A&D& on my left, and then, just outside the second    1.6432600607208703
gate, I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right- the Executioner's    1.748515906000203
Spring, where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading    1.6065767145351917
his victims.   Passing through the gate, with towers on either    1.5636360329510388
side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square surrounded by    1.6432600607208703
buildings, and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds,    1.7269387314284994
with explanations in English for each building. There are a    1.5636360329510388
good many of them. At one time about 10,000 people lived there.   1.6432600607208703
Following arrowed signs, I veered right toward the former kitchens,    1.5636360329510388
complete with chimneys, which now house one of the world's greatest    1.6065767145351917
collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner    1.6065767145351917
services. Next to it is a copper section, with cooking utensils    1.6065767145351917
and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate, floor-length robe.   1.6432600607208703
In the court once more, I went right toward the Reception House,    1.6432600607208703
a long one-story building with a deep portico. Going through a door    1.6432600607208703
into another small court, I had the Throne Room directly in front.    1.6432600607208703
I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated    1.6065767145351917
manuscripts and came to the Treasury, which houses such things as coffee    1.6432600607208703
cups covered with diamonds, jewelled swords, rifles glittering with    1.5127085093302464
diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds, on which    1.6432600607208703
the sultans sat cross-legged. They are made of gold and covered with    1.6432600607208703
emeralds, pearls and other jewels.   Taking the path behind    1.5127085093302464
the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it, the Portrait Gallery,    1.6432600607208703
I went right at the end of it, through a garden to a small building    1.7269387314284994
at the back- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans, its    1.6432600607208703
floor covered with carpets, its ceiling painted with gold squares and    1.6065767145351917
floral designs.   1.0
<DO> start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain    1.6432600607208703
a    1.0
lasting bed of glowing coals. Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next    1.67495327387791
to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot, and to stop flames that    1.7026049541338664
arise from melting grease.   <Do> line barbecue fire bowl    1.5127085093302464
with    1.0
heavy foil to reflect heat.   <Don't> forget to buy a plastic    1.6065767145351917
pastry brush for basting with sauces. Clean it meticulously in boiling    1.6065767145351917
water and detergent, rinse thoroughly.   <Do> build a wall    1.5127085093302464
of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued    1.7026049541338664
on an electric spit. Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the    1.7269387314284994
hood for heating vegetables, sauces and such.   <Don't>    1.4513752902486308
fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly    1.67495327387791
larger than the surface of steaks and chops. Sear on both sides then    1.67495327387791
cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results.   1.5636360329510388
<Do> avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them. If doubtful    1.6432600607208703
about a steak, boldly cut it in half. If necessary to replace    1.6432600607208703
both halves on grill, sear cuts and allot extra time. For roasts, insert    1.67495327387791
meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone. Also make    1.6432600607208703
sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals.   1.6432600607208703
<Don't> practice a new recipe on guests. Have a test-run    1.5636360329510388
on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning are right.   1.6432600607208703
<Do> buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it. Keep    1.7269387314284994
it no longer than 36 hours before cooking, and keep it in the coldest    1.7026049541338664
(but non-freezing) compartment of the refrigerator.   <Don't>    1.3761581156320553
plan meals that are too complicated. Limit yourself to good meat    1.6065767145351917
and drink, with bread, salad, corn or potatoes as accessories. Keep    1.6065767145351917
the desserts simple; fruit does nicely.   <Do> whatever kitchen    1.5127085093302464
work, such as fixing a salad, preparing garlic bread, or making    1.6065767145351917
a marinade sauce, ahead of time. When you start the outdoor performance,    1.6432600607208703
you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen.    1.6432600607208703
(This goes for getting a drink tray ready, and for having a big cooler    1.7026049541338664
full of ice on hand long before the party begins.)    1.5636360329510388
<Don't>    1.0
think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the    1.6432600607208703
world. The simplest grill (pan type) or inexpensive hibachi can make    1.6065767145351917
you a chef. You need tongs to handle meat; long forks for turning    1.67495327387791
potatoes and corn; heavy foil on hand at all times. And lots of hot    1.7026049541338664
pads!   <Do> keep the grill high enough above the fire so that    1.6432600607208703
when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames cannot reach the    1.67495327387791
meat.   <Don't> forget to have a supply of Melamine plates,    1.5636360329510388
bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use. Made of the world's    1.6432600607208703
toughest unbreakable plastic, Melamine dinnerware comes in almost    1.4513752902486308
400 different patterns and dozens of colors. There is even one    1.6065767145351917
set that has "barbecue" written on it.   <Do> without fancy    1.5636360329510388
tablecloths. It's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor    1.5636360329510388
table. Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns    1.6432600607208703
for different kinds of barbecues. Oilcloth only costs about 79~c a    1.6065767145351917
yard for the very best. Tougher than plastic, it wears well.    1.6065767145351917
<Don't> forget- when you take to the hills or the beach- that    1.6432600607208703
your cooler, which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your    1.67495327387791
terrace or back yard, is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.    1.5636360329510388
There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes.    1.6065767145351917
With them, you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures,    1.6065767145351917
and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the    1.6432600607208703
marina or picnic, in A-1 condition.   <Do> use paper napkins;    1.5636360329510388
lots of them. Except when you prepare "do it yourself" shish    1.6065767145351917
kebob or a lobster roast. Then you'll want terry cloth towels    1.6065767145351917
for mopping up.   <Don't> think barbecue cooking is just sometimes,    1.5636360329510388
or seasonal. It's year-round, and everywhere. In the winter,    1.5127085093302464
hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace. Even    1.67495327387791
use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter, inside. Summertime    1.6432600607208703
supper, outside, is a natural. You'll find, once your technique    1.5636360329510388
is perfected, that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic.   1.67495327387791
<Do> buy all-purpose mugs or cups. Get copper or    1.5127085093302464
earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot. Be sure to get    1.67495327387791
a few more than you need. You will discover you keep the sauce for basting    1.7269387314284994
meat in one, use six for drinks, serve soup or coffee in another    1.67495327387791
half-dozen- and need one more to mix the salad dressing.   <Don't>    1.6065767145351917
forget the joys of a meal on the road. If you travel over the    1.7026049541338664
vast U&S&A& you will, no doubt, discover that feeding is an    1.6065767145351917
expensive business. Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment    1.6065767145351917
to work. You <can> take it with you **h a picnic bag, a    1.67495327387791
grill,    1.0
a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen convenience foods. Eat    1.67495327387791
in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings; or just evenings.    1.6065767145351917
Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas (gasoline companies    1.6432600607208703
have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to    1.6065767145351917
tell you where you have barbecue facilities) and- with soft drinks    1.6065767145351917
cooled from morning loading up, hamburger, buns, an array of relishes,    1.6065767145351917
and fresh fruit- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant,    1.6432600607208703
and 100% more fun. You need a little stove, a coffee pot and a stew    1.7269387314284994
pot; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials like salt, pepper, plates,    1.6432600607208703
forks, knives and a can opener. As you pull out of your motel or    1.7026049541338664
national park home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what you    1.6065767145351917
need for the next meal. For 25~c load up the cooler with ice and    1.7026049541338664
keep cool pop in the car.    1.2818970554302986
SPICE is a fact of    1.1606783668269585
life in the U&S&A&. You only have to think of franks and sausages    1.67495327387791
to know what I mean. Go a step further and list all the wonderful    1.7026049541338664
barbecue basics- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst,    1.3761581156320553
bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, Bologna, pepperoni, blutwurst- and    1.3761581156320553
you have a long list of easy specialties. Threaded on a skewer with    1.67495327387791
new boiled potatoes, a bit of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom-    1.6432600607208703
any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a feast.   1.748515906000203
Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite. A    1.6432600607208703
story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St& Louis, around    1.6065767145351917
1883 served his sausages (grilled) and mustard to his fancy customers.    1.6065767145351917
So that his customers should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued    1.6065767145351917
white gloves. Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the    1.5636360329510388
customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise.    1.6432600607208703
He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks. Years later,    1.67495327387791
franks-in-buns were accepted as the "first to go" at the New    1.6065767145351917
York Polo Grounds.   The nations's number one picnic treat    1.5127085093302464
is the skinless frankfurter- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or,    1.6432600607208703
more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill. Either way it's    1.6065767145351917
hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation. To make the    1.7026049541338664
picnic frank come close to perfection, remember these tips:   1.5127085093302464
-Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of    1.6432600607208703
the way through. This permits the juices to permeate the meat during    1.6432600607208703
cooking.   -Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank    1.6065767145351917
as are buns. Bring along the conventional ones- catsup, pickle relish,    1.6065767145351917
mustard, mayonnaise- plus a few extras, such as tangy barbecue    1.5636360329510388
sauce, chive cream cheese, or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.   1.67495327387791
-Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns,    1.5636360329510388
too. Watch closely while browning them, as it doesn't take long.   1.6065767145351917
-An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks    1.5636360329510388
in French dressing or a mixture of honey, lemon juice and brown sugar    1.67495327387791
prior to the picnic. Broil or toast as usual.   Contrary to    1.6065767145351917
popular opinion, "a la mode" doesn't mean "with ice cream"-    1.5636360329510388
it just means, in the latest style. Here are a couple of the latest,    1.7026049541338664

glazing and firing are not given.    1.2818970554302986
Basic pottery    1.0
studio equipment. Wooden butter molds and cookie presses.    1.4513752902486308
Ceramic modeling clay: red, white or buff. Stoneware clay    1.5127085093302464
for tiles. Glazes, one-stroke ceramic colors, stains, cones as indicated    1.5636360329510388
in the individual instructions.    1.0
Use    1.0
well-wedged clay,    1.0
free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without    1.5636360329510388
cracking. Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly; they must be    1.5636360329510388
free of oil, wax and dust. _PRESSING DESIGNS:_ The size of wooden    1.6432600607208703
mold will determine the amount of clay needed. Roll clay to thickness    1.6432600607208703
indicated in individual instructions. Whenever possible, use the    1.4513752902486308
wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay. When mold has more than one    1.7026049541338664
design cavity, make individual paper patterns. Place mold or paper    1.5636360329510388
pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position    1.67495327387791
(cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for    1.6065767145351917
defects; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes    1.5127085093302464
and colors). Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity    1.6432600607208703
design side of wooden mold. To obtain clear impression of mold, press    1.6432600607208703
clay gently but firmly into mold cavity, starting at center and working    1.6432600607208703
to outer edges. Trim excess clay away from outer edges. Check thickness    1.6432600607208703
of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little    1.67495327387791
water and adding small pieces of clay. Be sure to press the additional    1.67495327387791
clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles. Allow    1.5636360329510388
project to stand for about five minutes (if wooden press mold is a good    1.7026049541338664
antique, do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold    1.7026049541338664
to crack).   To release clay from mold, place hands in a cupped    1.6432600607208703
position around project; gently lift the edge on far side, then continue    1.6432600607208703
to release edge completely around mold. Slight tapping on the    1.5636360329510388
underside of mold will help release the clay, but too much agitation will    1.67495327387791
cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay    1.67495327387791
from mold. Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on    1.67495327387791
clay and reverse bat, clay and mold in one action. This will prevent    1.67495327387791
the clay from twisting or bending, causing warping when fired. Place    1.6065767145351917
project on table and carefully lift the mold off. Study surface of clay    1.67495327387791
for defects or desired corrections. If clay is slightly out of shape,    1.6432600607208703
square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against    1.5636360329510388
opposite sides, or smooth round pieces with damp fingers. if the background    1.6432600607208703
of design is too smooth, or you wish to create a wood-grained effect,    1.67495327387791
it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle    1.7269387314284994
of a fine paintbrush. Make slight, smooth grooves rather than cuts    1.6065767145351917
for the texture (cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating    1.6432600607208703
pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing). Leave the clay on    1.6432600607208703
plaster board to dry slowly, covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic    1.67495327387791
or cloth to prevent warping.    1.1606783668269585

design head from bowl of butter mold. Fill small hole in bowl with clay.    1.7026049541338664
Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid (see Fig& 1,    1.6432600607208703
opposite page). Measurements    1.0
for rectangular pattern piece ~A are obtained    1.3761581156320553
by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl.    1.5636360329510388
Pattern for circular base piece ~B is diameter of ~A. Use wooden    1.6432600607208703
design head of mold for pattern ~C; pattern ~D for lid fits    1.6432600607208703
over top diameter of ~A. Pattern for inner lid piece ~E fits    1.6432600607208703
inside ~A. Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold.   Use    1.6065767145351917
white or buff clay, rolled to 3/16'' thickness. Place patterns    1.5636360329510388
on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position. Place    1.67495327387791
clay pieces on wall board.   To assemble jar, put paper pattern    1.6065767145351917
~B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk ~B on top. Line    1.7026049541338664
sides of mold with paper pattern ~A. Bevel and score ends of clay    1.67495327387791
piece ~A so that they overlap about 1/2'' and make even thickness.    1.6432600607208703
Place clay piece ~A inside; use slip to join overlapped ends    1.6065767145351917
together. Join ~B to bottom of ~A, scoring and reinforcing with    1.6065767145351917
clay coil. Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside    1.67495327387791
while assembling lid.   To assemble lid, press clay piece ~C    1.5636360329510388
in cavity of wooden design head. Press clay into mold as instructed    1.6432600607208703
in General Directions. Score plain side of ~C and leave in mold.    1.6432600607208703
Score one side of disk ~D, join to ~C; score other side of ~D    1.7026049541338664
and one side of disk ~E and join as before. While assembled lid    1.67495327387791
is still on design head, gently but firmly press it on plaster board.    1.67495327387791
If design head has a    1.1606783668269585
deep cavity, clay lid will be quite thick at this    1.5636360329510388
point; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' deep into deep clay    1.6065767145351917
to allow vent for proper drying and firing. Check fit of lid on jar;    1.7026049541338664
if inner lid is too big, trim to fit, allowing room for thickness    1.67495327387791
of glaze. Remove lid from head of mold. Remove jar from mold. Place    1.67495327387791
jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly. Bisque fire to    1.7026049541338664
cone 08 with lid on jar.   For an antique effect on jars, brush    1.67495327387791
Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off. Glaze with    1.6432600607208703
two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze. The large jar was brushed    1.67495327387791
with Creek-Turn green toner and sponged off. Glaze with two coats    1.6065767145351917
of matt glazes in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid. When    1.67495327387791
dry they were fired to cone 06-05.    1.3761581156320553
(Made    1.0
from modern wooden molds **f.)    1.1606783668269585
Roll white clay to 3/16'' thickness.    1.2818970554302986
_SALT AND PEPPER:_ Use mold to cut four side pieces. For    1.6065767145351917
top and bottom pieces, use short end of mold as measurement guide. Press    1.67495327387791
the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold. Trim excess clay from    1.67495327387791
rim    1.0
of mold. Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45` angle    1.7269387314284994
to miter corners. Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold;    1.6065767145351917
place design-side up on plaster board. Make all four sides. Cut clay    1.6432600607208703
top and base pieces; place on plaster board. Allow all pieces to    1.6432600607208703
become leather hard before constructing shaker. _TO ASSEMBLE:_    1.4513752902486308
Construct sides, bottom and top as for box, using slip on scored edges    1.67495327387791
and coils of clay to reinforce seams. Join the four sides together    1.6432600607208703
first, then add the base; add top last. Use water on finger to smooth    1.7026049541338664
seams and edges. Turn shaker upside down. Recess base slightly to    1.6065767145351917
allow room for stopper. Cut hole in base for cork stopper. Add holes    1.67495327387791
in top, forming "~S" for salt and "~P" for pepper. Set    1.6065767145351917
aside to dry thoroughly. _SUGAR AND CREAMER:_ Cut a strip of    1.6065767145351917
clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold    1.67495327387791
design. Press clay into cavity of one mold three times; bevel overlapping    1.6432600607208703
ends for splice joint, score beveled edges. Form clay strip    1.5636360329510388
into a cylinder; use slip to join scored ends. Place cylinder on    1.6432600607208703
a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder. Score bottom edge of cylinder    1.67495327387791
and join to disk with slip. Trim away excess clay; reinforce    1.6065767145351917
seam with a coil of clay. This will form the sugar bowl. Make creamer    1.7026049541338664
the same.   Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' wide    1.6432600607208703
and 3-1/2'' long. To add handle, place a wooden dowel against    1.6065767145351917
the inside wall of creamer. Score outside of container where handle    1.6065767145351917
ends will be joined. Bend    1.1606783668269585
handle; press scored handle ends firmly in    1.3761581156320553
place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing; use slip to    1.6065767145351917
join. To form spout, between two designs, dampen area slightly and    1.6065767145351917
gently push clay outward. Make lid for sugar bowl the same as jar lids,    1.7026049541338664
omitting design disk. Cut a    1.1606783668269585
notch in lid for spoon handle if desired.    1.4513752902486308
Set aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl. _VASES:_ Make same    1.6432600607208703
as salt and pepper shakers, leaving off top pieces. Vases may be made    1.67495327387791
into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick. _NAPKIN HOLDER:_    1.6432600607208703
Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each about **f (long    1.7269387314284994
enough for three impressions of mold). Press the two sides into    1.6065767145351917
cavity of one mold three times. Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry    1.7026049541338664
to firm leather-hard state. Score side edges of base; join sides    1.6065767145351917
and base with slip and reinforce with coil. A cardboard pattern cut to    1.67495327387791
fit inside holder will help to prevent warping. Place pattern inside    1.6065767145351917
holder; use three strips of clay to hold in place (see Fig&    1.6432600607208703
2, page 71). Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and    1.748515906000203
would cause breakage.   Let all projects dry slowly for several    1.5636360329510388
days. Clean greenware. Bisque fire to cone 08. Inside of pieces    1.6065767145351917
was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze.    1.6065767145351917
Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged    1.6065767145351917
off to give antique finish. Fired to cone 06-05.    1.5127085093302464
_TO CHANGE FROM ONE COLOR YARN TO ANOTHER:_    1.4513752902486308
When changing from one color to another, whether working on right or    1.6432600607208703
wrong side, pick up the new strand from underneath dropped strand. Photograph    1.6432600607208703
shows the wrong side of work with light strand being picked    1.6065767145351917
up under dark strand in position to be purled. _TO MEASURE WORK:_    1.6432600607208703
Spread article on flat surface to required width before measuring    1.5636360329510388
length at center.    1.0
_TO MEASURE ARMHOLE:_    1.0
Mark row on which first stitches    1.2818970554302986
have been bound off for armhole by drawing    1.4513752902486308
a contrasting colored thread through it. Place work on a flat surface    1.6432600607208703
and smooth out. Measure straight up from marked row. See illustration.    1.6065767145351917
_TO INSERT MARKERS:_ When directions read "~sl a    1.4513752902486308
marker on needle", put a small safety pin, paper clip, or commercial    1.6432600607208703
ring marker on needle. In working, always slip marker from one needle    1.6432600607208703
to another. To mark a row or stitch, tie contrasting thread around    1.6432600607208703
end    1.0
of row or stitch to be marked.    1.3761581156320553
_TO SEW SEAMS    1.0
WITH BACKSTITCH:_ Most seams are sewn with backstitch, especially    1.5127085093302464
on curved, slanted or loose edges. Pin right sides of pieces together,    1.6432600607208703
keeping edges even and matching rows or patterns. Thread matching    1.5636360329510388
yarn in tapestry needle. Run end of yarn through several stitches    1.6065767145351917
along edge to secure; backstitch pieces together close to edge. Do    1.6065767145351917
not draw yarn too tight. See illustration. _TO SEW IN SLEEVES:_    1.6065767145351917
Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center of sleeve cap at shoulder    1.67495327387791
seam. Ease in any extra fullness evenly around. Backstitch seam.    1.5636360329510388
_TO WEAVE SEAMS TOGETHER:_ Straight vertical    1.2818970554302986
edges, such as those at the back seam of a sock, can be woven together    1.7269387314284994
invisibly. Thread matching yarn in tapestry needle. Hold edges    1.5127085093302464
together, right side up.   1.0
HOTEI is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch    1.6432600607208703
a family boat. Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the    1.6432600607208703
helmsman has a clear view. Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves    1.6065767145351917
safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for    1.6432600607208703
three, galley and marine toilet. The gals can sun themselves in the    1.6432600607208703
roomy aft cockpit. All are well distributed, not crowded together near    1.6065767145351917
the stern. And with passenger weight shifted forward, Hotei levels    1.5636360329510388
off for speed under power of a Merc 800. The 80-~hp motor drives    1.67495327387791
her at 25 ~mph with six aboard!   With only two aboard, Hotei    1.6432600607208703
does better than 27    1.0
~mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this    1.5127085093302464
speed even in a three-foot chop. She also banks into a turn like    1.67495327387791
a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all    1.67495327387791
over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser. Nor is she a wet boat.    1.7269387314284994
We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.   1.5127085093302464
{A lot of    1.0
thought} went into storage space construction. There's a large compartment    1.5636360329510388
in the forward cockpit for charts and other items. The cabin    1.6065767145351917
has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for    1.6432600607208703
water skiis, life jackets, etc&.    1.1606783668269585
The aft cockpit has a **f storage bin    1.4513752902486308
over six feet long that doubles as a seat. On each side of the motor    1.7269387314284994
well there's storage for battery, bumpers, line and spare props with    1.6065767145351917
six-gallon gas tanks below. The well itself is designed to take two    1.6432600607208703
Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon    1.67495327387791
long-cruise gas tank below it.   Needless to say, you can't    1.5636360329510388
build Hotei in a couple of weeks. Our building time was slightly    1.6432600607208703
over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom,    1.67495327387791
sink, head and hardware was under $800. A comparable manufactured    1.5636360329510388
boat would cost close to $3,000. Consider what you have to earn to be    1.7026049541338664
able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it. A    1.7026049541338664
Gator trailer, Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways.    1.67495327387791
This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save    1.67495327387791
you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.   All framing    1.67495327387791
in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which, in the dressed state you    1.6065767145351917
buy it, is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings. Therefore,    1.6432600607208703
the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens,    1.6432600607208703
etc&, on a table saw. Besides flathead bronze screws, silicon bronze    1.6065767145351917
Stronghold nails (made by Independent Nail + Packing Co&,    1.4513752902486308
Bridgewater, Mass&) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood    1.5127085093302464
resorcinal glue is used in all the joints.   {Construction}    1.5127085093302464
follows a thorough study of the drawings. Start by laying out the six    1.67495327387791
frames and the transom on a level floor. Draw each outline in a different-color    1.7026049541338664
chalk, one on top of the other. In this way you will be    1.67495327387791
able to detect any obvious mistakes.   The transom frame is made    1.6065767145351917
first with the joints lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No&    1.6065767145351917
12 Stronghold nails. After notching it for the keelson, chines and    1.6065767145351917
battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue    1.6065767145351917
and the same type    1.0
nails. All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets    1.6432600607208703
are glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again using the one-inch,    1.7026049541338664
No& 12 nails. The frames are notched only for the keelson    1.6065767145351917
and the chines. If notched for the battens, they would require more work,    1.67495327387791
be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge    1.67495327387791
water could flow through. Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in    1.67495327387791
contact with the plywood planking.   The jig is erected after the    1.6065767145351917
frames and transom are complete. This is an important step because    1.6065767145351917
any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull    1.5636360329510388
as you advance in construction. Be sure all members are parallel,    1.6065767145351917
vertical and level as required.   After the frames and transom    1.5636360329510388
are set up on the jig and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide    1.67495327387791
mahogany (only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness    1.5636360329510388
is used throughout) is butted between frames one and two below the line    1.67495327387791
of the keelson. The frames are glued and screwed to this piece. The    1.67495327387791
joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated    1.67495327387791
Fiberglas cloth and nailed. It is over this piece that the    1.6065767145351917
laminated stem and keelson are spliced.   The keelson, made of    1.5636360329510388
two three-inch widths, is next installed. The first piece is glued    1.6065767145351917
and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames    1.67495327387791
one and two. The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the    1.7026049541338664
first. Note, however, that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.    1.67495327387791
One-inch, No& 10 screws are used in both cases.   {A stem    1.6065767145351917
jig} is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to    1.6432600607208703
frame one. The stem is laminated from four pieces. Take two three-inch-wide    1.6432600607208703
pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make    1.6432600607208703
the four. Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and    1.7026049541338664
bend them into place on the jig. The first two pieces butt against    1.67495327387791
the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace    1.7026049541338664
between the first two frames. The second two pieces lap over the inner    1.67495327387791
member of the keelson and butt against the outer member. They're    1.6065767145351917
glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson. A number of ~C    1.7026049541338664
clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.   1.6432600607208703
All bottom battens are two inches wide. The side ones are a half-inch    1.67495327387791
narrower. The battens are carefully fastened in place after some    1.5636360329510388
necessary fairing on all frames. Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No& 10 screws    1.6065767145351917
are used. Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks and    1.6065767145351917
front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens.    1.7026049541338664
With the exception of two battens, all run to the stem where they    1.67495327387791
are glued and screwed after careful beveling. The chines go in the same    1.67495327387791
way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength    1.7026049541338664
and easier bending.   Fairing is always a tedious job but    1.5636360329510388
the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple    1.7026049541338664
jig. I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer    1.7026049541338664
with a pair of Sure Grips. The aluminum, flush against the battens,    1.6432600607208703
acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson    1.7026049541338664
to the proper bevels easily. If you don't own a planer and don't    1.67495327387791
want to buy one, it's well worth renting.   {The planking}    1.5636360329510388
is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood. This    1.4513752902486308
can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long. The 42-inch width    1.6432600607208703
leaves very little waste. Four pieces are used. Plank the sides first,    1.6432600607208703
using glue and one-inch, No& 12 Stronghold nails at all battens,    1.6065767145351917
the stem and the transom. Another person inside with a weight against    1.6432600607208703
each batten will help in the fastening. The best procedure is to    1.6432600607208703
have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off.    1.7026049541338664
Then trim the excess. I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter    1.6432600607208703
Cable for this job. It's good for cutting all the planking because    1.6432600607208703
it cuts with a bit-like blade at high ~rpm and does not chatter    1.67495327387791
the plywood like a saber saw.   When cut, the planking is clamped    1.6432600607208703
in place for a final and careful trimming. Then it is marked on the    1.7026049541338664
inside where it comes in contact with the transom, frames, keelson and    1.6432600607208703
all the battens. It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings. The    1.6432600607208703
next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at    1.7269387314284994
the contact points. Then it is replaced and fastened. The bottom planking    1.6432600607208703
is applied in the same manner.   After planking, the bottom    1.5636360329510388
gets a layer of Fiberglas. The spray rails are first glued on the    1.67495327387791
outside and fastened from the inside with screws. Then the chines are    1.6432600607208703
rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation. Since the    1.6065767145351917
sides are also covered up to the spray rails, they are also rough-sanded    1.67495327387791
in that area. The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at    1.7026049541338664
a time. A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line    1.748515906000203
by about three inches. Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size.    1.7026049541338664
Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin. When the resin    1.7269387314284994
has hardened, mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.    1.67495327387791
I used bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding    1.6065767145351917
the hardener. Using a cheap brush, coat one side of the bottom with    1.67495327387791
the resin and then apply the cloth. When the cloth is smooth, apply    1.67495327387791
another coat of resin, spreading it with a paint roller. Be sure it is    1.7026049541338664
well saturated and then allow it to harden.   When the whole bottom    1.6432600607208703
has hardened, use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth    1.67495327387791
at the keel line and near the spray rail. Then lay a three-inch-wide    1.67495327387791
strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of    1.7026049541338664
the stem. Before the resin has hardened, screw a one-inch mahogany keel    1.6432600607208703
strip along the centerline. This protects the bottom in beaching.    1.5636360329510388
Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co&,    1.5127085093302464
1605 W& Elizabeth ave&, Linden, N& J&. They will also    1.5636360329510388
supply literature on application.   {The hull} is now turned    1.5127085093302464
over (with the help of about seven friends) and placed in a level, well-braced    1.7026049541338664
position. I set it on the Gator trailer. I laid three layers    1.6432600607208703
of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing a bow eye    1.7026049541338664
at this time. For added strength, I also fastened a small block on    1.67495327387791
each side of every frame and batten joint. Again, these blocks were    1.6432600607208703
set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.   After trimming    1.5127085093302464
off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them    1.7026049541338664
to the jig at a working height, the top of the side planking is installed.    1.7269387314284994
This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom.    1.67495327387791
These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry. When they're    1.6432600607208703
on, the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.   The    1.6432600607208703
sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from    1.7269387314284994
frame six to the transom, forming a real strong transom brace. Note    1.6432600607208703
another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between    1.67495327387791
these pieces.   The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine    1.4513752902486308
plywood. All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior    1.6065767145351917
fir plywood. Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring.    1.6432600607208703
The exception is where the flooring butts. These battens are glued    1.6065767145351917
and screwed to the frames.   With all deck battens in place, the    1.6432600607208703
bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line. Use one coat of    1.7026049541338664
Firzite and one coat of marine paint. Bottoms of the floorboards are    1.6432600607208703
also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place.   After    1.6065767145351917
the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed. They're followed    1.6065767145351917
by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated. The windshield glass    1.6065767145351917
is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin.   {Inside},    1.5636360329510388
bunks are framed up and installed as indicated. A head is a handy    1.67495327387791
thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the    1.67495327387791
port bunk. The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into    1.67495327387791
the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above    1.67495327387791
the sink. For padding the seats and bunks, I used Ensolite, Type    1.6432600607208703
~M.    1.0
Lightweight, non-absorbent, fire resistant and dimensionally stable,    1.3761581156320553
it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement. Available    1.6065767145351917
in **f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot.    1.6065767145351917
<You can build this vacation cottage yourself. It is a full scale,    1.6432600607208703
small,    1.0
but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete    1.6065767145351917
in every detail. Because of the unique design by the architect Egils    1.6432600607208703
Hermanovski, you can build most of it in your own home workshop    1.6432600607208703
in your spare time. Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials,    1.67495327387791
and requires the use of only simple tools. On the following    1.6065767145351917
pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to    1.7269387314284994
your vacation cottage, from choosing the proper site to applying the    1.6065767145351917
final trim>.   1.0
In recognition of the growing trend for second homes,    1.5127085093302464
or vacation cottages, we have designed this one specifically with    1.5636360329510388
the family handyman in mind. It is a big project, not to be taken lightly.    1.7269387314284994
But each step has been broken down into easy stages, utilizing    1.6065767145351917
standard materials and simple tools, well within the capabilities of the    1.6065767145351917
handyman.    1.0
The idea behind our design is modular units,    1.4513752902486308
or panelization. Everything possible has been scaled to standard    1.5127085093302464
sizes and measurements of materials. Wall panels and structural timbers    1.5636360329510388
are standard as are windows and doors, making for a minimum of cutting.    1.67495327387791
We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so    1.5636360329510388
that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop,    1.7026049541338664
panel by panel, according to plan. Thus, when you have prepared your    1.6432600607208703
foundation and laid the floor, these can be trucked to the site and erected    1.7026049541338664
with a small crew of friends in a weekend. The roof timbers are    1.67495327387791
precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed    1.67495327387791
in a matter of three or four days. Then you can do the finishing    1.7026049541338664
touches at your leisure.    1.0
Due to the fact that building    1.2818970554302986
codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country, the first    1.6065767145351917
thing to do is to find out what, if any, they are. Close to a large    1.748515906000203
city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote    1.7026049541338664
section there might be no restrictions at all. This can usually    1.6065767145351917
be found out at the nearest town hall. At the same time check the electrical,    1.7269387314284994
plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as well as possible zoning    1.5127085093302464
regulations. Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available    1.5636360329510388
or not, check the local customs in the use of bottled or ~L-P    1.67495327387791
gas (we give you alternatives later on). Be sure that this information    1.6432600607208703
is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion. If there    1.6065767145351917
are any major restrictions, they usually can be obtained in printed    1.6065767145351917
form. Where a building permit is required, find out what you must    1.6432600607208703
present when applying for one. In many cases, you must file a complete    1.67495327387791
set of plans with the local building inspector. These will be available    1.6432600607208703
at cost from our Plans Department.    1.2818970554302986
Some general    1.0
things to look for in a site, if you haven't already bought one, are    1.7026049541338664
accessibility, water drainage, and orientation. How are the roads,    1.5127085093302464
and how will they stand up? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;    1.7026049541338664
swampy areas or intermittent springs? A visit in the early    1.5636360329510388
spring after a thaw will be very informative. Note where the sun rises    1.67495327387791
and sets, and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms    1.6065767145351917
come from. Will the view be something you can live with? Don't    1.6432600607208703
worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative    1.67495327387791
foundations later on.    1.0
With this first issue    1.0
we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic (~A    1.7026049541338664
version) and the expandable (~B version). This will be <for the    1.6065767145351917
shell of the house only> (roof, walls, and floor), and does not include    1.67495327387791
the carport or balcony. This will permit you to get a <rough>    1.6432600607208703
estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost. Bear in mind    1.7026049541338664
that this does <not> include interior panels for partitions, fancy    1.5636360329510388
flooring, appliances and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing,    1.4513752902486308
all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.   The    1.67495327387791
wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard **f and **f of    1.67495327387791
a good grade, free from structural faults. They should be as straight    1.6432600607208703
as possible, as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when    1.6432600607208703
the walls are erected. The outside surface of the solid units shall    1.6432600607208703
be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood, plastic coated    1.67495327387791
panel board, high density particle board, asbestos-cement board, or    1.5127085093302464
any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building    1.5636360329510388
supply dealer. The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof, and    1.6432600607208703
the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired. All panel    1.6432600607208703
board comes in standard **f foot size. It is recommended that panels    1.6432600607208703
be both glued as well as nailed to the frame. The fixed window panels    1.7026049541338664
with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass    1.6065767145351917
set in a mastic glazing compound. The louvers are constructed as    1.6065767145351917
shown in the detail, with a drop door for ventilation. There are standard    1.67495327387791
sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels    1.6065767145351917
requiring them. The door panels are designed to accommodate standard    1.5636360329510388
doors which should be of exterior grade. The filler panels for the gable    1.67495327387791
ends are cut from full **f sheets as shown, leaving no wastage. The    1.67495327387791
battens covering the joints are of **f stock and are applied after    1.6432600607208703
the walls are erected. All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is    1.6432600607208703
highly recommended. Note: If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside    1.5636360329510388
and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other, and 1/8-inch glass    1.67495327387791
is used, stock lumber in **f, **f, and **f can be used in making the    1.7269387314284994
glass panels. Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special    1.5127085093302464
size lumber for the glass trim. In any case, there is no special milling    1.7026049541338664
or rabbeting required for the panels.   1.2818970554302986
With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting    1.5636360329510388
tools, fixtures, and attachments available, the drill press has become    1.5636360329510388
a basic home workshop tool. The drill press consists of a vertical    1.6432600607208703
shaft (spindle) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a    1.67495327387791
drill chuck, a tubular housing (quill) in which the spindle is mounted,    1.6432600607208703
a head in which the quill is mounted, a feed lever which moves the    1.7026049541338664
quill up or down, a power source, and a movable table upon which the work    1.7269387314284994
is placed. There is often a means of locking the quill and, on larger    1.7026049541338664
presses, the table can be tilted.   The size of the press is    1.6432600607208703
usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity (the maximum diameter tool    1.6065767145351917
shank it will hold) or distance between the spindle center and the    1.6432600607208703
column. A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center    1.7026049541338664
of a 22 inch board or circle.   A new radial drill press with    1.67495327387791
a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done    1.7026049541338664
at any angle. The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on    1.7026049541338664
the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work.    1.6432600607208703
The drill press should be leveled and, depending    1.4513752902486308
on whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely to a    1.67495327387791
sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws.    1.7026049541338664
This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.   A coat    1.5127085093302464
of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the    1.7269387314284994
polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth    1.6065767145351917
will discourage rusting of the column and quill. Presses not fitted    1.6065767145351917
with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in    1.7026049541338664
the lubrication holes in the quill. The rest of the press should be kept    1.7026049541338664
clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.   Be careful to    1.6432600607208703
keep the drive belt free of oil and grease. Belt tension is adjusted    1.67495327387791
by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount. Keep    1.6432600607208703
the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by    1.67495327387791
hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle    1.67495327387791
bearings. Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises    1.6065767145351917
the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds    1.6065767145351917
the quill in the raised position. The return spring tension may be    1.6432600607208703
adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing    1.5636360329510388
with a pair of pliers (to prevent the spring from unwinding when it    1.67495327387791
is released), loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing    1.6432600607208703
until the desired tension is achieved. Turning the housing clockwise    1.5636360329510388
will reduce tension, counter-clockwise will increase it.    1.3761581156320553
Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide    1.4513752902486308
a socket for the chuck key; otherwise, you'll have to spend    1.6065767145351917
a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the    1.67495327387791
press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the    1.748515906000203
bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not    1.748515906000203
in use.    1.0
Drill speeds are important if you want    1.3761581156320553
a good job. Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed,    1.67495327387791
depending on the material worked. On most drill presses, it is impossible    1.6432600607208703
to get the exact speed, but you can come close by adjusting the    1.67495327387791
drive belt on the step-cone pulleys. You will find a chart giving the    1.67495327387791
various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere    1.5636360329510388
in the instruction booklet that came with the tool. See the table    1.6432600607208703
on page 34 for exact recommended speeds. Generally, the larger the    1.6065767145351917
tool and the harder the material, the slower the speed.   Feed pressure    1.6432600607208703
is also of major importance. Too much pressure will force the    1.6065767145351917
tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed    1.6432600607208703
or broken tools. Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other hard    1.67495327387791
material, causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting    1.6065767145351917
edge. The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed    1.6432600607208703
with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even    1.7026049541338664
rate.    1.0
There are numerous types and styles    1.2818970554302986
of tools to drill holes. The most common are the twist drill, the    1.67495327387791
solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the double spur    1.5636360329510388
bit, and the power wood bit. All will do a good job if sharp, but the    1.748515906000203
twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others, since they    1.6432600607208703
do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual    1.6432600607208703
boring starts.   The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting    1.6065767145351917
large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by    1.6432600607208703
reversing the cutter blade. Since fly cutters are one sided and not    1.6432600607208703
balanced, they should be used at the slowest speed available, and fed    1.6432600607208703
very slowly to avoid binding. Fly cutters can fool you into putting    1.6432600607208703
your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to avoid nicked fingers,    1.7269387314284994
keep your hands well out of the way.    1.4513752902486308
When drilling all the way through a workpiece, always place a    1.6065767145351917
piece of scrap wood underneath. This will not only protect the work    1.6432600607208703
table, but also assure a clean breakthrough. Another method of assuring    1.6065767145351917
a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through,    1.7269387314284994
then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn the piece over,    1.6432600607208703
and finish from the other side. In soft woods with pronounced grain,    1.6432600607208703
there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying    1.7026049541338664
hardness of the wood. In this case, drilling a small pilot hole or    1.67495327387791
clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.   When a hole    1.6432600607208703
is to be bored to a predetermined depth, mark the depth on the side    1.7026049541338664
of the stock, then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark.    1.748515906000203
The depth gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored to    1.7269387314284994
exact and identical depth.   1.0
The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts    1.5127085093302464
are of unusual interest in many respects. For their length, their    1.6065767145351917
types of construction, their picturesque settings, and their literary    1.5127085093302464
associations, they should be known and remembered. In this sequence    1.5636360329510388
I shall write about them in the order of their erection.   The    1.6432600607208703
first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part,- and perhaps    1.67495327387791
the most interesting one, connected Newbury (now Newburyport) with    1.5127085093302464
Salisbury Point. Its building was first proposed in 1791, when a    1.6065767145351917
group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned the General Court    1.5636360329510388
for an act of incorporation. This document began: _"NO&    1.5127085093302464
1 NEWBURY PORT, MAY 30TH, 1791_   "Whereas, a Bridge over    1.5636360329510388
Merrimack River, from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf,    1.5127085093302464
Esquire, in Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury,    1.6432600607208703
would be of very extensive utility, by affording a safe Conveyance    1.6065767145351917
to Carriages, Teams    1.0
and Travellers at all seasons of the year,    1.4513752902486308
and at all Times of Tide.   "We, the Subscribers, do agree,    1.6065767145351917
that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to    1.6432600607208703
this, or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to the Hon'ble    1.67495327387791
General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, praying    1.4513752902486308
for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such    1.6432600607208703
Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge, and a Right to demand    1.67495327387791
a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms,    1.67495327387791
and if such an Act shall be obtained, then we severally agree each    1.67495327387791
with the others, that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares    1.7026049541338664
set against our respective Names, the whole into two hundred shares    1.6065767145351917
being divided, and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times    1.7026049541338664
and in such Manners, as by the said proposed Corporation, shall    1.6065767145351917
be directed and required".   This paper was signed by forty-five    1.5636360329510388
persons, subscribing a total of two hundred shares.   A month    1.5636360329510388
later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that    1.6432600607208703
the bridge was to be built. The matter was considered and reconsidered,    1.6432600607208703
and finally opposed, but in spite of many objections, the Court    1.6065767145351917
granted a charter on January 9, 1792. On November 26 of that year the    1.7026049541338664
bridge was completed and opened.   Timothy Palmer, who invented    1.5127085093302464
and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges,    1.6065767145351917
was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex,    1.6432600607208703
or "Deer Island" bridge although the actual work was carried    1.5636360329510388
out under the direction of William Coombs, who received @ 300 as    1.6065767145351917
recompense.   1.0
This two-part bridge is best described by Rev& Timothy    1.5127085093302464
Dwight, president of Yale College, in his "Travels in New-England    1.5636360329510388
and New-York", published in New Haven in 1821. He says    1.5636360329510388
of it:   "It consists of two divisions, separated by an island    1.6065767145351917
at a small distance from the southern shore. The division between    1.6065767145351917
the island and this shore, consists principally of an arch; whose    1.6065767145351917
chord is one hundred and sixty feet, and whose vortex is forty feet (it    1.7026049541338664
was actually 37 feet) above the high-water mark. In appearance and    1.6065767145351917
construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge. The whole length of    1.5636360329510388
Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four.    1.6432600607208703
I have already mentioned that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport    1.5636360329510388
was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country. As Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Palmer was educated to house-building only, and had never seen a    1.6065767145351917
structure of this nature; he certainly deserves not a little credit    1.6065767145351917
for the invention".   It is hardly necessary to remind students    1.5636360329510388
of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby    1.6432600607208703
Rowley; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was    1.67495327387791
sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect,    1.6432600607208703
Moody Spofford. It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man    1.6065767145351917
who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the    1.6432600607208703
principle of the arch, which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth,    1.6432600607208703
Haverhill, and Philadelphia.   The Essex Merrimack Bridge    1.3761581156320553
when first built was not covered. As far as we know, no American    1.67495327387791
bridge had been thus protected in 1792. Richard S& Allen is the    1.6432600607208703
authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed    1.6065767145351917
by 1810. Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published    1.6065767145351917
in the "Massachusetts Magazine" in May 1793, which is reproduced    1.5636360329510388
herewith (Fig& 1). A brief description accompanying the picture    1.5127085093302464
says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber. Between    1.6432600607208703
the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island    1.67495327387791
there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north    1.6432600607208703
shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of    1.67495327387791
113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.   A    1.7026049541338664
dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place    1.6432600607208703
July 4, 1793, in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island.    1.67495327387791
It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the    1.67495327387791
first share-holders, stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the    1.67495327387791
occasion. The "Essex Journal" says that he "delivered an oration    1.5636360329510388
on the bridge, which for elegance of style, propriety of speech    1.6065767145351917
or force of argument, was truly Ciceronian". The reporter must have    1.6065767145351917
written this with tongue in cheek, because Dexter's oration could    1.5636360329510388
hardly be understood; and, although he later explained that he was    1.6065767145351917
talking French, it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to    1.6432600607208703
the joys of the evening.   The north portion of the Essex bridge    1.6432600607208703
was well worth the cost of construction, although it proved to be twice    1.67495327387791
what was estimated in the beginning. It stood in its original form    1.6432600607208703
until 1882. The southern half, however, on account of its underbracing,    1.6065767145351917
was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation. In 1810 it    1.6432600607208703
was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge. This was built    1.67495327387791
by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette    1.6065767145351917
County, Pennsylvania. Timothy Palmer had general supervision    1.3761581156320553
of the work.   An advertisement in the "Newburyport Herald",    1.5127085093302464
December 21, 1810, shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain    1.7026049541338664
bridges. It reads: _"CHAIN BRIDGES_   "Information    1.2818970554302986
is hereby given that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Mass&    1.5636360329510388
has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the    1.67495327387791
Chain Bridge, in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont,    1.5636360329510388
Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to the sale    1.6065767145351917
of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges.   "Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if    1.6065767145351917
desired will view the proposed site, and lay out and superintend the    1.6432600607208703
work, or recommend a suitable person to execute it.   John    1.5636360329510388
Templeman   1.0
"Approved, Timothy Palmer"   This chain bridge proved    1.3761581156320553
less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end. It fell,    1.6432600607208703
February 6, 1827, carrying with it a horse and wagon, two men and four    1.7026049541338664
oxen. The horse and men were saved, but the oxen drowned. In spite    1.67495327387791
of this catastrophe, the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened    1.67495327387791
again on July 17, 1827. This second chain bridge was 570 feet long,    1.67495327387791
had two thirty-foot towers and a draw, and a double roadway.   1.6065767145351917
The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868, when the County    1.6432600607208703
Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways.   1.5127085093302464
Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous    1.5636360329510388
use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River    1.6432600607208703
at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance    1.6065767145351917
of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site, May    1.7026049541338664
28th to June 3rd. Colonel Frederick W& Lander, impersonated,    1.5127085093302464
will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's    1.6432600607208703
(now College) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel    1.6065767145351917
Benjamin F& Kelley's (West) Virginia Infantry, then swarming    1.4513752902486308
through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.    1.5127085093302464
He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops- thus the    1.6432600607208703
old bridge has another distinction; that of being the first such structure    1.6432600607208703
secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s.   The    1.6432600607208703
bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements, war, fire,    1.6065767145351917
and floods, as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic, for more than    1.67495327387791
a hundred years. Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction    1.67495327387791
by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister.    1.67495327387791
It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the    1.6432600607208703
last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic    1.67495327387791
on U&S& Route 250- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike.    1.5636360329510388
It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving bridge of    1.7026049541338664
its type to serve a main artery of the U&S& highway system, thus    1.67495327387791
it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.   This    1.7026049541338664
covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action    1.6065767145351917
in the early morning of June 3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements    1.67495327387791
of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part    1.67495327387791
and parcel of the war story. So frequently has pictures of the bridge    1.67495327387791
appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the    1.6432600607208703
old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known    1.67495327387791
structures in West Virginia.   Completed and opened for traffic    1.5127085093302464
in 1852, the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth    1.6065767145351917
and his brother, Eli, of Beverly. The Chenoweth brothers were experienced    1.6065767145351917
bridge builders, and against the competition of other, and better    1.5636360329510388
known, bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of    1.5636360329510388
the covered, wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike    1.5636360329510388
a dozen years before, as well as many other bridges for several counties.    1.67495327387791
The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master piece,    1.5127085093302464
with its 139-foot, dual lane, span- and it stands today as a monument    1.67495327387791
to its builders. Never rebuilt, the bridge was strengtened in 1938    1.6065767145351917
by two extra piers, a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper    1.67495327387791
side in order to care for modern traffic.   During the war it    1.6432600607208703
was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the    1.6432600607208703
railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior. Union    1.6065767145351917
soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the    1.6432600607208703
rain or other inclement weather, and some of them left momentoes of their    1.67495327387791
stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.   1.67495327387791
But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened    1.5636360329510388
when Brigadier General William E& (Grumble) Jones reached Philippi    1.5127085093302464
while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May, 1863. General    1.5636360329510388
Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings, including the    1.6432600607208703
long bridge at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses    1.6432600607208703
and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge, he sent his men    1.67495327387791
to work piling combustibles in and around it. Reverend Joshual Corder,    1.6065767145351917
a Baptist minister, gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies,    1.5636360329510388
to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure; he    1.67495327387791
reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or other Confederate    1.5636360329510388
commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat. Jones    1.6432600607208703
relented, he did not order his men to apply the torch- the drove of    1.7026049541338664
livestock was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the mountains    1.6432600607208703
to feed and serve the Confederate army, while Jones and his raiders    1.6432600607208703
turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden.    1.4513752902486308
Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned    1.5636360329510388
to destroy it, after filling its two lanes with hay and straw- but    1.67495327387791
for what reason is not recorded nor remembered, certainly not because    1.6065767145351917
of pressure from an opposing Confederate force. On the second occasion    1.6065767145351917
it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their    1.67495327387791
purpose.   Centering around this historic old structure, a group    1.5127085093302464
of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned    1.5127085093302464
a week-long series of events, beginning on May 28th and continuing    1.6065767145351917
through June 3rd, to observe most appropriately the centennial of    1.5636360329510388
the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.   1.5636360329510388
It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming    1.7026049541338664
pool- eight enlightening, vigorous, rigorous, not wholly unrewarding    1.4513752902486308
years. We have learned a lot- a dash of hydrochemistry here, a    1.6432600607208703
bit about plumbing and pump-priming there. We have had sound grounding    1.6065767145351917
in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy.    1.5127085093302464
We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard    1.5127085093302464
birds. True, our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of    1.67495327387791
our neighbors have built their own pools, thereby diluting our spectacular    1.6065767145351917
attractions. But problems cling to pools, as any pool owner knows.    1.6065767145351917
So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials,    1.6432600607208703
errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the    1.67495327387791
first time- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.    1.67495327387791
Position may not be everything, but in the    1.4513752902486308
case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties, social and/or    1.6065767145351917
physical. We speak from varying viewpoints. One of us has a pool set    1.67495327387791
in a wooded area very near the house. The other has his pool far away    1.7269387314284994
from the house in a field high on a hill.   If you are dreaming    1.7026049541338664
of a blue, shimmering pool right outside your living room windows,    1.6065767145351917
close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of    1.7026049541338664
children, damp towels, squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated    1.5636360329510388
plastic toys. You are likely to be nearer the truth.   You can    1.6432600607208703
also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living    1.7026049541338664
quarters, the greater the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying    1.6065767145351917
noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude. On the    1.3761581156320553
other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children    1.5636360329510388
cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the    1.7269387314284994
pool.   Another dilemma: As picturesque as a sylvan pond in    1.5636360329510388
the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being    1.7026049541338664
of a pool. Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating    1.7026049541338664
lawn every time the grass is mowed.   As in choosing a wife, it    1.67495327387791
is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be    1.7026049541338664
in bad weather as well as in good. In the colder climes, for instance,    1.7026049541338664
you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when    1.6432600607208703
your pool will hardly look its best. It may be a big hole in the ground    1.748515906000203
filled with salt hay, or an ice floe studded with logs. Even a    1.67495327387791
neat, plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold. (We do,    1.6432600607208703
however, recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk-    1.6065767145351917
flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the    1.5127085093302464
pool.)   Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts.    1.6432600607208703
Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and    1.67495327387791
size of your land. But if space and money are no problem and small children    1.7269387314284994
are not on hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have    1.67495327387791
your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs    1.5636360329510388
of the house. And a good several feet around the pool should be neither    1.7026049541338664
greensward nor woods, but good hard pavement.   The placement    1.5127085093302464
of your pool, however, will not of itself solve the two major problems    1.67495327387791
of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining    1.6432600607208703
to safety. Coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself    1.5636360329510388
as well as of your family, neighbors, friends and anyone you ever    1.6432600607208703
talked to on a transoceanic jet.   Eight years ago while we were    1.6432600607208703
going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were    1.4513752902486308
each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings    1.6432600607208703
to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid    1.67495327387791
out nearby for the lord and master's delectation. But not even our    1.6432600607208703
first pool-side    1.0
gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.    1.3761581156320553
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own    1.6432600607208703
backyards. Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled.    1.5636360329510388
Had we taken a lien on a state park? Not at all. We had merely been    1.748515906000203
discovered by the pool sharks. We were in business!   From    1.5636360329510388
proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step-    1.6065767145351917
no more than the change from city clothes to trunks. Nai^ve of us,    1.67495327387791
maybe, but the results of our impulsive invitations to "come over    1.6065767145351917
next summer and swim in our new pool" were both unexpected and unsettling.    1.67495327387791
After the first few weeks, it was    1.3761581156320553
obvious that rules had to be made, laid down and obeyed- even if our    1.7026049541338664
popularity ratings became subnormal as a result. So rules we made,    1.6065767145351917
in unabashed collusion. Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided    1.5636360329510388
precisely, we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single    1.6432600607208703
social code for pool owners.   First and foremost: No one-    1.5636360329510388
no, not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations    1.6432600607208703
to his or her own circle. Just short of forty lashes we finally managed    1.7026049541338664
to coerce our children to this view. Their friends and ours are    1.6432600607208703
welcome to share the pool, but on our terms and at our times.    1.67495327387791
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning    1.67495327387791
beforehand.   No ringers, either- even if they are trailing    1.5127085093302464
legitimate invitees. We want to know when the Potlatches telephone    1.5636360329510388
exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that we won't    1.6432600607208703
end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August.   1.67495327387791
No young children may come without adults except for a specific,    1.6065767145351917
organized, chaperoned party. And accompanying adults are urged to    1.5127085093302464
keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities. A gaggle    1.6065767145351917
of gabbling mothers, backs to the pool, is no safeguard.   No bottle    1.6432600607208703
pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come    1.6432600607208703
to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk    1.7026049541338664
and run. (Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant took    1.6065767145351917
a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood    1.6065767145351917
free-drink stop.)   We designated one day a week as the time    1.6065767145351917
when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours. This has    1.5636360329510388
saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less    1.7026049541338664
brutal to the young "less fortunate" than ours.   We also    1.5636360329510388
worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours    1.6065767145351917
early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco    1.6432600607208703
lunch <en famille>. We gently usher them to an island of tables    1.6432600607208703
and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where    1.6432600607208703
they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.   All    1.67495327387791
dressing (undressing to be more exact) must be done in our small bath    1.67495327387791
house or at the swimmers' homes. (To avoid any possible excuse for    1.6432600607208703
a dripping parade through your house, it is a good idea to have a telephone    1.7269387314284994
extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between    1.6432600607208703
the pool and the parking area.) We do, however, provide a limited    1.6432600607208703
number of extra suits, mainly for children, and we stock extra towels    1.6432600607208703
and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences. Life-preservers, the buckle-on    1.5127085093302464
kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness, too, for the very young.    1.6065767145351917
Safety rules, of course, are more    1.2818970554302986
important than all the others put together.   In many localities,    1.5636360329510388
now, the law requires all pools to be fenced, usually to a minimum    1.67495327387791
height of 5 feet. But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place    1.67495327387791
for running or horseplay. We allow no underwater endurance contests,    1.5636360329510388
either, or inexpert versions of water polo.   Diving boards must    1.5636360329510388
have non-skid surfaces (coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine    1.6065767145351917
and rots quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent). And    1.5127085093302464
divers must be enjoined to look before they leap, either on top of    1.67495327387791
someone else or onto a pool edge.   Our pools also have wide, shallow    1.67495327387791
steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus    1.6065767145351917
be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.   1.67495327387791
All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool    1.6432600607208703
and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.   1.6432600607208703
When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend- for your    1.6065767145351917
own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent. You    1.6432600607208703
should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty    1.67495327387791
pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.   1.7026049541338664
Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen. They are the    1.5636360329510388
result of a constant and careful contest with the elements. Unless    1.6065767145351917
you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your    1.7677783654484436
leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and    1.5636360329510388
feeding- from ~pH content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left    1.6065767145351917
to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service. Of course, if your    1.6065767145351917
pool is close to the house, your wife can always add it to her housekeeping    1.7269387314284994
chores (you hope). Or you can make pool care the price of swimming    1.67495327387791
for teen-agers. Even so, every pool owner, in case of emergency,    1.6065767145351917
should have some idea of what makes things work. A brief course in    1.67495327387791
hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future    1.6432600607208703
crisis.    1.0
A sudden high rise in temperature    1.2818970554302986
will turn your pool poison green overnight. You need more chlorine. The    1.6432600607208703
walls feel slippery. You need algaecide. With or without professional    1.5636360329510388
help, you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself    1.7026049541338664
unless you have a full-time pool nurse.   You should see to it    1.6432600607208703
that the trap, the dirt-catcher in front of the filter, is always clean.    1.67495327387791
A pool is no place for a shut trap.   You should firmly insist    1.67495327387791
that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water. When shed,    1.7026049541338664
they leave rust marks.   You can hope against hope that come spring    1.6432600607208703
cleaning, your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing    1.5636360329510388
and furbishing. It has happened.   Many hours of spring cleaning    1.5636360329510388
will be saved, however, if you remove the main drain grate when you    1.67495327387791
close the pool season in the fall. As the pool is emptied, stand by    1.7026049541338664
to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet. Much of    1.7026049541338664
the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp, but requires dynamite    1.67495327387791
if allowed to dry. If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you may    1.7269387314284994
easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out. Of course, when    1.7026049541338664
your 6-inch torrent of water is released, it may cause a lot of comment    1.7026049541338664
as it passes through or by neighboring properties. Do not forget    1.6065767145351917
this possibility.   If your pool is located on or near sloping    1.6065767145351917
ground, it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable    1.6065767145351917
than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping    1.67495327387791
out the water and then scooping out all the debris.   It may be    1.67495327387791
true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene, but lights also attract    1.6432600607208703
all the insect life for miles around. Once on the water, these    1.6432600607208703
little visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming    1.6432600607208703
problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those    1.6432600607208703
present. Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light    1.67495327387791
you need at much less expense.   Our experience has taught    1.5636360329510388
us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible, from pipes to    1.67495327387791
brushes.    1.0
Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be sure that one    1.6065767145351917
person (in the family or not) is regularly responsible for each aspect    1.6432600607208703
of the job, with no chance for claiming, "It wasn't my turn".   1.6432600607208703
Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves-    1.67495327387791
even if the little boys do want to play space ship. You may find yourself    1.7269387314284994
hitting bottom, literally, as you discover that water is running    1.5636360329510388
out even while you are putting it in.   1.4513752902486308
DRAW a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania.    1.6432600607208703
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning    1.5636360329510388
will be <obsolete in 10 years>. Fortunately, it is the ~FHA    1.6065767145351917
which has arrived at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment    1.6432600607208703
of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and thus acquired    1.67495327387791
with a minimum of financial stress. Even if you live above that line,    1.67495327387791
the ~FHA will back you, for they have decided that the inclusion    1.6432600607208703
of air conditioning in <all> new homes is a good thing and should    1.67495327387791
be encouraged.   New simplified packaged units, recently devised    1.4513752902486308
prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on techniques make    1.4513752902486308
it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as    1.6432600607208703
little as $600 to $900. Two men can often do the installation in a    1.7026049541338664
day. You can install it yourself- this is a central system that will    1.67495327387791
cool <every part> of your house. Its upkeep? No less an authority    1.6432600607208703
than the ~FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes    1.5636360329510388
possible more than offset its operating costs. _IS IT WORTH-WHILE?_    1.5636360329510388
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days    1.6432600607208703
of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted. We know    1.6065767145351917
now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually    1.6065767145351917
desirable, and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.    1.5127085093302464
We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer cooling. On the    1.67495327387791
contrary, there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills. The filtered    1.6065767145351917
air benefits allergies, asthma, sinus, hay fever. Control of temperature    1.5636360329510388
and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid. Heart conditions    1.67495327387791
and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive    1.6065767145351917
heat.   Housekeeping is easier. The cleaner air means    1.4513752902486308
less time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry cleaners, lighter    1.67495327387791
loads for the washing machine. The need for reupholstering, redecorating,    1.5636360329510388
repainting becomes more infrequent. Clothes hold their shape    1.4513752902486308
better, and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.   It    1.5636360329510388
will improve your disposition. When you're less fatigued, things    1.5127085093302464
just naturally look brighter. The children can have their daytime naps    1.6065767145351917
and hot meals, and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.    1.67495327387791
You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed and free of    1.6065767145351917
hot weather nerves.   You can forget about screens, and leave the    1.6065767145351917
storm windows up all year around.   Best of all, central air conditioning    1.6432600607208703
is something you can afford. Like its long-lived cousin,    1.5127085093302464
the refrigerator, a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years    1.67495327387791
or more. That brings its per-year cost down mighty low. _FOR ANY    1.6432600607208703
HOUSE._ No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story, Colonial    1.6065767145351917
or contemporary, central air conditioning is easily installed. The    1.5127085093302464
equipment won't take up valuable space either. It can go in out-of-the-way    1.6432600607208703
waste space.   But there's no denying that the easiest    1.5127085093302464
and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning    1.5636360329510388
is when you build. If that's done, the house can be designed    1.6432600607208703
and oriented for best operation, and this can mean savings both in the    1.67495327387791
size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.   If you    1.67495327387791
can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building,    1.6432600607208703
by all means <make provision for its easy adding later>. Manufacturers    1.6065767145351917
have designed equipment for just such circumstances, and your    1.5127085093302464
savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.   If your    1.5636360329510388
house is to have a forced warm air system, cooling can be a part of    1.7269387314284994
it. This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system,    1.6065767145351917
for your regular heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double    1.6065767145351917
duty for cooling. You can get year-'round air conditioners in the    1.6065767145351917
same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or    1.67495327387791
low boy, horizontal or counterflow. The units can be installed in basement,    1.6432600607208703
attic, crawlspace, or in a closet located in the living area. The    1.6432600607208703
cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet. From the coil    1.6065767145351917
small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set    1.5636360329510388
in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.   If you plan to add    1.6432600607208703
cooling later to your heating system, there are things to watch for.    1.6432600607208703
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.    1.6432600607208703
They may be inaccessible later. <Be sure your ducts and blower are    1.6432600607208703
big enough to handle cooling>. This is especially important if you    1.6065767145351917
live in a mild-winter zone. <Be sure you get a perimeter heating system>,    1.67495327387791
and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for    1.67495327387791
heating.   You can get a hot water system that will also work    1.6432600607208703
for cooling your house. For cooling, chilled water is circulated instead    1.6065767145351917
of hot water. Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating    1.5127085093302464
units, each with its own thermostat. These systems are more expensive    1.6065767145351917
than year-'round forced air systems. The minimum cost for an average    1.6065767145351917
one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to run $1500 above    1.6065767145351917
the cost of the heating alone. _SEPARATE SYSTEMS._ If the problems    1.6065767145351917
of combining cooling with your heating are knotty, it may be cheaper    1.6432600607208703
to plan on a completely separate cooling system. The simplest kind    1.6065767145351917
of separate system uses a single, self-contained unit. It is, in effect,    1.6432600607208703
an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts    1.5127085093302464
to distribute the cooled, cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.   1.6065767145351917
In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be installed,    1.6065767145351917
one serving the living area, the other the sleeping zone. In a two-story    1.67495327387791
house, one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first    1.67495327387791
floor, another in the attic to cool the second. In each case, having    1.67495327387791
separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of    1.6065767145351917
permitting individual zone control. _THE HEAT PUMP._ One of the    1.5636360329510388
more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched    1.67495327387791
to heating. As you know, a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping    1.67495327387791
the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors. A relatively    1.67495327387791
simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine    1.5636360329510388
literally runs backward, and the heat is extracted from outdoor air    1.6065767145351917
and turned indoors.   Up until recently, this heat pump method    1.5636360329510388
of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when    1.67495327387791
outside temperatures were above 40 degrees. Now, the machine has been    1.6065767145351917
improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat    1.67495327387791
at temperatures down to 15 degrees. You can get this added heating    1.6432600607208703
feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.   1.67495327387791
Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost, for those    1.6065767145351917
emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard holds up fuel delivery,    1.6065767145351917
or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start    1.67495327387791
up your whole heating plant. _WHAT SIZE CONDITIONER?_ How large    1.5636360329510388
a cooling unit you need, and the method of its installation, depends    1.6432600607208703
on a variety of factors. Among other things, besides the nature of    1.6432600607208703
your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from    1.7026049541338664
the outside, it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup    1.6432600607208703
of your family. Families with children usually don't want the house    1.6065767145351917
quite so cool. If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity.    1.7026049541338664
The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can easily double    1.7026049541338664
your cooling load.   Cooling requirements are best expressed in    1.5127085093302464
terms of ~BTU's. A ~BTU is a unit of heat, and the ~BTU    1.67495327387791
rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can    1.6432600607208703
pump <out> of your house in an hour. A very rough rule of thumb is    1.7269387314284994
that, under favorable conditions, you'll need 15 ~BTU's of cooling    1.5636360329510388
for every square foot of your house. This is if outdoor temperatures    1.6432600607208703
have a high average of 95 degrees. You'll need more if the high    1.67495327387791
average is above that, less if it's below.   Coolers are also    1.6065767145351917
rated by tons. A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by    1.7026049541338664
melting a ton of ice. By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will    1.6432600607208703
provide 12,000 ~BTU of cooling in one hour.   You may find    1.6065767145351917
a conditioner rated by horsepower. It is generally an inaccurate    1.5636360329510388
method of rating, for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor,    1.6432600607208703
and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll    1.6065767145351917
get. A 1-~hp conditioner, for example, may vary in effectiveness    1.5636360329510388
from under 8,000 ~BTU to well over 10,000 ~BTU.   The    1.5636360329510388
safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit    1.67495327387791
you need, rather than trying to do this yourself.   Don't urge    1.6065767145351917
your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be    1.67495327387791
sure you have enough. Better to have your equipment slightly undersized    1.6065767145351917
than too big. Here's why:   Reducing humidity is often    1.5127085093302464
as important as cooling. An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly,    1.67495327387791
then shut down for a long period. Before it cycles on again, humidity    1.67495327387791
can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature    1.6065767145351917
is still low. With a unit of the right size, a compressor will    1.67495327387791
run continuously during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as it    1.6065767145351917
does temperature. _MONEY-SAVING TIPS._ Attention to details can    1.4513752902486308
cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.    1.67495327387791
A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled    1.4513752902486308
and heated for as little as $128 a year, or $11 a month.    1.67495327387791
If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily, your unit    1.6432600607208703
will have less heat to remove. Keep the direct sun from reaching the    1.67495327387791
house and you've won the first battle. In a new house, generous roof    1.67495327387791
overhangs are a logical and effective solution. If the house you plan    1.6432600607208703
to buy or build won't have big overhangs, you can still do a fair    1.7026049541338664
job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed    1.6432600607208703
trellises, fences and awnings.   Shade trees, too, are a big help,    1.6065767145351917
so keep them if you can. Drawn blinds and draperies do some good,    1.67495327387791
but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.   1.7026049541338664
The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof, the greater    1.6065767145351917
its heat impact. The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence    1.7269387314284994
how much cooling you're going to need. A shift in the walls,    1.6432600607208703
or a change in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely, can    1.7269387314284994
save you money.   You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the    1.6065767145351917
sun, double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation. <Restrict    1.5636360329510388
large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house>.    1.6432600607208703
They're easier to shade there. An attic space above insulation makes    1.6065767145351917
a house easier to cool. You'll even gain by putting your water    1.6432600607208703
heater outside the conditioned space, and using an electric range instead    1.6065767145351917
of a gas one. Gas adds to the moisture load.   Insulate, weatherstrip,    1.6432600607208703
double-glaze to the maximum. In insulation, the numbers to    1.5127085093302464
remember are 6-4-2. They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation    1.6432600607208703
in the ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the floors.    1.7026049541338664
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling    1.5636360329510388
installation, but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in    1.5636360329510388
heating and cooling. A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50    1.6432600607208703
per cent.   It costs two to three times as much to remove a ~BTU    1.7026049541338664
in summer as it does to add one in winter, so every solitary ~BTU    1.7026049541338664
is worth attention. You'll foil them in droves, along with    1.5636360329510388
their pal humidity, by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a    1.67495327387791
bathroom ventilator for when you shower, and an outside vent for the    1.6432600607208703
clothes drier. _KEEPING CONDITIONERS QUIET._ It's no use pretending    1.5127085093302464
that all conditioners are quiet, but the noise they produce can    1.6065767145351917
be kept to a minimum. Good workmanship is important in the installation,    1.6432600607208703
so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award the job on    1.6432600607208703
the basis of price alone.   Avoid attic placement directly above    1.5636360329510388
a bedroom.    1.0
MOST RECREATION WORK calls for a good deal of pre-planning.    1.5636360329510388
This is particularly true in site selection. You must know before    1.6065767145351917
you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you    1.6432600607208703
must have a list of requirements on where, how many, and what type sites    1.7026049541338664
are needed. With such a program you can make constructive selections    1.6065767145351917
of the best sites available.   Begin the examination of a site    1.6065767145351917
with a good map and aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more    1.67495327387791
and more available through the work of counties and other government    1.6065767145351917
agencies. The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal    1.6432600607208703
government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural    1.5127085093302464
features of the site. These are inexpensive and available from the U&    1.6432600607208703
S& Geological Society, Washington 25, D& C&. In recent    1.5127085093302464
years many counties and the U& S& Forest Service have taken    1.6065767145351917
aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning    1.67495327387791
use. Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer    1.6065767145351917
showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office    1.5636360329510388
showing ownerships of land.   Inspect the site in the field during    1.6065767145351917
the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for    1.7026049541338664
recreation. This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the    1.67495327387791
climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the water interests,    1.6432600607208703
etcetera, which vary greatly with the seasons. It is usually helpful    1.6065767145351917
to make a sketch map in the field, showing the size and location    1.67495327387791
of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site. These    1.67495327387791
FOR    1.0
SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified and experienced    1.6432600607208703
park planner to carry through the study. However, there is also much    1.6432600607208703
to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are    1.7269387314284994
available and interested in recreation. County judges, commissioners,    1.4513752902486308
engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a    1.6432600607208703
long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions    1.6065767145351917
to offer from their varied professional experiences. A visit to the site    1.6432600607208703
by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify    1.7026049541338664
opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.   1.6065767145351917
How much study is required? This, of course, depends on    1.5636360329510388
the character of the site itself, the previous experience of the investigator,    1.6432600607208703
and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision.    1.6432600607208703
It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick    1.6432600607208703
judgment    1.0
of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone. Usually    1.7269387314284994
there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions.    1.6065767145351917
A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance    1.7269387314284994
today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little    1.6065767145351917
development or water. The same is true of areas which at first look    1.67495327387791
good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually    1.6065767145351917
be poor areas to develop for general public use.   In looking for    1.6432600607208703
the best sites available that meet the requirements, you need information    1.6065767145351917
to compare the site with others. You need answers to four important    1.6432600607208703
questions.   @ What are the existing recreation features?   1.3761581156320553
@ How well can the site be developed?   @ How useful    1.5127085093302464
will it be to the public?   @ Is this site available?   1.5636360329510388
Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests    1.6065767145351917
already existing at the site. Naturally, a park site with scenic    1.6065767145351917
views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes, will attract more people    1.6432600607208703
than a nearby area with only trees and dunes. Quality is vitally important.    1.67495327387791
Frontage on a body of clear, clean water will be vastly different    1.6432600607208703
from the same amount of frontage on polluted water. Some recreation    1.6065767145351917
features, such as scenic values and water interest, also have greater    1.6065767145351917
overall value than other interests.   One of the most desirable    1.5636360329510388
features for a park are beautiful views or scenery. It may be distant    1.67495327387791
views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a    1.67495327387791
small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual trees. A site which    1.6065767145351917
overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating    1.67495327387791
traffic. An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf    1.67495327387791
rolling in on a beach. A site may also be attractive just through    1.67495327387791
the beauty of its trees and shrubs. Note extent of these interests and    1.67495327387791
how available they will be for the public to enjoy.   Water interest    1.6432600607208703
is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation    1.67495327387791
site. Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas.    1.6432600607208703
This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake    1.6065767145351917
provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation    1.5636360329510388
activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water sports.    1.5127085093302464
A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract    1.7026049541338664
the greatest picnic and camping use. It also cools the air in summer    1.67495327387791
and nourishes the trees and wild life.   The amount of water    1.6065767145351917
frontage, the quantity and quality of the water, and the recreation    1.6065767145351917
afforded by it are important. A restricted frontage may be too crowded    1.6432600607208703
an area for public use. The quantity of water flow may be critical;    1.67495327387791
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant    1.67495327387791
or dry in late summer. If the site is on a reservoir, the level    1.7026049541338664
of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be    1.6432600607208703
studied. Check the quality of the water. A stream which has all of    1.67495327387791
its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation    1.6432600607208703
practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one    1.6065767145351917
passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area. Other    1.5636360329510388
factors, such as water temperature, depth of water, the fish life it    1.6432600607208703
supports, wave action, flooding, etcetera, will affect its recreation    1.5127085093302464
OTHER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest    1.5127085093302464
are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast, beaches, sand    1.5127085093302464
dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera with which the area is blessed.    1.5636360329510388
Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which    1.6432600607208703
are of national or state significance, counties should seek out these    1.6065767145351917
features which are distinctive of their area. Although the site may    1.6065767145351917
not contain the features themselves, there are often opportunities    1.5127085093302464
to include them as additional interest to the site. The route to the    1.67495327387791
park may lead people past them or display views of them. A group of    1.7026049541338664
native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can    1.6432600607208703
be featured at the site.   The fish, animals, and birds which    1.6065767145351917
may be found at the site are another interest. Fishing interest calls    1.6432600607208703
for a check of the species found, quantity and size, the season they    1.67495327387791
are available, and the stocking program of the fish commission. Animals    1.6065767145351917
may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas. The    1.67495327387791
site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its    1.7269387314284994
own resident bird life. Clams, crabs, and other marine life may add    1.6432600607208703
EACH AREA has its own historical    1.2818970554302986
interests with which much can be done. Park visitors are always    1.6065767145351917
eager to learn more about the area they are in. The historical sign    1.67495327387791
tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the    1.7026049541338664
original historical items or places themselves which still have the    1.5636360329510388
character of the period covered. Notice should be taken of unusual rock    1.6432600607208703
formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's crust in your region.    1.6065767145351917
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area    1.6432600607208703
can add geological interest to the recreation sites. An old shipwreck,    1.6065767145351917
a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other    1.7026049541338664
semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera may be of interest.    1.67495327387791
Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian    1.5636360329510388
village sites or hunting areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera.    1.4513752902486308
How well can the site be developed? Look at the physical features    1.6432600607208703
of the land to determine how desirable it is for use, what can be done    1.7269387314284994
to correct the faults, and what it will cost to make the area meet your    1.7269387314284994
needs in comparison to other sites. Many things need to be checked:    1.6432600607208703
factor. An area may be too small for the needs of the project.    1.67495327387791
Areas should be large enough to include the attractions, have ample    1.6065767145351917
space for the use of facilities needed, and have room around the edges    1.67495327387791
to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments.    1.6432600607208703
Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation    1.6065767145351917
areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical    1.7026049541338664
to operate one large area than several small ones.   Shape    1.5636360329510388
of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the    1.7026049541338664
development. A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient    1.6065767145351917
in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width    1.6432600607208703
in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide. This    1.7026049541338664
is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your    1.67495327387791
buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions. However, a    1.6065767145351917
narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide    1.6432600607208703
additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include    1.5127085093302464
scenic strips within the park unit.    1.2818970554302986
of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands,    1.67495327387791
ownership and use of the land, and the utilities available there. For    1.6432600607208703
instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national    1.6432600607208703
forest or a public road, may be desirable, whereas a site next    1.6432600607208703
to an industrial plant might not. The utilities available nearby may    1.6065767145351917
provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the    1.67495327387791
site.    1.0
elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage, rock    1.6065767145351917
outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as subsoil. Nearly level    1.6065767145351917
areas are required for parking areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields,    1.5636360329510388
etcetera. Determine how much topography limits useful area or what    1.5636360329510388
the costs of earth moving or grading might be.    1.5127085093302464
to its recreation interests, water is needed for drinking, sanitation,    1.5636360329510388
and irrigation. The quantity and quality of water sources is    1.5636360329510388
often a big factor in site selection. The area may provide good springs    1.67495327387791
or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines. Figure    1.67495327387791
the cost of providing water to the use areas.    1.5127085093302464
existing plant growth calls for thorough checking. Look at the trees    1.6065767145351917
as to size and interest, the amount of shade they provide, how healthy    1.67495327387791
they are, the problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw,    1.5636360329510388
etcetera.   An area may have been partially logged and requires    1.5636360329510388
removal of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of good landscaping    1.67495327387791
value, other areas of brush may need to be cleared. The extent and location    1.7026049541338664
of open areas is noted.    1.1606783668269585
rain, sun, and temperature affect the use? An area sheltered from    1.6065767145351917
strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use. The direction,    1.6065767145351917
velocity, and season of these winds should be noted as to just how    1.67495327387791
they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation    1.6065767145351917
of the area. Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for    1.6432600607208703
the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable.    1.67495327387791
Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography    1.6432600607208703
or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or    1.6432600607208703
whatever may be most desirable for the use intended.    1.5127085093302464
Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings,    1.5636360329510388
roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera which may raise the cost of    1.6065767145351917
the site.   1.0
Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his    1.5636360329510388
70th Anniversary for the April issue of <Sovietskaya Muzyka> is    1.5636360329510388
accepted with pleasure, because I admire the music of Prokofieff;    1.5636360329510388
and with sober purpose, because the development of Prokofieff personifies,    1.5636360329510388
in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist    1.67495327387791
Republics.   The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the    1.5127085093302464
United States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of pranks    1.6065767145351917
and <bonheur>- and very capable as a professional musician. These    1.5636360329510388
qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic    1.5636360329510388
<haute monde> which supported the concert world of the post-World    1.5636360329510388
War /1, era. Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor    1.4513752902486308
in America was, indeed, brilliant.   Prokofieff's <Classical>    1.3761581156320553
Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted    1.6065767145351917
and well-trained musician still in his twenties. To the Traditionalists,    1.5636360329510388
it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the Neo-Classicists,    1.5636360329510388
it was a challenge to the pre-war world. What was it to Prokofieff?    1.67495327387791
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas; a trial    1.4513752902486308
balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant <piece    1.6432600607208703
de resistance?> Certainly its composer was an ascending star    1.5127085093302464
on a new world horizon.   I heard the <Classical> Symphony    1.5636360329510388
for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927.    1.6432600607208703
All musical Paris was there. Some musicians were enthusiastic, some    1.5636360329510388
skeptical. I myself was one of the skeptics (35 years ago). I remember    1.67495327387791
Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting in his high-pitched voice:    1.5636360329510388
"**h it may be a <tour de force, mais mon Dieu,> can anyone take    1.7026049541338664
this music seriously"?   The answer is, "Yes"! Certainly,    1.4513752902486308
America took Prokofieff and his <Classical> Symphony seriously,    1.4513752902486308
and with a good deal of pleasure. His life-long friend, Serge    1.6065767145351917
Koussevitzky, gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances    1.5127085093302464
in Boston, New York, and Washington, D& C&, to which    1.5636360329510388
he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation. Chicago was    1.6065767145351917
also a welcome host: there, in 1921, Prokofieff conducted the world    1.6065767145351917
premiere of the <Love for Three Oranges,> and played the first    1.6065767145351917
performance of his Third Piano Concerto. "Uncle Sam" was, indeed,    1.5636360329510388
a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war victory    1.5636360329510388
years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations and extravaganzas, enjoyment    1.5636360329510388
and pleasure: "The Golden Twenties". We attended the    1.4513752902486308
premieres of his concertos, symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught,    1.5636360329510388
and performed his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches;    1.5636360329510388
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.    1.6432600607208703
We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as    1.5636360329510388
a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.   1.5636360329510388
Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during    1.4513752902486308
the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western    1.6432600607208703
World- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated-    1.5127085093302464
the <chic> Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich    1.5636360329510388
America- the <avant-garde> Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky,    1.4513752902486308
Cocteau, Picasso- the <laissez-faire> Paris of Dadaism    1.3761581156320553
and ultramodern art- the Paris <sympathique> which took young    1.5127085093302464
composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.   1.5636360329510388
So young Prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland;    1.6065767145351917
in the spacious hunting grounds of "Uncle Sam"; in the exciting    1.6065767145351917
salons of his lovely, brilliant Paris- mistress of gaiety-    1.5127085093302464
excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color,    1.6065767145351917
dance, design, and thought.   Meanwhile, three great terrible    1.4513752902486308
forces were coagulating and crystallizing. In this world-wide conscription    1.5127085093302464
of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled to his    1.5636360329510388
native land. The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts    1.5636360329510388
of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the    1.6065767145351917
Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist    1.5127085093302464
tyranny into cringing submission. After this holocaust, a changing world    1.5636360329510388
occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries, new    1.6432600607208703
treaties and governments, new goals and methods, and the age-old fears    1.6065767145351917
of aggression    1.0
and subjugation- hunger and exposure.   In this    1.3761581156320553
changed world, Prokofieff settled to find himself, and to create    1.5636360329510388
for    1.0
large national purpose. Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune    1.6065767145351917
proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic    1.6065767145351917
order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world.    1.6432600607208703
Here, Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism-    1.5636360329510388
producing music for the masses.   It is at this point in his life    1.67495327387791
that the mature Prokofieff emerges. One might have expected that    1.5636360329510388
such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative    1.6065767145351917
flair of a composer, especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.   1.67495327387791
But no: Prokofieff grew. He accepted the environment    1.4513752902486308
of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his    1.67495327387791
early promise. By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his    1.6432600607208703
people: "I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom, but at    1.6065767145351917
the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the    1.7026049541338664
accepted methods of harmony and melody. This is precisely what makes    1.6065767145351917
lucid, straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must    1.5636360329510388
be new, not old". How right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural    1.7026049541338664
defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not    1.6065767145351917
or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism. And    1.6065767145351917
with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words- with    1.6432600607208703
torrents of powerful music. Compare the vast difference in scope and    1.6065767145351917
beauty between his neat and witty little <Classical> Symphony and    1.5636360329510388
his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth Symphony; or the    1.5636360329510388
<Love for Three Oranges> (gay as it is) with the wonderful, imaginative,    1.6432600607208703
colorful, and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet,    1.4513752902486308
<The Stone Flower>. This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is    1.6065767145351917
the gaiety of dancing people: earthy, salty and humorous.   Of    1.5636360329510388
course, these works are not comparable, even though the same brain conceived    1.6432600607208703
them. The early works were conceived for a sophisticated, international    1.5636360329510388
audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way    1.5636360329510388
of life for fellow citizens. However, in all of Prokofieff's music,    1.6065767145351917
young or mature, we find his profile- his "signature"- his    1.5636360329510388
craftsman's attitude. Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the    1.5127085093302464
cause of experimentation <per se>. In orchestration, he stretches    1.5127085093302464
the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination    1.6065767145351917
for color. His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.    1.6065767145351917
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and    1.6065767145351917
love songs is captivating: witty, clever, adroit, and subtle. His    1.5636360329510388
counterpoint is pertinent, skillful, and rarely thick.   Also,    1.4513752902486308
it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic    1.67495327387791
modulations, the brilliant orchestrations, the adroitness for evading    1.4513752902486308
the heaviness of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint    1.5636360329510388
were not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular historical    1.6432600607208703
dramas of the stage and cinema, where a large, dramatic canvas of sound    1.67495327387791
was required. That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes    1.4513752902486308
seem professionally routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that    1.6432600607208703
he was less of an "original" than we prefer to believe. Need for    1.67495327387791
novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability.    1.5636360329510388
Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero, who, by the force of    1.67495327387791
his creative life, helped preserve the main stream of tradition, to which    1.6432600607208703
the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually    1.5127085093302464
added and integrated.   At this date, it seems probable that the    1.6065767145351917
name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History,    1.6065767145351917
as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware of the lure and danger    1.67495327387791
of experimentation, and used it as it served his purpose; yet    1.6065767145351917
was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics.    1.67495327387791
Certainly, it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared    1.6432600607208703
him to the Western World- not his experimentations.   So    1.5127085093302464
Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a    1.6065767145351917
rich reward from them. Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would    1.6432600607208703
have done better, or even as well, under different circumstances.    1.5636360329510388
His fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not. Why did    1.5127085093302464
Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while Stravinsky (who leaped    1.5636360329510388
into fame like a young giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?    1.6065767145351917
I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words:    1.6432600607208703
"the clarity must be new, not old". When Prokofieff forged his    1.6065767145351917
new clarity of "lucid, straightforward music, so difficult to compose",    1.5636360329510388
he shaped his talents to his purpose.   When Stravinsky    1.5127085093302464
shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons,    1.6432600607208703
many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself    1.5127085093302464
into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures.    1.6065767145351917
Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own    1.67495327387791
people- by the compass of their national ideas. But Stravinsky    1.5636360329510388
was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting. In    1.6432600607208703
all his miscalculations, Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder    1.5127085093302464
of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations-    1.5127085093302464
representing many peoples, time periods and styles- into his own    1.5636360329510388
music by warping the harmony, melody, or form, to verify his own experiments.    1.67495327387791
Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic    1.5127085093302464
materials, and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant <Petruchka,>    1.5127085093302464
his savage <Sacre du Printemps,> his incisive <Les Noces>-    1.5127085093302464
the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical    1.5636360329510388
direction for which his native talents were predisposed.   But    1.5127085093302464
time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear    1.6432600607208703
that he will never find <terra firma>. His various aesthetic postulates    1.6065767145351917
remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself: Supra-Expressionism,    1.5636360329510388
Neo-Paganism, Neo-Classicism, Neo-Romanticism,    1.0
Neo-Jazz, Neo-Ecclesiasticism, Neo-Popularism, and most recently,    1.2818970554302986
Post-Serialism- all competing with each other within one composer!    1.5127085093302464
What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations! Meager    1.4513752902486308
and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty    1.6432600607208703
protagonist;    1.0
a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem (<The    1.4513752902486308
Star-Spangled Banner>); a poor attempt to write an idiomatic    1.5127085093302464
jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes    1.6432600607208703
from his old music might be used for popular American commercial    1.6065767145351917
songs! Stravinsky, nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic    1.67495327387791
bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another, searching for    1.5636360329510388
a home.   How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded. Prokofieff    1.4513752902486308
was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing    1.6065767145351917
world without losing his particular force and direction. In the process,    1.6065767145351917
his native endowments were stretched, strengthened and disciplined    1.4513752902486308
to serve their human purpose.   With a large and circumspect    1.5636360329510388
20th-Century technique, he wove the materials of national heroes and    1.5636360329510388
events, national folklore and children's fairy tales- Slavic dances    1.5127085093302464
and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his    1.6065767145351917
people well, and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large.   1.6432600607208703
Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical    1.6432600607208703
feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind    1.5636360329510388
him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet    1.5636360329510388
companies; choruses, chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings;    1.3761581156320553
broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences. It    1.3761581156320553
must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many    1.6065767145351917
of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic    1.5127085093302464
security and cultural opportunities, incisive idioms, social fermentations    1.4513752902486308
for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large    1.6065767145351917
body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.   Thus    1.5636360329510388
in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced    1.5127085093302464
one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century. That his moods,    1.6432600607208703
even in his early years, are those of his people, does him honor,    1.67495327387791
as his music honors those who inspired it. That he mastered every aspect    1.67495327387791
of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary    1.6065767145351917
judgments, is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous    1.67495327387791
pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;    1.6065767145351917
and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-Century    1.6065767145351917
evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution, based on a broad    1.5636360329510388
Traditionalism for the creative art of music.   1.3761581156320553
April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history-    1.6065767145351917
indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States.    1.6065767145351917
On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund, organized to furnish    1.5636360329510388
employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the    1.5127085093302464
depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes    1.6432600607208703
in the stock market crash, observed its 30th anniversary.    1.5127085093302464
ROY MASON IS ESSENTIALLY A LANDSCAPE PAINTER whose style and direction    1.6065767145351917
has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth    1.6065767145351917
century, especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell    1.5127085093302464
Cotman. And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects    1.5636360329510388
in large, simplified masses which, though they seem effortless, are    1.5636360329510388
in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough    1.7026049541338664
distillation of the natural form that inspired them.   As a    1.5636360329510388
boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the    1.67495327387791
out-of-doors, its tang of weather, its change of seasons, its variable    1.6065767145351917
moods. His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape    1.5636360329510388
painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted    1.5636360329510388
to them his knowledge and love of nature. Out of this background of    1.67495327387791
hunting and fishing, it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects    1.6432600607208703
he knew best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream, ducks    1.6432600607208703
and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of    1.6432600607208703
weather landscape. It is this subject matter that has brought Mason    1.6065767145351917
a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional    1.6432600607208703
performance with this motif that commends him to artists and    1.5636360329510388
discerning collectors.   Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting    1.5636360329510388
himself exclusively to painting. Like many others, he had to work    1.6065767145351917
hard, long hours in a struggling family business which, though it was    1.6432600607208703
allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals-    1.67495327387791
bore no relation to the painting of pictures. But it did teach    1.6432600607208703
Roy the basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for twelve years,    1.6432600607208703
he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia.    1.6432600607208703
On the death of their father, they returned to their home    1.6065767145351917
in Batavia, New York. After more years of concentrated effort, Roy    1.6065767145351917
and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business    1.5636360329510388
at the old stand.   During all this time Roy continued to paint,    1.6432600607208703
first only on weekends, and then, as the family business permitted,    1.6065767145351917
for longer periods. Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether,    1.5636360329510388
and for the past thirty years, he has worked independently as a painter,    1.67495327387791
except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions. But even    1.5636360329510388
on these, the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!   1.6432600607208703
Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey Ryder    1.5636360329510388
who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and    1.6065767145351917
this was limited to a few lessons, though the two artists often went on    1.7026049541338664
painting trips together- Roy developed his art by himself. In the    1.6065767145351917
best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then to draw with accuracy    1.67495327387791
and assurance, and then to paint. He worked in oil for years before    1.67495327387791
beginning his work in watercolor, and his first public recognition    1.5636360329510388
and early honors, including his election to the Academy, were for    1.6065767145351917
his essays in the heavier medium. Gradually watercolor claimed his greater    1.6065767145351917
affection until today it has become his major, if not exclusive,    1.6065767145351917
technique.   It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason    1.6065767145351917
on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia. More often    1.6065767145351917
than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at    1.7269387314284994
a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature    1.6432600607208703
into a composed, not imitative, painting. What I have observed    1.5636360329510388
time and time again is a process of integration, integration that begins    1.6432600607208703
as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color    1.5636360329510388
patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition;    1.5636360329510388
and that over-all, amazing control of large washes which is the Mason    1.6432600607208703
stylemark. Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the    1.6432600607208703
job is done. Inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable-    1.4513752902486308
no!   But for the technical fact, we have the artist's    1.5636360329510388
own testimony:   "Of late years, I find that I like best to    1.6432600607208703
work out-of-doors. First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in    1.5127085093302464
quarter scale (approximately **f inches) in which I pay particular attention    1.6065767145351917
to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest    1.5636360329510388
light, the middle tone, and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms    1.6432600607208703
of my subject to these large patterns. If a human figure or wild life    1.7026049541338664
are to be part of the projected final picture, I try to place them    1.7026049541338664
in the initial sketch. For me, these will belong more completely to    1.6432600607208703
their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though    1.6065767145351917
I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on    1.7026049541338664
the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.   "I am thoroughly    1.6432600607208703
convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects    1.5127085093302464
nature will do his composing for him; as a result, such pictures are    1.67495327387791
only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before    1.67495327387791
him. Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot    1.67495327387791
is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting,    1.7026049541338664
unless the position serves the design of the whole composition.    1.5636360329510388
If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain    1.6432600607208703
units in his design, often only slightly, finer pictures would result.    1.6065767145351917
Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other    1.6432600607208703
objects like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the original    1.6432600607208703
sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they    1.7026049541338664
occupy the right position, which I call 'clicking'.   "Speed    1.5127085093302464
in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity    1.6065767145351917
and crispness, but unless the artist has lots of experience so that    1.6432600607208703
he can control rapid execution, he would do well to take these first sketches    1.7026049541338664
and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.   1.5636360329510388
"If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition,    1.6065767145351917
I mean to project equal concern for color. Often, in working    1.6065767145351917
out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere, a particular    1.5636360329510388
passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be    1.6065767145351917
too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when viewed indoors in    1.7026049541338664
a mat. When this occurs, I make the change on the sketch or on the    1.7269387314284994
final watercolor- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field.   1.7026049541338664
"When working from one of my sketches I square it up and    1.6432600607208703
project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal.    1.6065767145351917
When this linear draft is completed, I dust it down to a faint    1.67495327387791
image. From this point, I paint in as direct a manner as possible, by    1.7026049541338664
flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage.    1.7026049541338664
However, first    1.0
I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and    1.5636360329510388
design along the lines I have described. Then I plan my attack:    1.6432600607208703
the parts I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting of    1.67495327387791
minor details- all in all, mechanics of producing the finished job    1.6065767145351917
with a maximum of crispness. The longer I work, the more I am sure    1.7026049541338664
that for me, at least, a workmanlike method is important. Trial and    1.6432600607208703
error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles    1.67495327387791
in the final painting.   "As for materials, I use the    1.5636360329510388
best available. I work on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently    1.67495327387791
resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue    1.6432600607208703
strain. In my studio I work at a tilt-top table, but leave the paper    1.7026049541338664
unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes. I have    1.7026049541338664
used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English    1.6065767145351917
make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight. After selecting a sheet    1.5636360329510388
and inspecting it for flaws (even the best sometimes has foreign 'nubbins'    1.6432600607208703
on its surface), I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with    1.6065767145351917
clean, cold water. Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that    1.67495327387791
it will lie flat as a board.   "In addition to the usual tools,    1.67495327387791
I make constant use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes,    1.67495327387791
but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to open up lights    1.7026049541338664
in dark washes. The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that    1.67495327387791
it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the    1.7269387314284994
watercolorist. I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large    1.6065767145351917
washes in the studio.   1.0
"My brushes are different from those used    1.3761581156320553
by most watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle. The    1.6432600607208703
red sables are @8; two riggers, @6 and @10; and a very large,    1.67495327387791
flat wash brush. The bristles are a Fitch @2 and a one-half    1.6432600607208703
inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.   "My usual palette    1.6065767145351917
consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna,    1.5127085093302464
raw umber, burnt sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French    1.5636360329510388
ultramarine blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green @2, cadmium yellow    1.5127085093302464
pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's gray,    1.5127085093302464
and ivory black".   In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason,    1.5636360329510388
the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness,    1.6065767145351917
yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration    1.67495327387791
here. True, a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis    1.5127085093302464
of nature rather than a detailed inventory. Unlike many decorative patterns    1.6065767145351917
that present a static flat convention, this artist's pictures    1.5127085093302464
are full of atmosphere and climate.   Long observation has taught    1.5636360329510388
Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes:    1.6065767145351917
a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents    1.6432600607208703
or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the    1.6432600607208703
major motif; and a background, usually a silhouetted form foiled against    1.6065767145351917
the sky. In following this general principle, Mason provides the    1.5636360329510388
observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background,    1.5636360329510388
and the illusion of depth is instantly created.   When painting,    1.5636360329510388
Mason's physical eyes are half-closed, while his mind's eye    1.5127085093302464
is wide open, and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression    1.6432600607208703
he wishes to convey. He does not insist on telling all he knows about    1.7026049541338664
any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw    1.6065767145351917
on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia. It is for this    1.6065767145351917
reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition    1.5636360329510388
of place for their enjoyment. His pictures generalize, though    1.5127085093302464
they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms    1.6065767145351917
of weather, skies, earth, and people. By dealing with common landscape    1.6065767145351917
in an uncommon way, Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American    1.67495327387791
landscape art. Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience    1.5636360329510388
of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor,    1.6065767145351917
a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor    1.6432600607208703
the Creator of it all.   The artist was born in Gilbert Mills,    1.6432600607208703
New York, in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife moved    1.7269387314284994
to California, he lived in western New York, in Batavia. When    1.6065767145351917
I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March    1.7269387314284994
15th, I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for    1.67495327387791
a watercolorist: the water sign of Pisces (February 18-March 20).    1.5636360329510388
And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes, and    1.67495327387791
how appropriate that he should appear in AMERICAN ARTIST again,    1.5636360329510388
in his natal month of March!   Over the years, beginning in    1.6065767145351917
1929, Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold    1.6065767145351917
medals; two Ranger Fund purchase awards; the Joseph Pennell    1.5127085093302464
Memorial Medal; two American Watercolor Society prizes; the Blair    1.5127085093302464
Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute of Chicago;    1.4513752902486308
and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua, New Haven, Rochester,    1.5636360329510388
Rockport, and most recently, the $300 prize for a watercolor at    1.6065767145351917
the Laguna Beach Art Association,   He was elected to the National    1.6065767145351917
Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931    1.6432600607208703
(after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy    1.6065767145351917
in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940. Other memberships    1.5636360329510388
include the American Watercolor Society, Philadelphia Water    1.3761581156320553

The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts    1.6065767145351917
in the 1960 Olympics for one reason- they were better. They were    1.6432600607208703
better trained, better looking, better built, better disciplined **h    1.5127085093302464
and something else- <they were better dancers>. Our athletes are    1.5636360329510388
only just beginning to learn that they must study dance. The Russians    1.6432600607208703
are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.   1.6065767145351917
But why gymnastics at all? And is the sport really important?    1.6065767145351917
After all, we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics    1.67495327387791
competition. But if it is important, what can we do to improve ourselves?    1.67495327387791
It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem,    1.67495327387791
for just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has some very    1.6432600607208703
important things to learn from gymnastics.   Taking first things    1.5127085093302464
first, let's understand the sport called gymnastics. It is made up    1.6065767145351917
of tumbling, which might be said to start with a somersault, run through    1.67495327387791
such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels, backbends, and    1.4513752902486308
culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists    1.5636360329510388
**h and apparatus work. The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a    1.6432600607208703
common sight in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in favor    1.67495327387791
of games. The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard, horizontal bar,    1.5636360329510388
rings, and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball,    1.6432600607208703
volleyball, basketball and football.   But the Russians use    1.4513752902486308
gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because    1.6432600607208703
it provides training in every basic quality except one, endurance. The    1.6065767145351917
gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination, timing,    1.3761581156320553
rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and the desire for perfection.    1.5127085093302464
In short, gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great    1.67495327387791
deal of character as well. The addition of endurance training later,    1.6065767145351917
when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury,    1.7026049541338664
provides that final quality that makes the top athlete, soldier    1.5636360329510388
or citizen.   Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that    1.5636360329510388
it can be started very early in life. (An enterprising teacher or parent    1.67495327387791
<could> start training a healthy child at the age of seven days.    1.6432600607208703
Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries.)    1.5127085093302464
In most sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on the side    1.7269387314284994
of those who begin young, and the Russian competitor of 16 has at    1.67495327387791
least thirteen years of training behind him. The American is very lucky    1.6432600607208703
if he has three.   If a nation wished to get a head start in    1.7026049541338664
physical fitness over all other nations, it would start its kindergarten    1.6065767145351917
students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus    1.6432600607208703
eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools.    1.6065767145351917
First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension,    1.6065767145351917
since action relieves both. Oddly enough, it is proven that there    1.6065767145351917
would be less reading difficulty. Certainly there would be less anxiety,    1.6065767145351917
fewer accidents (it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries),    1.6432600607208703
and higher scholastic averages, since alert children work better.    1.5127085093302464
Russia knows this, and that is why there were over 800,000 competing    1.6432600607208703
for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team. Eighty    1.5636360329510388
thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself. We    1.7026049541338664
could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.   1.67495327387791
And what has dancing to do with all this? A great deal.    1.6432600607208703
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous    1.5636360329510388
training on apparatus. Well-stretched, trained in posture and coordinated    1.5127085093302464
movement, and wedded to rhythm, they presented the audiences    1.5127085093302464
in    1.0
Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic    1.67495327387791
contest. American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons.    1.5127085093302464
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing    1.5127085093302464
with incredible grace. They were further stripped of old wive's    1.5636360329510388
tales    1.0
by seeing the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring    1.5636360329510388
tremendous strength **h and with not one bulging muscle.   President    1.5636360329510388
Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation. If    1.6065767145351917
we wait until children are in junior high or high school, we will never    1.7026049541338664
manage it. To be fit, one has to start early with young children,    1.67495327387791
and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher    1.67495327387791
of dance. If the dance teachers of America make it their business    1.6432600607208703
to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come    1.6065767145351917
some day if our schools are really responsible, we will be that much    1.67495327387791
ahead. School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they must do,    1.6432600607208703
will need demonstrators. There should be youngsters who know how to do    1.6432600607208703
a headstand, and also how to help other children learn it. They should    1.67495327387791
know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for    1.5636360329510388
the sports we will demand be taught.   Dance teachers can respond    1.6065767145351917
to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular    1.5127085093302464
dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes    1.67495327387791
for strength and flexibility.   Very little in today's living    1.5127085093302464
provides the strength we need **h and nothing provides the flexibility.    1.6065767145351917
Dancers do have flexibility. They often fail, however, to develop    1.5636360329510388
real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength. Ask any group    1.6065767145351917
of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results,    1.6432600607208703
considering the amount of physical training they have had, will be    1.6065767145351917
very disappointing. Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.    1.6432600607208703
This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of    1.6065767145351917
the 11-year-old boys in America <cannot chin themselves once>, and    1.5636360329510388
that English school girls outdo them in almost every test (even dashes    1.6432600607208703
and endurance). The only area in which American boys hold their own    1.6432600607208703
is the baseball throw.    1.0
For arm and shoulder    1.0
strength a chinning bar is recommended. It should be installed over    1.6065767145351917
a door that is in full view of everyone, and a chair should be placed    1.7269387314284994
under it, a little to one side. Those children who can chin themselves    1.67495327387791
should be told to do <one> chin up each time they pass under it.    1.7026049541338664
Those who are too weak, should climb on the chair and, starting at the    1.7026049541338664
top of the chin, let themselves <slowly> down. When they can take    1.6432600607208703
ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have the strength to    1.6432600607208703
chin <up>. Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged    1.6065767145351917
to do the same with the whole family at home.    1.5636360329510388
Arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength will be aided with    1.6432600607208703
the Horse Kick. Start on hands and feet. Keeping the hands in    1.6432600607208703
the starting position, run in place to a quick rhythm. After this has    1.67495327387791
become easy, use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher.    1.6065767145351917
Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on    1.7026049541338664
all fours, kicking as high as possible.    1.3761581156320553
Push-ups are    1.0
essential, but few have the strength for them at first. Start on the    1.67495327387791
knees in a large circle. Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let    1.67495327387791
the body down to rest on the floor. Push back up and repeat. Do this    1.7269387314284994
exercise six times each class period. As strength improves start in    1.6065767145351917
a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward.    1.6432600607208703
Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength    1.7026049541338664
improves, fall farther and farther out. Try to push back to the stand    1.67495327387791
position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes    1.5127085093302464
from the hands. The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the    1.67495327387791
<top> of the push-up with legs spread wide. Let the body down slowly,    1.67495327387791
taking at least five seconds for the letting <down>. Five of these    1.6432600607208703
done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-<up>.    1.67495327387791
Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders    1.3761581156320553
have developed at least a minimum of strength. Of course those    1.6065767145351917
who have developed more will find them easier. Start with the class    1.6432600607208703
standing in a circle, with weight on the right foot and the left extended    1.7026049541338664
a little way into the circle. At first each child should do a kick    1.7026049541338664
up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work    1.67495327387791
alone, and those who need help. Drop both hands to the floor and at the    1.7269387314284994
same time kick the right foot up in back. The left will follow at    1.7026049541338664
once. The right will land first, followed by the left. Return to the    1.67495327387791
standing position. Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed    1.67495327387791
on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot    1.67495327387791
is brought as close to the hands as possible. This will prevent flat    1.67495327387791
falls and toe injuries. Bare feet are better for such work than any    1.67495327387791
form of slipper. Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough    1.7026049541338664
so that the teacher can catch the leading leg. The child should    1.6432600607208703
then bring both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten the    1.6432600607208703
seat muscles. Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the    1.67495327387791
hands and that only one foot lands at a time.    1.5636360329510388
The backbend    1.0
is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics, and,    1.6065767145351917
as with all acrobatics, the sooner begun the better the results. Have    1.6432600607208703
the class lie supine with knees apart and bent. Place flat palms on    1.67495327387791
either side of the head a few inches away from the ears, <fingers pointing    1.7026049541338664
toward the shoulders>. Arch the back upwards to make a bridge.    1.6065767145351917
Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor    1.7026049541338664
rather than toward the ceiling. As flexibility improves, the feet will    1.6065767145351917
move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher. Later this can    1.67495327387791
be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover.    1.5127085093302464
To further increase back flexibility, work on the back circle. Have    1.6065767145351917
the class lie prone. Place the hands in front of the chest. Keep    1.67495327387791
the legs straight and the toes pointed. Straighten the arms slowly,    1.6065767145351917
this arches the back. At the peak of the arch, tip the head back and    1.7269387314284994
bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head. Improvement can be    1.7026049541338664
measured by the lessening distance between toes and head.    1.5127085093302464
The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the    1.5636360329510388
somersault, or forward roll. This used to be part of every child's    1.6432600607208703
bag of tricks, but few children can do it today; some are actually    1.67495327387791
incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting    1.6065767145351917
or standing upright. For most small children, learning a forward    1.5636360329510388
roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can. After it has    1.7026049541338664
been seen, have the child start on a mat on hands and knees (a thin,    1.7269387314284994
inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require    1.6065767145351917
falling). He places the hands on either side of the head, keeping    1.6432600607208703
the chin down on the chest. He then pushes his seat into the air and    1.7269387314284994
the teacher guides it over. One or two practice runs should be sufficient    1.67495327387791
for solo. If, however, the child is weak, overweight, or afraid,    1.6065767145351917
more help will be needed. When the child raises his seat into the air,    1.7026049541338664
the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter    1.67495327387791
what happens, the child's performance will be controlled. By lifting    1.5636360329510388
the seat upwards a little, the weight is taken off the neck and    1.67495327387791
the back is kept rounded.   These are beginnings, but correctly    1.5636360329510388
learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed    1.6432600607208703
by a strong, flexible body (we are not talking of eccentric extremes).    1.6432600607208703
Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler    1.6065767145351917
will be a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being with    1.67495327387791
a greater margin of safety in any activity.   It is very important    1.6432600607208703
for parents to understand that early training is imperative. And dancing    1.6065767145351917
school, so helpful in artistic and psychological development, also    1.5127085093302464
contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute    1.5127085093302464
even more.   1.0
EVERY taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual    1.6432600607208703
defense    1.0
budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion    1.6432600607208703
of these expenditures go for military electronics. We have noted how    1.6065767145351917
some electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort, have evenutally    1.5636360329510388
been used in commerce and industry. The host of novel applications    1.6065767145351917
of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because    1.5636360329510388
of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.   1.5636360329510388
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment,    1.5636360329510388
the prospect is staggering. The author has recently studied    1.5127085093302464
the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that, in this    1.6432600607208703
area alone, the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.    1.5636360329510388
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be    1.5127085093302464
greater by far than any previous medical discovery. We use the term    1.6432600607208703
"bio-medicine" because of the close interrelation between biology    1.4513752902486308
and medical research.   Electronics has been applied to medicine    1.5127085093302464
for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine,    1.7026049541338664
the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy machine. Recently many    1.4513752902486308
doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage    1.5127085093302464
of bruises,    1.0
contusions, and simple bursitis.   Commonly used electronic    1.3761581156320553
devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit    1.5636360329510388

along with radiation counters, timers, and similar devices.   1.4513752902486308
In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application    1.6432600607208703
of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this    1.4513752902486308
is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates. From the wealth    1.5127085093302464
of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques    1.5636360329510388
perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which    1.67495327387791
appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely    1.7026049541338664
new tools in medical research.    1.1606783668269585
Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are transparent to visible    1.5636360329510388
light and must be stained for microscopic investigation. This stain    1.5636360329510388
often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.    1.6432600607208703
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure    1.5636360329510388
will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light    1.67495327387791
with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-~TV    1.5636360329510388
system to view the results.   Fig& 1 is a simplified block    1.6065767145351917
diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical    1.5636360329510388
Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute. By combining the    1.4513752902486308
talents of a medical man, Dr& Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr&    1.5636360329510388
Berkely,    1.0
and an electronics expert, Dr& Zworykin, this novel technique    1.5127085093302464
has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding    1.6065767145351917
life processes.   Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet    1.3761581156320553
radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the    1.6432600607208703
three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources.    1.5636360329510388
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the    1.6065767145351917
rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope. Instead    1.5636360329510388
of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the ~TV camera    1.6065767145351917
does the "looking". The microscope and orthicon are both selected    1.5636360329510388
to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that all    1.6065767145351917
lenses must be quartz.   The video signal is amplified and then    1.6065767145351917
switched, in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which    1.5636360329510388
are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of    1.6065767145351917
a second only one wavelength, corresponding to red, green, or blue, is    1.6432600607208703
seen. (Note: Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source    1.5636360329510388
to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated    1.6065767145351917
by a synchronous motor. This assembly also supplies a 20-~cps    1.5636360329510388
switching gate for the electronics circuitry.) This is the same system    1.6065767145351917
as was used in the field-sequential color-~TV system which preceded    1.5636360329510388
the present simultaneous system. Three separate amplifiers then    1.4513752902486308
drive a 21-inch tricolor tube. The result is a color picture of the    1.67495327387791
specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet    1.6065767145351917
wavelengths.   Many of the cells and microorganisms which    1.4513752902486308
are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter    1.6065767145351917
wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum. Different parts of these cells    1.5636360329510388
sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often    1.6065767145351917
possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color.    1.6065767145351917
Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows    1.6065767145351917
or nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation    1.5127085093302464
into a color ~TV picture reveal a wealth of detail.   At the    1.6432600607208703
present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is    1.6065767145351917
primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it.    1.3761581156320553
The medical title of "Lobar Ventilation    1.2818970554302986
in Man" by Drs& C& J& Martin and A& C& Young, covers    1.6432600607208703
a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics    1.7269387314284994
to the study of the respiratory process. At the University    1.5636360329510388
of Washington Medical School, the electronics group has developed    1.5127085093302464
the "Respiratory Gas Analyzer" shown in Fig& 3. This unit,    1.5636360329510388
affectionately dubbed "The Monster", can be wheeled to any convenient    1.5636360329510388
location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's    1.5636360329510388
breathing.   In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder    1.5127085093302464
indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper    1.6065767145351917
and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume of inhalation per breath,    1.67495327387791
the flow of air from both lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes    1.7026049541338664
with respect to each other. Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece    1.6432600607208703
while walking a treadmill, standing still, or in some other medically    1.6065767145351917
significant position. From the resulting data the doctor can determine    1.5636360329510388
lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail.    1.4513752902486308
The original electrocardiograph primarily    1.0
indicates irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques allow    1.5127085093302464
exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta, dimensioning    1.6065767145351917
of the heart and its chambers, and a much more detailed study of    1.67495327387791
each heartbeat. For many of these measurements the chest must be opened,    1.6432600607208703
but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.   1.5636360329510388
A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given    1.6065767145351917
a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques. One simple    1.6065767145351917
method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber    1.7026049541338664
tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change    1.6065767145351917
in resistance as the tube is stretched. A balanced resistance bridge    1.6065767145351917
and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.   1.5636360329510388
Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing    1.67495327387791
small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel    1.6432600607208703
and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy. The travel    1.5636360329510388
time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes    1.7026049541338664
about 16    1.0
|msec& to traverse 25 mm& of tissue. A sonar or radar-type    1.6065767145351917
of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for    1.5636360329510388
body-tissue evaluation. In addition to the heart and aorta, successful    1.5636360329510388
measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique.    1.6432600607208703
The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic signals, can be employed to    1.5636360329510388
measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.   1.6065767145351917
A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining    1.5636360329510388
the effective power of the heart itself. It uses both an ultrasonic    1.6432600607208703
dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor    1.6065767145351917
inserted into the bloodstream. The latter measures the heat carried    1.5636360329510388
away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood    1.67495327387791
flow. It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted    1.6065767145351917
at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left    1.67495327387791
ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself. This pressure    1.6432600607208703
measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning    1.6432600607208703
measurement is made. A simplified version of the instrumentation    1.5127085093302464
for this procedure is shown in Fig& 2. Outputs of the two    1.6432600607208703
systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge,    1.6065767145351917
followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder.    1.6065767145351917
From this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter, pressure,    1.6065767145351917
and effective heart power.    1.0
Several    1.0
years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule    1.6065767145351917
which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal    1.67495327387791
pressure data to external receivers. This original capsule contained    1.5127085093302464
a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm& in    1.6432600607208703
diameter. Battery life limited the use of this "pill" to about 8    1.6432600607208703
to 30 hours maximum.   A refinement of this technique has been described    1.6432600607208703
by Drs& Zworykin and Farrar and Mr& Berkely of the Medical    1.6065767145351917
Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute. In this    1.4513752902486308
novel arrangement the "pill" is much smaller and contains only a resonant    1.6432600607208703
circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing    1.5636360329510388
transducer. As shown in Fig& 4, an external antenna is placed over    1.6432600607208703
or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc&    1.67495327387791
bursts. The energy received by the "pill" causes the resonant    1.5636360329510388
circuit to "ring" on after the burst and this "ringing" takes    1.6065767145351917
place at the resonant frequency of the "pill". These frequencies    1.5636360329510388
are amplified and detected by the ~FM receiver after each burst    1.6065767145351917
of transmitted energy and, after the "pill" has been calibrated,    1.5636360329510388
precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.   One of    1.5127085093302464
the advantages of this method is that the "pill" can remain in the    1.67495327387791
patient for several days, permitting observation under natural conditions.    1.5127085093302464
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are    1.5127085093302464
planned for future experiments.    1.0
One    1.0
of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine    1.6065767145351917
detection is in the exploration of the human body. Our readers    1.6065767145351917
are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent    1.6432600607208703
out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects. Various    1.6065767145351917
methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used    1.6065767145351917
to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water.    1.6065767145351917
In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the    1.5636360329510388
sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques    1.5636360329510388
may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.   1.67495327387791
Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission of    1.5127085093302464
ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels.    1.5636360329510388
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic    1.6065767145351917
signals. Based on this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used    1.6065767145351917
this method to "look through" human organs. A good example of    1.6065767145351917
the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers    1.5636360329510388
presented by Dr& G& Baum who has explored the human eye. He    1.6432600607208703
can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate    1.5636360329510388
blindness due to glaucoma. The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically    1.6432600607208703
is illustrated in Fig& 6. The transducer is coupled to the    1.6065767145351917
body through a water bath, not shown. For display, Dr& Baum uses    1.6432600607208703
a portion of an **f, an airborne radar indicator, and then photographs    1.6432600607208703
the screen to obtain a permanent record.   A typical "sonogram"    1.5636360329510388
of a human eye, together with a description of the anatomical    1.6065767145351917
parts, is shown in Fig& 5. The frequency used for these experiments    1.6432600607208703
is 15 mc& and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy    1.7026049541338664
lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter.    1.5636360329510388
The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan, just like    1.6432600607208703
a radar antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved over a    1.6432600607208703
90-degree arc in front of the eye to "look into" all corners.    1.6432600607208703
The total    1.0
picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector    1.6432600607208703
scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.   Drs&    1.4513752902486308
Howry    1.0
and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied    1.6065767145351917
the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have    1.6432600607208703
obtained extremely good results. By submerging the patient in a tub    1.6065767145351917
and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on, they have been    1.6432600607208703
able to get cross-section views of the neck, as shown in Fig& 7, as    1.7026049541338664
well as many other hitherto impossible insights. As mentioned before,    1.5636360329510388
bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig& 7 the portion of the    1.67495327387791
spine shows as the black area in the center. Arteries and veins are apparent    1.7026049541338664
by their black, blood-filled centers and the surrounding white    1.5127085093302464
walls.   A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in    1.6432600607208703
Fig& 8 with the various parts labeled.   1.3761581156320553
OERSTED'S boyhood represented a minimal chance of either    1.4513752902486308
attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a    1.67495327387791
span of life. He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on    1.7026049541338664
the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August    1.6432600607208703
14, 1777. His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender    1.6065767145351917
income made it difficult to feed his family, let alone educate    1.6065767145351917
them in a town without even a school. The two older boys, Hans and Anders,    1.7269387314284994
his junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home of a    1.67495327387791
warm    1.0
and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German; his wife    1.5636360329510388
taught the two boys to read and write Danish. Other brothers later joined    1.67495327387791
them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic    1.5636360329510388
was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal    1.6065767145351917
curriculum. Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the    1.4513752902486308
boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned, such as    1.7026049541338664
the pastor, to supplement the simple teaching. From the town surveyor,    1.6065767145351917
Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university student,    1.5636360329510388
some academic subjects. The mayor of the town taught them English    1.6065767145351917
and French. Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed    1.5636360329510388
on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the    1.7026049541338664
village. At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in    1.6432600607208703
the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his interest in medicine    1.5636360329510388
and science. His earlier love for literature and history remained with    1.6065767145351917
him for his entire life.   In 1793 the brothers decided to enter    1.6432600607208703
the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following    1.5636360329510388
spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the    1.6065767145351917
autumn session. While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine,    1.6065767145351917
physics, and astronomy, his brother studied law. The brothers continued    1.5636360329510388
to help each other during their studies, sharing a joint purse,    1.6065767145351917
lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of    1.6432600607208703
their aunt. They supplemented their income by small government assistance,    1.5636360329510388
by tutoring and economizing wherever they could. So impressive    1.5127085093302464
were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later    1.6432600607208703
wrote, "to be perfectly free, the young man must revel in the great    1.67495327387791
kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there, in which,    1.6432600607208703
if he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is freedom    1.7026049541338664
of utterance there, which draws after it no irreparable consequences on    1.6065767145351917
society **h. I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day    1.6065767145351917
overcame a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a previous    1.6432600607208703
error". He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing    1.5636360329510388
about science. In this third year at the university, Hans, in 1797,    1.6432600607208703
was awarded the first important token of recognition, a gold medal for    1.6432600607208703
his essay on "Limits of Poetry and Prose". He completed his training    1.6432600607208703
in pharmacy also, taking his degree with high honors in 1797,    1.6065767145351917
and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with    1.67495327387791
a prize for an essay in medicine. He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis    1.7026049541338664
which later was accepted in chemical practices.    1.3761581156320553
HAN'S STUDENT DAYS were at a time when Europe    1.5127085093302464
was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America    1.6065767145351917
and in France, Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms    1.6065767145351917
and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the    1.5636360329510388
Continent.   The new century opened with Oersted beginning    1.4513752902486308
his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen    1.6065767145351917
and as lecturer at the university. He was stirred by the announcement    1.6432600607208703
of Volta's    1.0
discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied    1.4513752902486308
the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis. The following    1.6065767145351917
year he devoted to the customary "Wanderjahr", traveling in    1.5127085093302464
Germany, France, and the Netherlands, meeting the philosophers Schelling,    1.5127085093302464
Fichte, and Tieck. He also met Count Rumford (born Benjamin    1.5636360329510388
Thompson in Woburn, Mass&) who was then serving the Elector    1.5636360329510388
of Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter; these were Oersted's main    1.5636360329510388
contacts in science.   From Go^ttingen (1801) where he stayed    1.5127085093302464
for 10 days, he wrote, "The first question asked everywhere is    1.6065767145351917
about galvanism. As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass    1.6432600607208703
tubes I have invented, I have had quite a small one made here of    1.7026049541338664
four glass    1.0
tubes (in Copenhagen I used 30) and intend to carry it with me".    1.67495327387791
Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks, continuing    1.67495327387791
their correspondence after he left. With Ritter he was exposed    1.5636360329510388
to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's    1.6065767145351917
fertile but disorganized mind. Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes    1.4513752902486308
into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut de France    1.67495327387791
for its annual prize of 3,000 francs. The sound discoveries of    1.6065767145351917
this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize    1.67495327387791
was never awarded to him. In May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight    1.6432600607208703
of fancy, wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.    1.6432600607208703
He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and    1.5636360329510388
indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided    1.6065767145351917
with the years of important electrical discoveries. Thus, 1745 corresponded    1.5636360329510388
to the invention of the "Leiden" jar by Kleist, 1764    1.5636360329510388
that of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser of    1.6065767145351917
Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile. Ritter proceeded, "You now emerge    1.6065767145351917
into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820, you will have    1.748515906000203
to reckon. This we might well witness". Ritter died in 1810 and    1.6432600607208703
Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of    1.7026049541338664
it.   In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for    1.5636360329510388
the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably    1.6432600607208703
considered more a philosopher than a physicist. However, he continued    1.5636360329510388
experimenting and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments    1.5127085093302464
in German and Danish periodicals. In 1806 his ambition was    1.5636360329510388
realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University,    1.6065767145351917
though not realizing full professorship (ordinarius) until 1817.   1.4513752902486308
During Oersted's attendance at the university, it was poorly    1.5127085093302464
equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences.    1.5127085093302464
He was, however, fortunate in his contact with Prof& J& G&    1.6065767145351917
L& Manthey (1769-1842), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to    1.5636360329510388
his academic chair, was    1.0
also proprietor of the "Lion Pharmacy" in    1.3761581156320553
Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him. Manthey maintained a valuable    1.5127085093302464
collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's    1.5636360329510388
disposal during and after his graduation. In 1800, Manthey went    1.5636360329510388
abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy. In    1.6065767145351917
February 1801, Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus    1.5636360329510388
and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates    1.6065767145351917
of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates    1.7026049541338664
of zinc and lead. In the following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously    1.6065767145351917
with Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic    1.6065767145351917
battery more than did salts. Eager as he was to pursue this promising    1.67495327387791
line, he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy    1.6432600607208703
and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university    1.6065767145351917
that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to "galvanizing".   1.5127085093302464
He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and    1.5636360329510388
thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood. The    1.6432600607208703
university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor    1.6432600607208703
represented the upper social level. His broad interest in literary, political,    1.6065767145351917
and philosophical movements opened many doors to him. His friends    1.5636360329510388
were numerous and their ties to him were strong.   The years    1.6065767145351917
1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again, but on this    1.67495327387791
visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his    1.7269387314284994
first journey. In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws    1.6432600607208703
of nature in German and this was issued in French translation (Paris,    1.6432600607208703
1813) under the title <Recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques    1.5636360329510388
et electriques,> a work held in very high esteem by the new    1.6432600607208703
generation    1.0
of research chemists. His interest in finding a relationship between    1.5636360329510388
voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated. Chapter    1.5127085093302464
/8, is entitled "On Magnetism" and in it are included such    1.6065767145351917
remarks as, "One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces    1.6432600607208703
with the electrical forces. The great resemblance between electrical    1.5127085093302464
and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their    1.5636360329510388
laws necessarily would bring about this comparison. It is true, that    1.6065767145351917
nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication;    1.5127085093302464
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those    1.6432600607208703
depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest    1.6065767145351917
difference **h. The form of galvanic activity is halfway between    1.5636360329510388
the magnetic form and the electrical form. There, forces are more latent    1.6432600607208703
than in electricity, and less than in magnetism **h. But in such    1.6432600607208703
an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that    1.6432600607208703
the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity    1.6065767145351917
and magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is    1.6432600607208703
contrary to it **h. One could also add to these analogies that steel    1.67495327387791
loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better    1.6432600607208703
conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.    1.6065767145351917
It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature, as    1.67495327387791
proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb. By that, one feels that magnetic    1.6065767145351917
forces are as general as electrical forces. An attempt should be made    1.6432600607208703
to see if electricity, in its most latent stage, has any action on the    1.7026049541338664
magnet as such". His plan and intent were clearly charted.    1.5636360329510388
Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and    1.6432600607208703
political discussions. In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment    1.6065767145351917
as opposed to dogma, in another he held that the practice of science    1.67495327387791
was in fact an act of religious worship. He continued as a popular    1.67495327387791
lecturer. He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was    1.6432600607208703
caused to glow by an electric current.   In 1819 under royal command    1.6432600607208703
he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm,    1.5127085093302464
one of the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in the expedition.    1.67495327387791
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition,    1.67495327387791
Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light    1.4513752902486308
by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric    1.6432600607208703
current was made to flow. Together they also developed a new    1.6065767145351917
form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of    1.7026049541338664
copper, thereby producing stronger currents. Esmarch was among those    1.5127085093302464
who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery.    1.4513752902486308
THE ASSOCIATION between electric    1.0
(both electrostatic and voltaic) forces and magnetic forces had been    1.5636360329510388
recognized by investigators for many decades. Electrical literature    1.4513752902486308
contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and    1.5636360329510388
had altered the polarity of compass needles. In the late 1700's    1.6065767145351917
Beccaria and van Marum, among others, had magnetized iron by sending    1.6065767145351917
an electrostatic charge through it. Beccaria had almost stumbled on    1.5636360329510388
a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge    1.6432600607208703
from a Leyden jar was sent <transversally> through a piece    1.5636360329510388
of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic. The resulting magnetic    1.5636360329510388
effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.    1.5636360329510388
The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but    1.6065767145351917
no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these    1.5127085093302464
two primary forces. Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive,    1.5127085093302464
possibly because he had, like other experimenters, laid the conducting    1.5636360329510388
wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.   1.5636360329510388
The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains    1.6065767145351917
ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the    1.6432600607208703
university related that the first direct event that led to the publication    1.6432600607208703
of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made    1.5127085093302464
before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820. At    1.67495327387791
this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel    1.6432600607208703
to a magnetic needle.    1.0
Knowing <specifically> what the many feed additives can do and    1.5636360329510388
how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more    1.67495327387791
profitable for beef, dairy, and sheep men.   The <target chart>    1.5636360329510388
quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what. All the additives    1.6432600607208703
listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration    1.6432600607208703
of the federal government. All comments concerning effectiveness    1.4513752902486308
and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary    1.6065767145351917
medical officer with ~FDA.   This article assumes that the    1.5127085093302464
rations you are feeding your beef, dairy cattle, and sheep are adequately    1.6432600607208703
balanced with protein, vitamins, and minerals.   The drug's    1.4513752902486308
chemical name is listed, since most states require feed processors    1.5636360329510388
to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag. In some instances,    1.748515906000203
the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical    1.5636360329510388
name. This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade    1.6432600607208703
name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on    1.6065767145351917
the feed tag.    1.0

per head per day in mineral or salt or feed. For treatment of bloat,    1.7026049541338664
drug is fed at a higher level.    1.3761581156320553
Phenothiazine    1.0
_WHAT IT DOES:_ Reduces losses from stomach, hookworm,    1.4513752902486308
and nodular worms by interfering with reproduction of the female    1.5636360329510388
worm by reducing the number of eggs laid and essentially rendering all    1.6432600607208703
laid eggs sterile. Also, aids in the control of horn flies by preventing    1.67495327387791
them from hatching in the droppings. _HOW TO FEED:_ Treat    1.5636360329510388
cattle with 10 grams per 100 pounds body weight with a maximum of 70    1.7026049541338664
grams per animal. Then, for the above parasites, feed continuously at    1.6065767145351917
these levels: Feeder cattle- 2-5 grams of phenothiazine daily;    1.5127085093302464

Prevents and treats acetonemia (ketosis) in dairy cows. _HOW TO FEED:_    1.6065767145351917
For prevention of ketosis, feed 1/4 pound per head daily for    1.6065767145351917
6 weeks commencing at calving time. For treatment of ketosis, feed    1.6065767145351917
1/2 pound daily until symptoms disappear. Then, feed preventive dose    1.5636360329510388
until 6 weeks after calving.    1.1606783668269585
Promazine    1.0
hydrochloride _WHAT IT DOES:_ A tranquilizer fed to cattle (other    1.5636360329510388
than lactating dairy cows) prior to their being subjected to stress    1.6065767145351917
conditions such as vaccinating, shipping, weaning calves, and excessive    1.5127085093302464
handling. _HOW TO FEED:_ Not less than .75 milligram but not    1.6065767145351917
more than 1.25 milligrams of additive per pound of body weight. _CAUTION:_    1.6432600607208703
Additive should not be fed 72 hours before animals are    1.5636360329510388
slaughtered.    1.0
There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle:    1.6432600607208703
(1) Fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed    1.5636360329510388
is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;    1.67495327387791
(2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot, are filled    1.6065767145351917
by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; (3) Special bunks-    1.5636360329510388
as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides. Feed is    1.67495327387791
put in with an elevator.   Several materials or combinations of    1.5636360329510388
materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk. The selection    1.6432600607208703
of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation,    1.5636360329510388
cost of materials available locally, and your own preference. No    1.5636360329510388
one material is best for all situations. Selecting bunks by economic    1.6065767145351917
comparison is usually an individual problem.    1.2818970554302986
Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk must be twice    1.67495327387791
as long as the mechanical bunk. These bunks also serve as a fence,    1.67495327387791
so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence. Because    1.67495327387791
of their location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks are    1.67495327387791
not in the way of mechanical manure removal. Filling these bunks by    1.6432600607208703
the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the    1.6432600607208703
wagons over more time and operations.   All-weather roads must    1.5127085093302464
be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all    1.67495327387791
year. This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.    1.6065767145351917
MARKETING in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties    1.6432600607208703
will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you    1.5636360329510388
have experienced in the last 20-25 yr&.   Why? Companies of    1.5636360329510388
all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies-    1.6065767145351917
in modern equipment and new processes, enlarged ~R+D    1.4513752902486308
facilities, faster new product development. Many companies have upgraded    1.5127085093302464
their sales manpower and tested new selling, distribution, and promotion    1.5636360329510388
techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.   Given this    1.5127085093302464
kind of business climate, what competitive marketing problems will your    1.5636360329510388
company face in the next 10 yr&? Based on our experience with    1.6432600607208703
clients, we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-    1.6432600607208703
the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing management.    1.5127085093302464
_@ GREATER PRICE-CONSCIOUSNESS._    1.0
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent    1.5127085093302464
years; there is every indication it will continue. Frequently, wittingly    1.5636360329510388
or unwittingly, price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers,    1.4513752902486308
distributors, and dealers. Despite generally good levels of    1.4513752902486308
income, we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling    1.5636360329510388
back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.   1.5636360329510388
Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy    1.67495327387791
will be on target:   Has the probable price situation in    1.5636360329510388
your field been forecast as a basis for future planning? Have cost    1.6432600607208703
studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might    1.67495327387791
be done if things get worse? Have you actually checked out (not    1.6432600607208703
just mentally tested) different selling approaches designed to counter    1.5127085093302464
the price competition problem? _@ INCREASED CUSTOMER SOPHISTICATION._    1.3761581156320553
Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding    1.3761581156320553
product and advertising claims, partly because of widespread criticism    1.5127085093302464
of such assertions. This problem can force a change in marketing approach    1.6432600607208703
in many kinds of businesses. Have you examined this problem of    1.6065767145351917
increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company?    1.5636360329510388
_@ GREATER DEMAND FOR SERVICES._ Need for service is here    1.5127085093302464
to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the    1.7026049541338664
sixties. There are two reasons for this. First, most products tend to    1.6432600607208703
become more complex. Second, in a competitive market, the customer    1.5636360329510388
feels his weight and throws it around.   {Providing good customer    1.5636360329510388
service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning    1.5636360329510388
job as the original selling of the product}. Too often it is    1.6432600607208703
thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.   Good    1.6065767145351917
service starts with product design and planning: Many products seem    1.5636360329510388
to be designed for a production economy, not for a service one. Proper    1.67495327387791
follow-through requires training your own sales organization, and    1.4513752902486308
your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques but also    1.5636360329510388
in good customer relations.   Have you assessed the importance of    1.5636360329510388
service and given it proper attention? _@ WIDER DISCRETIONARY    1.4513752902486308
CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS._ In spending his money today, the consumer is    1.6065767145351917
pulled in many directions. To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type    1.6065767145351917
product- the purchase of which can be switched, delayed, or    1.5636360329510388
put off entirely- the implications are important. Your competition    1.5127085093302464
is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers    1.6065767145351917
in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers    1.6432600607208703
of other appealing consumer products.   Many industry trade    1.4513752902486308
associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share    1.5636360329510388
of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.    1.5636360329510388
Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole "discretionary    1.6065767145351917
buying" area? _@ GEOGRAPHIC SHIFT OF CUSTOMERS._    1.2818970554302986
The trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts    1.6065767145351917
to the Southwest and Far West, and from city to suburbs. These shifts    1.67495327387791
will continue in the next 10 yr&. Have you considered the implications    1.6432600607208703
of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation,    1.5636360329510388
strength of distributor organizations, and even plant location?    1.4513752902486308
_@ MARKET CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN FEWER ACCOUNTS._ We    1.4513752902486308
have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions    1.5127085093302464
in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends.    1.6065767145351917
Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts, there are now larger    1.6432600607208703
sales to or through fewer accounts.   The change may require    1.5636360329510388
different products, pricing, packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising    1.3761581156320553
and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing    1.5127085093302464
network may have to be adjusted. Have you examined these trends,    1.6065767145351917
forecast the effects, and planned your marketing strategy to compete    1.5636360329510388
effectively under changing circumstances?    1.0
_@ MORE PRIVATE LABEL COMPETITION._ In the area    1.3761581156320553
of private label competition, it is logical to expect a continuation of    1.6432600607208703
trends which have been under way during the first decade. As mass dealer    1.67495327387791
and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason    1.5636360329510388
to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the    1.7026049541338664
distributor's profits- which is, in effect, what the sale of private    1.6065767145351917
brands tends to do.   {Average manufacturer frequently has    1.4513752902486308
helped build private brand business, delivering largely the same qualities    1.5636360329510388
and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded}. Moreover,    1.5636360329510388
the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain    1.5636360329510388
stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have    1.6432600607208703
caught on.   If you are up against private brand competition,    1.5636360329510388
have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening    1.5636360329510388
your market position? If private brand competition hasn't been    1.5127085093302464
felt in your product field as yet, have you thought how you will cope    1.7026049541338664
with it if and when it does appear? _@ LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP._    1.6065767145351917
Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through advertising    1.3761581156320553
and promotion, will continue to make strides in the sixties. It    1.6065767145351917
has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program.   1.5636360329510388
How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet    1.6065767145351917
and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are    1.5636360329510388
still important? If you have a higher-quality product, how can you    1.6065767145351917
make it stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken    1.6065767145351917
word? Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different brand    1.5636360329510388
of salesmanship.   Have you carefully examined the selling techniques    1.5127085093302464
which best suit your products? Have you studied the caliber    1.5636360329510388
and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements    1.6065767145351917
for effective marketing? Are you experimenting with different selling    1.5127085093302464
slants in developing new customers? _@ HIGHER COSTS OF DISTRIBUTION    1.5127085093302464
GENERALLY._ Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive    1.5127085093302464
pressure, some by the fact that the customers have come to expect    1.6432600607208703
certain niceties and flourishes. {No manufacturer has taken the initiative    1.5636360329510388
in pointing out the costs involved}.   The use of bulk    1.5636360329510388
handling is continuously growing. Computers are being used to keep branch    1.6065767145351917
inventories at more workable levels. "Selective selling"-    1.3761581156320553
concentrating sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively    1.5636360329510388
by some manufacturers.   There may be possible economies at any    1.5636360329510388
one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain. Do    1.67495327387791
you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully-    1.6432600607208703
and with some imagination? In your sales force, will a    1.5636360329510388
smaller number of higher-priced, high-quality salesmen serve you best,    1.5127085093302464
or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?   1.67495327387791
Will your trade customers settle for less attention and    1.5127085093302464
fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share? In one company    1.67495327387791
covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men, the    1.6432600607208703
president personally phones each major account every 6 mos&. As a    1.6065767145351917
result, distribution costs were cut, customer relations improved.   1.4513752902486308
Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties-    1.5636360329510388
and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study    1.7269387314284994
each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.    1.6065767145351917
_@ HIGHER COSTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION._ From the manufacturer's    1.5127085093302464
point of view, the increasing cost of advertising and promotion    1.5636360329510388
is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties. It is accentuated    1.7026049541338664
by the need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.   1.5636360329510388
How much fundamental thinking and research has your company    1.5127085093302464
done on its advertising program? Are you following competition willy-nilly-    1.5636360329510388
trying to match dollar for dollar- or are you experimenting    1.5636360329510388
with new means for reaching and influencing consumers? Have you    1.5636360329510388
evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion    1.6065767145351917
in your total marketing program- from the standpoint of effort, money,    1.6065767145351917
and effectiveness? _@ INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT._    1.4513752902486308
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products    1.4513752902486308
on the horizon. Will you be out in the market place with some of these    1.7269387314284994
sales-building new products?   If competition beats you to it,    1.5127085093302464
this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store. On    1.6432600607208703
the other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing    1.6432600607208703
the new one is usually mighty expensive. As markets become larger    1.6065767145351917
and marketing more complex, the costs of an error become progressively    1.6065767145351917
larger.   Is your ~R+D or product development program tuned    1.5127085093302464
in to the commercial realities of the market? Are there regular communications    1.6432600607208703
from the field, or meetings of sales and marketing personnel    1.5636360329510388
with ~R+D people? {Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing,    1.5127085093302464
but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register}.   1.5636360329510388
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd    1.5127085093302464
a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable    1.5636360329510388
estimates of sales volume, production, and distribution costs; and    1.5127085093302464
translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which    1.6432600607208703
management can act on with some assurance? We have seen good new    1.6432600607208703
products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts    1.6432600607208703
and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind.    1.5127085093302464
_@ SHORTAGE OF SKILLED SALESMEN._    1.0
There is a shortage of salesmen today. In the future, quantitative    1.6065767145351917
demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy, and    1.6432600607208703
the qualitative need will be greater still.   While many companies    1.5636360329510388
have done fine work in developing sales personnel, much of it has been    1.67495327387791
product rather than sales training. Nor has the training been enough    1.6065767145351917
in relation to the need. Most marketing people agree it is going    1.6432600607208703
to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements.   Have    1.5127085093302464
you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future (both quantitatively    1.6065767145351917
and qualitatively)? Has your company developed selection and    1.4513752902486308
training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen    1.6065767145351917
you will need in the next 10 yr&? _@ SHORTAGE OF SALES MANAGEMENT    1.6432600607208703
TALENT._ With the growing complexity of markets and intensity    1.5127085093302464
of competition, sales management, whether at the district, region or    1.5636360329510388
headquarters level, is a tough job today- and it will be tougher in    1.67495327387791
the future. Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager    1.6065767145351917
are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications    1.6065767145351917
called for by this type of management work. The growth of business    1.6432600607208703
has outdistanced the available supply, and the demand will continue to    1.6065767145351917
exceed the supply in the sixties.   Does your company have a program    1.6432600607208703
for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel    1.5127085093302464
for the longer term? Does your management climate and your management    1.6065767145351917
compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people?    1.4513752902486308
_@ COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING._ Every single    1.3761581156320553
problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning. "Hip-pocket"    1.6432600607208703
tactics are going to be harder to apply. Many food and    1.6065767145351917
beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis. They have    1.6065767145351917
to be. With greater investments in plant facilities, with automation    1.5636360329510388
growing, you can't switch around, either in volume or in product    1.6065767145351917
design, as much as was formerly possible- or at least not as economically.   1.67495327387791
Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently    1.3761581156320553
in your company? We find too many sales and marketing executives    1.6065767145351917
so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning.   1.5127085093302464
Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management    1.4513752902486308
group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the    1.67495327387791
marketing team? Do you have a long-term (5- or 10-yr&) marketing    1.6065767145351917
program?   The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining    1.6065767145351917
your company's marketing problems realistically. Solutions    1.2818970554302986
frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems,    1.5127085093302464
whether they be in the market, in marketing methods or in marketing    1.6432600607208703
management.   If companies will take the time to give objective    1.5636360329510388
consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke,    1.6065767145351917
then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective    1.6432600607208703
marketing in next decade.    1.0
The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior    1.6432600607208703
designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought    1.5636360329510388
clearly into focus one important difference of opinion. The architects    1.5636360329510388
do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently    1.6432600607208703
good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect    1.6065767145351917
and that, therefore, the interior designer is incapable of understanding    1.5636360329510388
the architectural principles involved in planning the interior    1.4513752902486308
of a building.   Ordinary politeness may have militated against    1.5127085093302464
this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance    1.6432600607208703
in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables, workshops    1.67495327387791
or panel discussions- whatever they are called- on this subject    1.5636360329510388
will recognize that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is    1.6432600607208703
education.   It is true that most architectural schools have five    1.5636360329510388
year courses, some even have six or more. The element of public danger    1.67495327387791
which enters so largely into architectural certification, however,    1.4513752902486308
would demand a prolonged study of structure. This would, naturally,    1.5636360329510388
lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior    1.6065767145351917
designer's training.   We may then dismiss the time difference    1.5127085093302464
between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior    1.6432600607208703
design student as not having serious bearing on the subject. The    1.6065767145351917
real question that follows is- how are those four years used and what    1.67495327387791
is their value as training?   The American Institute of Interior    1.5636360329510388
Designers has published a recommended course for designers and    1.5127085093302464
a percentage layout of such a course. An examination of some forty    1.6432600607208703
catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design, for the most    1.6065767145351917
part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of    1.5636360329510388
Schools of Art, and a further "on the spot" inspection of a number    1.67495327387791
of schools, show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations.    1.6065767145351917
One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum, but    1.6432600607208703
the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to    1.6432600607208703
the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.   1.6432600607208703
The suggested course of the A&I&D& was based    1.4513752902486308
on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to    1.7026049541338664
curricular necessities. Obviously, the four year provision limits this    1.5127085093302464
to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.   1.5127085093302464
Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses- architecture    1.5636360329510388
versus interior design- let us examine the educational needs    1.5127085093302464
of the interior designer.   To begin with, what is an interior    1.6065767145351917
designer? "The Dictionary of Occupational Titles" published    1.3761581156320553
by the U& S& Department of Labor describes him as follows: "Designs,    1.6432600607208703
plans and furnishes interiors of houses, commercial and institutional    1.5127085093302464
structures, hotels, clubs, ships, theaters, as well as set    1.5127085093302464
decorations for motion picture arts and television. Makes drawings and    1.5636360329510388
plans of rooms showing placement of furniture, floor coverings, wall    1.5636360329510388
decorations, and determines color schemes.   Furnishes complete    1.3761581156320553
cost estimates for clients approval. Makes necessary purchases, places    1.5127085093302464
contracts, supervises construction, installation, finishing and placement    1.3761581156320553
of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings, and follows    1.5127085093302464
through to completion of project".   In addition to this    1.5127085093302464
the U& S& Civil Service Bureau, when examining applicants for    1.5636360329510388
government positions as interior designers, expects that "when various    1.5127085093302464
needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them.    1.6432600607208703
He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture    1.6065767145351917
of any craft materials needed in the furnishings".   This    1.5127085093302464
seems like a large order. The interior designer, then, must first be    1.6432600607208703
an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and    1.6065767145351917
plumbing and finance. Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this    1.6432600607208703
and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice    1.6432600607208703
it. And further he must understand his obligation to the client    1.6065767145351917
to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve    1.67495327387791
his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.   1.6065767145351917
Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording    1.67495327387791
of their curriculum. It is in the quality of the teaching of all this    1.7026049541338664
that a question may arise.   The old established independent art    1.5636360329510388
schools try their best to fulfill their obligations. Yet even here    1.6065767145351917
many a problem is presented; as in a recent design competition with    1.6432600607208703
a floor plan and the simple command- "design a luxury apartment";    1.6065767145351917
no description of the client or his cultural level, no assertion of    1.6432600607208703
geographical area or local social necessities- simply "a luxury    1.5127085093302464
apartment". Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only    1.6065767145351917
in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may    1.6432600607208703
please the public relations department but have little to do with the    1.6432600607208703
essence of interior design.   It is possible, of course, to work    1.6065767145351917
on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will    1.6065767145351917
explain their necessities so that the student may get "the feel"    1.6065767145351917
of real interior design demands. Unfortunately, the purely synthetic    1.5127085093302464
problem is the rule.   It is like medical schools in India where,    1.6432600607208703
in that fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection of dead    1.5636360329510388
bodies is frowned upon. Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs    1.6432600607208703
of plants. Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense    1.5636360329510388
of actual experience.   In the earlier years of training certain    1.5636360329510388
phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its    1.67495327387791
use. But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.   1.6432600607208703
Consultation with architects, clients, real estate men,    1.3761581156320553
fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development    1.6065767145351917
of class problems just as in actual work. Fortunately, although    1.5636360329510388
only a few years ago they held the student at arms length, today    1.67495327387791
the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student, not only    1.6432600607208703
from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from    1.5636360329510388
the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of    1.6432600607208703
tomorrow- that the student already is "in the trade".   Even    1.5636360329510388
the "history of furniture" can hardly be taught exclusively from    1.5636360329510388
photographs and lantern slides. Here, too, the reality of actual furniture    1.6065767145351917
must be experienced.   The professional organizations such    1.3761581156320553
as American Institute of Interior Designers, National Society    1.4513752902486308
of Interior Designers, Home Fashions League and various trade associations,    1.5636360329510388
can and do aid greatly in this work. Certainly every educator    1.6065767145351917
involved in interior design should be a member and active in thework    1.6432600607208703
of one of these organizations.   Not only should every educator    1.5636360329510388
above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of    1.7026049541338664
the professional organizations, but his first qualification for membership    1.5127085093302464
as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership    1.5636360329510388
would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.   1.5127085093302464
Participation for the educator in this case, however, would have to    1.6065767145351917
be raised to full and complete membership. The largest of these organizations    1.6432600607208703
at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the    1.6432600607208703
conduct and standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even the    1.6432600607208703
right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.   1.67495327387791
This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower    1.5636360329510388
his standing in the eyes of the students. The professor in turn    1.6432600607208703
dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in    1.6432600607208703
the policies and standards of which he has no voice.   This seems    1.6432600607208703
somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications    1.4513752902486308
for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced, the    1.5636360329510388
educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands.   1.6432600607208703
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to    1.6065767145351917
the schools. That is in the continuance of the "grandfather clauses"    1.6065767145351917
in their membership requirements.   When these groups were    1.4513752902486308
first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have    1.5636360329510388
had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were    1.6065767145351917
rare and    1.0
undeveloped during their youth. Long hard years of "on the    1.5636360329510388
job" training had brought them to their competence.   The necessity    1.5636360329510388
of that day has long disappeared. There is plenty of opportunity    1.6065767145351917
for proper education today. It is discouraging for students to realize    1.6065767145351917
that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they    1.6432600607208703
are supposed to stand.   The reason and the day of "grandfather    1.6065767145351917
clauses" has long since passed. No one can deny that these "back    1.6432600607208703
door" admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused    1.5127085093302464
nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents    1.6432600607208703
to membership in supposedly learned societies.   Beyond    1.3761581156320553
any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality    1.6432600607208703
of the teachers themselves. It will occur to anyone that the teacher    1.6432600607208703
must have adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge far    1.6065767145351917
beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication    1.5636360329510388
to his subject and to his students. The local decorator who rushes    1.6432600607208703
in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these    1.7269387314284994
qualifications.   Nor will the hack, the Jack-of-all-trades, still    1.4513752902486308
found in some of the smaller art schools, suffice.   Only a    1.6065767145351917
few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher    1.67495327387791
of interior design. At the end of its letter was the information    1.6432600607208703
that applicants for this position "must also be prepared to teach costume    1.6432600607208703
design and advertising art". This kind of irresponsibility toward    1.5127085093302464
their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude    1.5127085093302464
in the future designer.   We must build a corp of highly professional    1.6432600607208703
teachers of interior design who have had education, experience    1.5127085093302464
in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments    1.6432600607208703
of teaching- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.   1.5636360329510388
Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture,    1.4513752902486308
furniture design, textiles and color is also desirable.   1.4513752902486308
In all "degree" courses in interior design a number of "academic"    1.6065767145351917
or "general studies" courses are included. It is only fair    1.5636360329510388
to demand that teachers of courses in English, history, psychology    1.5636360329510388
and so on be as well informed in matters of art, especially interior    1.67495327387791
design, as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects. The    1.6432600607208703
proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only    1.6432600607208703
if this standard is observed. The matter of sympathy of the academic    1.6432600607208703
professors for art objectives also must be taken into account.    1.5636360329510388
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here. For    1.6065767145351917
proper accreditation of schools, teachers in any course must have    1.5636360329510388
a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.    1.7269387314284994
Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate    1.6065767145351917
work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed.    1.6065767145351917
Indeed, it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable    1.7026049541338664
schools of art have granted degrees at all. The question, however,    1.6065767145351917
cannot be ignored for long. The basic problem involved is that a college    1.67495327387791
setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty    1.6065767145351917
for the advanced degree. Most professors in the course must, naturally,    1.6065767145351917
again have a higher degree than the course offers. One solution    1.6065767145351917
is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute.    1.67495327387791
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it.    1.6432600607208703
This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general.    1.67495327387791
Only the independent art schools, that is, those not connected    1.5636360329510388
with any university or college, receive severe and separate investigation    1.5636360329510388
before accreditation by the various regional organizations. It has    1.5127085093302464
been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation    1.6432600607208703
for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of    1.6065767145351917
their fine arts department. This, plus the habit of many schools of    1.6432600607208703
simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics    1.6432600607208703
department, yet, nevertheless, claiming that they teach interior    1.4513752902486308
design, has contributed to the low repute of many university courses    1.6065767145351917
in interior design. In spite of this, many universities offer adequate    1.6065767145351917
and even distinguished courses in the subject.   There will be    1.5636360329510388
no mitigation of these offences until all art schools, whether independent    1.6065767145351917
or attached to universities have separate accreditation- as do    1.5127085093302464
medical schools- by an art accreditation group such as the "National    1.6065767145351917
Association of Schools of Art".   Independent art schools    1.4513752902486308
granting degrees must, naturally, follow this with academic accreditation    1.5127085093302464
by the appropriate regional group.    1.1606783668269585
How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives    1.5636360329510388
of your benefit and service program? Have you permitted it to become    1.6432600607208703
a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee    1.67495327387791
morale and, consequently, increased productivity?   What    1.2818970554302986
effort do you make to assess results of your program? Do you measure    1.67495327387791
its relation to reduced absenteeism, turnover, accidents, and grievances,    1.5127085093302464
and to improved quality and output?   Have you set specific    1.5636360329510388
objectives for your employee publication? Is it reaching these    1.5127085093302464
goals? Is it larger or fancier than you really need? Are you using    1.67495327387791
the most economical printing methods, paper, etc&. Are there other,    1.5636360329510388
cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted?   1.3761581156320553
Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess    1.5127085093302464
of free "government" work in your plant?   Is your purchasing    1.5636360329510388
agent offering too much free-buying service for employees?   1.4513752902486308
When improvements are recommended in working conditions- such as    1.5127085093302464
lighting, rest rooms, eating facilities, air-conditioning- do you try    1.5127085093302464
to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity?   When    1.5636360329510388
negotiating with your union, do you make sure employees have a choice    1.6432600607208703
between new benefits and their cents-per-hour cost in wages.   1.5127085093302464
Can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those    1.5636360329510388
paid for by profit-sharing money, such as was done in the union contract    1.67495327387791
recently signed by American Motors Corporation?    1.2818970554302986
Do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance    1.6065767145351917
entitles them? Are they encouraged to take full legal advantage    1.5636360329510388
of these benefits? Have you publicized the cents-per-hour value    1.5127085093302464
of the company's share of insurance premiums?   When did you    1.5636360329510388
last compare your present premium costs with the costs of insurance    1.6065767145351917
from other sources?   Can your insurance company aid you in reducing    1.6065767145351917
administrative costs?   Do you try to maintain the principle    1.5127085093302464
of employee-contributed (as opposed to fully company-paid) programs?    1.4513752902486308
Do you protect your holiday    1.1606783668269585
privileges with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday?   1.6065767145351917
Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area and/or    1.5636360329510388
industrial patterns?   Have you investigated the possibility    1.3761581156320553
of moving midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday in    1.6432600607208703
order to have an uninterrupted work week?   Are you carefully    1.5636360329510388
policing wash-up time and rest periods to be certain that all other time    1.67495327387791
is productive?   Are you watching work schedules for boiler    1.5127085093302464
operators, guards, and other 24-hour-day, 7-day-week operations in order    1.5127085093302464
to minimize overtime?   Are you careful to restrict the number    1.5636360329510388
of people on leave at one time so that your total employment obligation    1.67495327387791
is minimized?    1.0
Have you considered    1.0
using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria    1.6065767145351917
employees?   What are the possibilities for operating your    1.4513752902486308
cafeteria for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines    1.6065767145351917
or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift operations?   1.5127085093302464
Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria    1.5127085093302464
operation in order to save administrative costs?   Are there    1.5127085093302464
possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or    1.5636360329510388
other jobs?   Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity    1.5127085093302464
strain on your feeding facilities?   Would it be feasible to    1.5636360329510388
limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs?   Have you considered    1.6432600607208703
gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation?   1.5127085093302464
Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings    1.4513752902486308
or discussions?    1.0
Are your expenses in    1.0
this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from    1.6065767145351917
your program?   Have you audited your program recently to weed    1.5636360329510388
out those phases that draw least participation?   Do employees    1.5127085093302464
contribute their share of money to recreational facilities?    1.4513752902486308
Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee    1.5127085093302464
association and carefully restricting your plant's financial    1.3761581156320553
contribution?   Could an employee's garden club take over partial    1.5127085093302464
care of plant grounds? Would a camera club be useful in taking    1.6432600607208703
pictures pertinent to plant safety?   Are you spending too much    1.5636360329510388
money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees? Are you    1.6432600607208703
underwriting expensive team trips?   Are you utilizing vending    1.4513752902486308
machine proceeds to help pay for your program?    1.4513752902486308
Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access    1.6065767145351917
roads and parking lots?   If you use parking attendants, can    1.5636360329510388
they be replaced by automatic parking gates?   Will your local    1.5636360329510388
bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant?   1.6065767145351917
If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this be replaced    1.5127085093302464
by available public transportation? If you use company transportation    1.5127085093302464
to meet trains or to haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?   1.6065767145351917
How efficient and necessary are your intra-company vehicles? Can    1.5127085093302464
they be re-scheduled? Can part-time drivers be assigned to other    1.5636360329510388
productive work?    1.0
Which is more economical for    1.1606783668269585
your plant- a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra    1.6065767145351917
employees for vacation fill-ins?   Can vacations be spaced    1.4513752902486308
throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?   1.6065767145351917
Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations    1.5636360329510388
during plant shutdowns?   What can your sales and purchasing    1.5127085093302464
departments do to curtail orders, shipments, and receipts during vacation    1.5636360329510388
shutdown periods?    1.0
Is an arbitrary retirement    1.0
age of 65 actually costing your plant money?   What sort of    1.6065767145351917
effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully    1.67495327387791
productive? Would early retirement of non-productive, disabled employees    1.4513752902486308
reduce the number of make-work jobs?   Will your union    1.5127085093302464
accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees?    1.6065767145351917
Can you share medical facilities    1.1606783668269585
and staff with neighboring plants?   If you have a full-time    1.5636360329510388
doctor now, can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves    1.7026049541338664
on a fee-per-case basis only?   Can your plant nurse be replaced    1.6065767145351917
by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment?   1.6432600607208703
Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected    1.4513752902486308
health problems and avoid treating the latter?   Are    1.4513752902486308
you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services- flu shots,    1.4513752902486308
sun lamp treatments, etc&?   If you have an annual or regular    1.6065767145351917
physical examination program, is it worth what it is costing you?    1.6065767145351917
Consider what you can afford    1.1606783668269585
to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee    1.7026049541338664
benefit program. Too many plant officials are all too eager to    1.6065767145351917
buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works    1.6432600607208703
for another plant.   But even if that other plant employs the    1.6065767145351917
same number of workers and makes the same product, there are other facts    1.67495327387791
to consider. How old is your working force? What's your profit    1.6065767145351917
margin? In what section of the country are you located? Are    1.6065767145351917
you in a rural or urban area? These factors can make the difference    1.67495327387791
between waste and efficiency in any benefit program.   Above all,    1.5636360329510388
don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good    1.6065767145351917
will. Unions stress fringe benefits, but the individual hourly worker    1.5636360329510388
prefers cash every time.   Aim to balance your employee benefit    1.5636360329510388
package. Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal    1.67495327387791
retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere. They're    1.4513752902486308
asking for union trouble.    1.0
If you want credit    1.0
for your employee services program, let your workers know what they're    1.6065767145351917
entitled to. Encourage them to exercise their benefits. This    1.5127085093302464
can be done by stories in your house organs, posters, special    1.6065767145351917
publications, letters to workers' homes as well as    1.4513752902486308
by word of mouth through your chain of command.   Some companies    1.6065767145351917
find a little imagination helpful. Hallmark Cards, Inc&, Kansas    1.5127085093302464
City, Mo&, has a do-it-yourself quiz game called "Benefit Bafflers",    1.5636360329510388
which it distributes to employees. ~M + ~R Dietetic Laboratories,    1.5127085093302464
Inc&, Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook-    1.5127085093302464
each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular    1.6065767145351917
fringe. U& S& Rubber Company, New York, passes out a form    1.6065767145351917
itemizing the value of benefits. The blue-collar worker thus knows    1.5636360329510388
his insurance package, for example, costs $227.72.    1.3761581156320553
Have    1.0
the insurance company or your own accounting department break down    1.5636360329510388
the cost of your insurance package periodically. You may find certain    1.6065767145351917
coverage costing much more than is economically feasible, thereby alerting    1.5636360329510388
you to desirable revisions.   Check to see if some of your    1.6065767145351917
benefits- such as on-the-job disability pay- can be put on a direct    1.6432600607208703
payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you.    1.6065767145351917
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible. It can put an end to marginal    1.6432600607208703
claims which play havoc with your insurance rates. Also, beware    1.5636360329510388
of open-end policies, especially in the medical field. This will mean    1.6065767145351917
that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will    1.6432600607208703
go up in like manner. Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits.   1.6065767145351917
Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death.    1.6065767145351917
Generally, your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that    1.4513752902486308
protect him during his working life or during retirement.    1.5127085093302464
In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off    1.5127085093302464
and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify.    1.67495327387791
Thus, you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth    1.6432600607208703
cousin's funeral. Also, reserve the right to demand proof of    1.5636360329510388
death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it.   Coffee    1.6065767145351917
breaks can be a real headache if not regulated. Vending machines    1.6065767145351917
can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting    1.67495327387791
waste of production time. If coffee is sold at the cafeteria,    1.6065767145351917
let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group. Consider    1.7026049541338664
installing supplemental serving lines in production areas. Make    1.4513752902486308
sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers,    1.67495327387791
if you are supplying the coffee. Otherwise, you may be saddled    1.6065767145351917
with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers.    1.4513752902486308
Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool    1.6065767145351917
and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company.    1.7269387314284994
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest    1.67495327387791
possible age. Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements    1.6065767145351917
tied into your pension plan. Younger men usually don't think    1.5636360329510388
of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're    1.6065767145351917
liable to change jobs several times before settling down.   Choose    1.5636360329510388
carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans.    1.3761581156320553
There are two sides of a coin for this decision. Workers usually think    1.67495327387791
more of a plan they contribute to. And they can at least collect    1.67495327387791
the money they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company. A    1.67495327387791
non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he    1.6065767145351917
retires. Thus, there is an added incentive to stay on the job.    1.6432600607208703
Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee    1.6432600607208703
would not otherwise be working. These include: leaves of absences,    1.5636360329510388
illnesses, and layoffs.   Consider adopting a system of holidays    1.5127085093302464
in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience    1.6432600607208703
to the operation of the plant. It's usually not too hard to sell    1.67495327387791
workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods. For example,    1.6432600607208703
the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's    1.5127085093302464
birthday. This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and    1.5636360329510388
startups.   Require each employee to work his last shift both    1.5636360329510388
before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay. This cuts the absentee    1.7026049541338664
rate.    1.0
Consider using vending machines    1.0
rather than subsidized cafeterias. Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable    1.6065767145351917
prices, and at a profit to you. If a concessionaire runs the    1.6432600607208703
cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price. If the soup tastes    1.67495327387791
like dishwater, your employees won't blame the concessionaire. You'll    1.5127085093302464
take the rap.   Check your cafeteria location to make sure    1.5636360329510388
it's convenient for most employees. You may save valuable production    1.5636360329510388
minutes with a change.    1.0
Spread your vacation period    1.0
over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two    1.7026049541338664
weeks. This will cut the expense of vacation replacements. And with    1.6065767145351917
the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice    1.7026049541338664
vacation dates.   Also make sure you have reasonable requirements    1.5127085093302464
as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a    1.6432600607208703
vacation. You might try providing standard vacation time off but make    1.6065767145351917
the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous    1.67495327387791
year.    1.0
THE LONG and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into    1.6065767145351917
a new era. Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition.    1.6065767145351917
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away. But with    1.67495327387791
all the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain- a few things remain    1.6432600607208703
constant, including the devotion of Americans to the great field    1.5636360329510388
sports, hunting and fishing.   As the generations move on, clothes    1.5636360329510388
become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports. Sporting    1.5636360329510388
firearms change, markedly for the better. Just as modern transportation    1.5636360329510388
has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon, the demand of    1.5636360329510388
today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.   1.5636360329510388
The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through    1.3761581156320553
diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle    1.5127085093302464
loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders,    1.5636360329510388
extremely accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms. And    1.5127085093302464
millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition,    1.5636360329510388
designed for today's hunting and target shooting.   And due    1.5127085093302464
to modern resource-use and game management practices, there is still    1.5636360329510388
game to shoot, even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and    1.6065767145351917
water. Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not as an expendable    1.5636360329510388
natural resource, but as an annual harvest to be sown and also    1.6432600607208703
reaped. Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states,    1.67495327387791
on shooting preserves (one of the newer phases of modern game-management)    1.6065767145351917
for five and six months each year.   Close to two million    1.6065767145351917
game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting    1.5636360329510388
preserves, and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas    1.5127085093302464
during the 1960-61 season. The shooting development program of the    1.5636360329510388
Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully    1.4513752902486308
published these facts in all major outdoor magazines, many national    1.5636360329510388
weeklies and the trade papers.   The most effective way to    1.5636360329510388
develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly    1.6432600607208703
managed shooting preserves. This has been the aim of the director    1.6065767145351917
of the shooting development program, the New York staff of the Sportsmen's    1.6432600607208703
Service Bureau, and the ~SAAMI shooting preserve    1.3761581156320553
field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.   Following    1.6065767145351917
the kick-off of ~SAAMI's shooting development program    1.3761581156320553
in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place in Washington, D& C&.    1.6432600607208703
The group known as the American Association for Health, Physical    1.5636360329510388
Education, and Recreation (a division of the National Education    1.5127085093302464
Association) initiated a conference which brought together representatives    1.4513752902486308
of the National Rifle Association, ~SAAMI and the American    1.5127085093302464
Fishing Tackle Manufacturers. This meeting was called to    1.4513752902486308
determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as    1.6432600607208703
the Outdoor Education Project.   The Outdoor Education Project    1.4513752902486308
took cognizance of the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic    1.5636360329510388
activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship    1.6065767145351917
to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life. The    1.6432600607208703
various team sports assuredly have their place in every school, and    1.6065767145351917
they are important to proper physical development. But with the exception    1.6065767145351917
of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical education    1.5127085093302464
activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of    1.6432600607208703
the average American man or woman.   Following a vigorous campaign    1.5636360329510388
of interpretation and leadership development by ~OEP director    1.4513752902486308
Dr& Julian Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges    1.5127085093302464
and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical    1.5636360329510388
education and recreation programs. ~SAAMI's financial support    1.3761581156320553
since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education.    1.6432600607208703
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have    1.4513752902486308
proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops, at which    1.6065767145351917
hundreds of school administrators, teachers, professors, and recreational    1.4513752902486308
leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education. Considering    1.4513752902486308
that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths, the project    1.6065767145351917
and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more    1.6065767145351917
to reach.   In 1959 ~SAAMI's shooting development program    1.4513752902486308
announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys    1.6065767145351917
and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in    1.6065767145351917
the shooting sports. This program is now nationally known as "Teen    1.6065767145351917
Hunter Clubs".   Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored    1.4513752902486308
by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation.    1.4513752902486308
The first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss, Hempstead, New    1.5636360329510388
York, under the direction of Special Events director Jennings    1.5127085093302464
Dennis. Other pilot programs were conducted by ~A + ~S, Babylon,    1.5636360329510388
New York; J& L& Hudson, Detroit; Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.   1.5127085093302464
Other ~THC activities followed, conducted by shopping    1.3761581156320553
centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers, radio-~TV    1.3761581156320553
stations, newspapers, and other organizations interested in the    1.4513752902486308
need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting    1.6065767145351917
firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations    1.5127085093302464
related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources. ~SAAMI's    1.6065767145351917
field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in    1.5636360329510388
75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic    1.6065767145351917
young Americans.   Through the efforts of ~SAAMI's    1.3761581156320553
shooting development program these shooting activities, and many    1.4513752902486308
others, including assists in the development of public and privately    1.5636360329510388
financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues, rifle and pistol marksmanship    1.6065767145351917
programs have been promoted, to mention only a few.   The    1.5636360329510388
continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will    1.5127085093302464
assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made    1.6432600607208703
aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities    1.5636360329510388
for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand. While individual    1.6065767145351917
sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of our political,    1.6065767145351917
social, educational and even religious leaders too often forget it. Help    1.6065767145351917
is needed from dealers, at the grass-roots level.   The American    1.5636360329510388
gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program    1.5127085093302464
through their industry trade association. Since ~SAAMI's    1.3761581156320553
conception in 1926, and more specifically since the adoption of the    1.6065767145351917
Shooting Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and promotional    1.5636360329510388
man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot    1.6065767145351917
for more youths and adults. We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition    1.7026049541338664
dealer, have benefited through additional sales of equipment.   1.4513752902486308
Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports? Are you looking    1.6432600607208703
ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and    1.6065767145351917
girls, who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life-    1.67495327387791
ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent    1.6065767145351917
ammunition?   <Is your    1.0
sporting firearms and ammunition department    1.1606783668269585

organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting programs, and have information    1.5127085093302464
on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags    1.6065767145351917
on shooting preserves? Ask Sammy Shooter.    1.2818970554302986
WE WERE CAMPING a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in    1.6432600607208703
that land of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's    1.5636360329510388
famed Outer Banks. This beach campground with no trees or hills presents    1.6432600607208703
a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual    1.6065767145351917
use.   With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety    1.67495327387791
of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now. There were    1.6065767145351917
umbrella tents, wall tents, cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup    1.5636360329510388
tents, Pop tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper trailers,    1.6065767145351917
travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes serving as    1.5636360329510388
sunshades over entire family camps.   Moving around camp we saw    1.5636360329510388
all kinds of camp stoves, lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle,    1.6065767145351917
windbreaks and sunshades. We saw similar displays in the other    1.5636360329510388
three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long National Seashore Recreation    1.5127085093302464
Area. Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often, look    1.6432600607208703
at the equipment and talk with the campers. Here you begin to appreciate    1.67495327387791
the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.   1.5636360329510388
Camping is big and getting bigger. No one knows where it will    1.6432600607208703
stop. Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement    1.6065767145351917
of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of    1.6432600607208703
all outdoor markets. You read various guesses on how many Americans    1.6065767145351917
are camping. The number depends on who is talking at the moment. The    1.67495327387791
figures range as high as 15 million families. I've heard 10 million    1.6432600607208703
mentioned often, but I'm more inclined to think there may be a    1.6432600607208703
total of some five to seven million families camping. Seven million families    1.6432600607208703
would total 30 million Americans or more. Consider the equipment    1.5636360329510388
needed to protect this many from the weather, to make their cooking    1.6432600607208703
easy and their sleeping comfortable.    1.1606783668269585
Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they    1.5636360329510388
know what to do with. They are struggling to meet the demand for camping    1.7026049541338664
space, but families are being turned away, especially on holiday    1.5636360329510388
weekends. The National Parks, always popular camping places, are facing    1.5636360329510388
the same pressure. The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to    1.6065767145351917
have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day- almost    1.5636360329510388
twice what there are at present. The U& S& Forest Service cares    1.6432600607208703
for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests    1.6065767145351917
and is increasing its facilities steadily.   But the campers still    1.5636360329510388
come. They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding.    1.6432600607208703
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.    1.5636360329510388
They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing    1.5636360329510388
numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation    1.67495327387791
that becomes a family experience of lasting importance.    1.4513752902486308
There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for    1.5636360329510388
the migration to the campgrounds. Among them, according to the U&    1.6065767145351917
S& Department of Commerce, are: (1) shorter work weeks, (2)    1.5636360329510388
higher pay, (3) longer paid vacations, (4) better transportation, (5)    1.5636360329510388
earlier retirement, and (6) more education. The more people learn about    1.6065767145351917
their country, the more they want to learn. Camping is family fun,    1.6432600607208703
and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever    1.7026049541338664
saw before.   But make no mistake about it, the first reason    1.6065767145351917
people turn to camping is one of economy. Here is the promise of a vacation    1.7269387314284994
trip they can afford.   The American Automobile Association,    1.4513752902486308
computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes    1.6065767145351917
up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29. The ~AAA    1.6065767145351917
then splits it down this way: $10.50 for meals, $9.50 for lodging,    1.6432600607208703
$7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.   What does    1.67495327387791
the camping couple do to this set of figures? The $9.50 for lodging    1.67495327387791
they save. Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in    1.6432600607208703
their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most    1.67495327387791
of the tip money. The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing    1.6432600607208703
cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping    1.6065767145351917
along the way.   Where Americans used to think of a single    1.6065767145351917
vacation each summer, they now think about how many vacations they    1.6065767145351917
can have. Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or    1.7026049541338664
four days several times a year. And even if they stay in resorts part    1.7026049541338664
of the time, they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow, develop    1.7026049541338664
a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip    1.6432600607208703
into the wide open spaces.   It would be a mistake to sell those    1.67495327387791
thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts    1.6065767145351917
of home. They're not. Home is the place to find the comforts of    1.67495327387791
home. They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences. But    1.5636360329510388
it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable    1.67495327387791
camping has become. This is no longer a way of life for the bearded    1.7026049541338664
logger and the wandering cowboy. Today's campers want comforts, and    1.5636360329510388
they have them. And this helps explain why so many people are now going    1.7026049541338664
camping. It's fun, and it's easy- so easy that there is time    1.6432600607208703
left after cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out and    1.67495327387791
enjoy outdoor fun with their families.   Camp meals are no great    1.6065767145351917
problem. Neither are beds, thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags.    1.6065767145351917
Neither are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs of every    1.67495327387791
camper or prospective camper.   But there is still the sometimes    1.5636360329510388
complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for    1.5636360329510388
their individual needs.    1.0
@ Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance has become    1.5636360329510388
the commander of others- for good or bad. Since the Industrial    1.6065767145351917
Revolution, when factories emerged, this classical pattern has been    1.5127085093302464
followed. {Until recently.}   There have always been tales    1.4513752902486308
of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator,    1.5127085093302464
willingly or not, and found he didn't like it; the scientist    1.6065767145351917
who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more    1.6065767145351917
commonly in recent years, the engineer who found that other duties interfered    1.6432600607208703
with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions. {There    1.3761581156320553
have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into    1.6065767145351917
very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work, to their own and    1.6432600607208703
the public's dissatisfaction and loss.}   This has been more    1.5127085093302464
evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased    1.4513752902486308
technology. The remedies have been many and varied- attempts to    1.5636360329510388
teach management techniques- either in plant, at special schools,    1.5127085093302464
or    1.0
in university "crash" courses- provision of management-trained assistants    1.4513752902486308
or associates. {But the realization has been growing that    1.5127085093302464
these are not the complete answer.} Some men have no talent for or    1.67495327387791
interest in management; forcing them into management can only create    1.5636360329510388
trouble. The old shop adage still holds: "A good mechanic is usually    1.6432600607208703
a bad boss".   Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition    1.5636360329510388
of managerial status as the gage of success. Labor fights to    1.6065767145351917
change its collar from blue to white. All grades of management seek    1.6432600607208703
more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures. As several    1.6065767145351917
recent books have over-emphasized, {we have become the most status-conscious    1.5636360329510388
nation in the world.}   {What can be done for    1.5127085093302464
the "individual contributor"} who is extremely important- and    1.4513752902486308
likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented    1.6432600607208703
company? He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and    1.6432600607208703
outside; usually concerned about America's belief that attainment    1.4513752902486308
and success are measured in dollars and titles. Yet titles are traditionally    1.6432600607208703
given only to management men, and income tends to rise with    1.6065767145351917
title.   Even the college professor in America has been affected.    1.5636360329510388
It is, as one engineer says, "indeed a difficult thing for the    1.6432600607208703
engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he    1.7269387314284994
could employing managerial skills. This difficulty arises even though    1.5127085093302464
we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course. This    1.67495327387791
leads one to conclude, as you have, that there is inevitably more    1.6432600607208703
prestige in a management position in the minds of our people".   1.6065767145351917
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than    1.67495327387791
engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers. So we asked such    1.5127085093302464
men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on    1.67495327387791
the "dual-road-up" problem- and more importantly- their solutions.    1.4513752902486308
In the paragraphs that follow, we quote from 32 men who are identified    1.67495327387791
on the final page.    1.0
Among    1.0
the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of    1.5636360329510388
General Electric. {This is not a mutually exclusive plan; there    1.5636360329510388
is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the    1.7269387314284994
technical or the managerial path upward. Further, the management path    1.5636360329510388
does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by    1.6432600607208703
the more technical path. It is common to shift back and forth, working    1.67495327387791
up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.}   1.5127085093302464
Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor    1.3761581156320553
positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide "services"    1.5636360329510388
operation that are filled by men with successful managerial    1.5127085093302464
experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.   Also,    1.4513752902486308
moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's    1.6065767145351917
recognition as a technical expert. As examples at ~GE: Glen    1.5636360329510388
B& Warren, formerly manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized    1.5636360329510388
as a turbine designer. The late W& R& G& Baker, a pioneer    1.6432600607208703
in television design and long-time ~vp + ~gm of the Electronics    1.5636360329510388
Division, and later, by his own choice, an individual consultant.    1.5636360329510388
Harold E& Strang, expert in switchgear design, for a long period    1.6065767145351917
~vp + ~gm of the Measurements + Industrial Products Division,    1.4513752902486308
and who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president and consulting    1.5127085093302464
engineer in the Switchgear + Control Division.   In    1.3761581156320553
the ~GE plan, a number of individual contributors have positions    1.5636360329510388
and compensation higher than those of many managers. These positions    1.5636360329510388
carry such titles as:   Consultant- Advanced Development   1.3761581156320553
Consulting Engineer   Consulting Engineer- Heat Transfer   1.2818970554302986
Consulting Electrical Engineer   Senior Electrical    1.1606783668269585
Engineer   Senior Physicist   Westinghouse has a similar    1.3761581156320553
system, with two classifications representing various levels of competence    1.5127085093302464
on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist,    1.5127085093302464
as the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist. Many    1.6065767145351917
companies have systems, particularly in ~R + ~D, which work more    1.5636360329510388
or less well, depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on    1.67495327387791
the part of administration, as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent    1.6065767145351917
quotations.   Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel    1.5636360329510388
recognition is, as one man says it: "**h that the fad for educating    1.67495327387791
top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically    1.5636360329510388
trained approach". _SENIOR STAFF ENGINEER?_ One company instituted,    1.4513752902486308
early in 1959, a vertical classification system consisting of four    1.5636360329510388
levels. There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;    1.5636360329510388
the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer, enjoys status    1.5127085093302464
and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision.    1.67495327387791
The second level, senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level    1.5127085093302464
supervision. The expectation is that first-level supervisors will    1.4513752902486308
be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third    1.6065767145351917
engineering level, with very few coming from the first level.   1.5636360329510388
The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for    1.6065767145351917
non-supervisory engineers, but probably not into executive levels.    1.4513752902486308
{In this organization, about half of the engineers with 15 or more    1.6432600607208703
years of employment are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere.} This    1.5636360329510388
reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which    1.5636360329510388
are not military. Several other examples: _CENTRAL AND SATELLITE_    1.5127085093302464
"We have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering    1.6065767145351917
department headed by a chief engineer. We have set up a central ~R    1.67495327387791
+ ~D department, as well as engineering-management departments-    1.3761581156320553
about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants.    1.6432600607208703
A separate research department is, of course, confined to new or future    1.6432600607208703
designs. Part of this headquarters staff, however, are engineering    1.5127085093302464
managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters    1.5127085093302464
management. These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president-    1.4513752902486308
Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers and chief    1.4513752902486308
engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are    1.67495327387791
engineers who have been advanced from the divisions. These men are    1.6065767145351917
considered managers of engineers. They must learn to wear several hats,    1.6065767145351917
so to speak, working with management, sales and engineering problems    1.5636360329510388
related to the product.   "We do not have people in our organization    1.6432600607208703
termed 'consultants' or 'fellows', who are specialists    1.3761581156320553
in one particular technical subject. I suppose it is because we are    1.6432600607208703
just not big enough. We have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers    1.6065767145351917
retained and called in on certain problems. The only 'fellows'    1.5636360329510388
in our company are those who have been honored by ~ASME, ~AIEE    1.6432600607208703
or ~AIChE **h I am sure that the engineer who enters    1.6065767145351917
management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities    1.5636360329510388
than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider    1.6432600607208703
accountability".    1.0
_ANOTHER STRUCTURE_ "We have tried to make both    1.4513752902486308
paths attractive, so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction    1.6065767145351917
in either. One way to formalize this is in the job structure.    1.6432600607208703
We have these positions, which compare directly: **f   "Above    1.5127085093302464
these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president    1.6065767145351917
of ~Engrg, ~R + ~D. The latter jobs include major management    1.5636360329510388
responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily    1.6432600607208703
through the engineering-management side **h {We have not yet    1.5127085093302464
succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable    1.4513752902486308
to our higher levels of management, but I believe we will trend    1.6432600607208703
in this direction} **h but not to exceed vice-president". _TOP    1.5636360329510388
JOB: RESEARCH SCIENTIST_ "Approximately four years ago, we    1.4513752902486308
initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons **h The    1.6065767145351917
highest position is known as a 'research scientist'. This approach    1.5636360329510388
has not been entirely satisfactory. The primary deterrent appears to    1.5636360329510388
lie with the technical people themselves, and their concept of what    1.6065767145351917
constitutes status in present-day society. {Scientists who agitate    1.4513752902486308
hardest    1.0
for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept    1.5636360329510388
it **h We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private    1.6432600607208703
offices and private secretaries are extremely important;} and although    1.5127085093302464
we have attempted to provide these status symbols, support of the    1.6065767145351917
'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted **h despite the creation    1.5127085093302464
of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that    1.6065767145351917
of men in top managerial positions.   {"A serious problem    1.5127085093302464
accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly    1.5127085093302464
defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.}    1.5127085093302464
With no set standards, there is the tendency to promote to the    1.6432600607208703
next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless    1.67495327387791
of performance **h {promotion is too often based on longevity and    1.6065767145351917
time in salary grade instead of merit.} If no specific organization    1.6065767145351917
plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level,    1.6065767145351917
the result is a department top-heavy with high-level, high-salaried personnel".    1.5636360329510388
_STAFF ENGINEER @ DEPT MANAGER_ "We have two approaches    1.4513752902486308
for the technical man: the position of staff engineer, which    1.5636360329510388
is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative    1.6432600607208703
organization to take the routine load away from department managers    1.5636360329510388
and project engineers as much as possible, thus allowing them more time    1.6432600607208703
for strictly technical work. These are only halfway measures, and    1.5636360329510388
the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man    1.7026049541338664
in industry **h to progress without limit in salary and prestige".    1.6065767145351917
_A COMPLETE PLAN_ "We have made limited application of the 'parallel    1.6065767145351917
ladder' plan. The highest rated non-supervisory engineering    1.3761581156320553
title is 'research engineer'. The salary schedule permits remuneration    1.5127085093302464
greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering    1.6065767145351917
supervision (engineering section head). We also have an 'engineering    1.5127085093302464
section head- research engineer' classification which has salary    1.4513752902486308
possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer. Above this    1.5636360329510388
point there is no generally used parallel ladder.   "We also    1.5636360329510388
do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a    1.7269387314284994
'professional'    1.0
and also to give public recognition to individual technical    1.5127085093302464
competence. {These include encouragement of, and assistance    1.3761581156320553
to, the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers.    1.5636360329510388
We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity, a magazine    1.6065767145351917
widely distributed both within and without the company, and an    1.5636360329510388
information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes    1.5127085093302464
of all engineers.} Publicity is given to the award of patents to    1.6432600607208703
our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership    1.5636360329510388
in technical societies.   "A recent, and more pertinent action,    1.5127085093302464
has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the    1.6065767145351917
vice-president for Engineering. This function is staffed by engineers    1.5127085093302464
chosen for their technical competence and who have the title, member    1.6065767145351917
of the technical staff'. Salaries compare favorably with those paid    1.5636360329510388
to the first two or three levels of management. Additional symbols    1.6065767145351917
of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive badge passes    1.6065767145351917
authorizing special privileges, and a difference in the treatment    1.5127085093302464
of financial progress through merit.   "We presently are involved    1.5127085093302464
in inaugurating a new development center. Operations of this nature    1.5636360329510388
offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status. All scientific    1.5636360329510388
staff members will have the title, 'research-staff member'.    1.4513752902486308
The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the    1.6432600607208703
scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific    1.6065767145351917
field. Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations,    1.2818970554302986
the position to which research-staff members report administratively will    1.5127085093302464
not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member,    1.5127085093302464
therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as highly.   "These    1.4513752902486308
recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number    1.67495327387791
of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence. It    1.5127085093302464
is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result    1.6432600607208703
entirely from company efforts. Fundamental to the difficulty of creating    1.5636360329510388
the desired prestige is the fact that, in the business community,    1.6065767145351917
prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that    1.6065767145351917
one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in    1.67495327387791
the management functions".   1.0
SIXTY MILES NORTH of New York City where the wooded hills    1.6065767145351917
of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there    1.6432600607208703
is a new home development called "Oakwood Heights". As a matter    1.6065767145351917
of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated    1.67495327387791
county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages    1.5127085093302464
in the $14,000 range. But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular    1.6432600607208703
**h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line    1.7026049541338664
that starts at a central storage point.   This is a pilot operation    1.6432600607208703
sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State    1.6065767145351917
Pipeline Corporation, with principal offices in New York State.    1.5127085093302464
Its president is Otis M& Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen    1.67495327387791
+ Waters, 5404 Chrysler Bldg&, New York City. Vice-president    1.4513752902486308
is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter.    1.5127085093302464
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft    1.6065767145351917
Distributors, Inc&, Newburgh, N&Y&.   The idea    1.2818970554302986
of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty.    1.7269387314284994
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U& S&    1.7026049541338664
and Canada, even overseas, write to FUELOIL + OIL HEAT to inquire    1.6065767145351917
if it's feasible and where it is being done. Its editors only    1.6432600607208703
knew of one example to point to, a public housing development of 278    1.67495327387791
homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue.    1.67495327387791
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern    1.6065767145351917
among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered. Rather    1.67495327387791
the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis    1.6065767145351917
of number of rooms and persons in the family.   Common complaints    1.6065767145351917
included "Mrs& Murphy" leaving her windows open all the time,    1.5636360329510388
a fresh air fan, or the family was visiting "Aunt Minnie" with    1.6432600607208703
the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil. As a    1.7269387314284994
result of that attitude, others have been discouraged from trying central    1.6065767145351917
distribution.   A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks    1.6065767145351917
the situation at Oakwood Heights. Called a "Slo-Flo" meter    1.5127085093302464
it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles,    1.67495327387791
a key individual being Don Nelson. Tri-State has acquired    1.5127085093302464
its exclusive distribution for the northern, principal heating states.   1.5127085093302464
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed    1.5636360329510388
by a lawyer. The earlier New Haven development was public housing,    1.6065767145351917
so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture. These    1.67495327387791
have to do with property rights, municipal official attitudes and    1.5636360329510388
a host of others. In working out the practical legal conclusions President    1.6432600607208703
Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project, for it is    1.6432600607208703
planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments    1.6065767145351917
nationally.   It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming,    1.5127085093302464
to get approval of any kind of line under a public street, as one    1.7026049541338664
example. To overcome this, the builder lays and completes the street    1.6065767145351917
himself, then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual    1.6065767145351917
easement for the oil lines. When a family buys a home the title is subject    1.7269387314284994
to a perpetual easement to Tri-State. For the central storage,    1.5636360329510388
Tri-State buys one acre, Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent    1.6065767145351917
title to that piece. In other words, the whole storage and pipeline    1.6432600607208703
system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather    1.67495327387791
to Tri-State.   How does Tri-State get its revenue from this    1.5636360329510388
plan? It leases the whole facility to a large oil company, at least    1.67495327387791
large enough to have a strong credit position. This first test is    1.6432600607208703
being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least    1.6432600607208703
15 years. The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use    1.7026049541338664
of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all    1.6065767145351917
the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable    1.6065767145351917
to both parties.   On this first venture the central storage is    1.6065767145351917
20,000 gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons for each of    1.7026049541338664
the 50 homes. The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport    1.6065767145351917
loads, so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather    1.6065767145351917
contingencies. However, that is not all he has to do. He must    1.6432600607208703
undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine    1.5636360329510388
heating. In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water    1.6432600607208703
form Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot    1.4513752902486308
water hookups. Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals    1.67495327387791
as he finds best.   For this first development the supplier    1.5636360329510388
signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being    1.7269387314284994
transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor. The major    1.5636360329510388
gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor    1.67495327387791
apparently can do well because delivery cost is low.    1.5127085093302464
The officers of the new corporation have naturally    1.4513752902486308
explored many angles, as well as personalities that might be affected.    1.6065767145351917
For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie town (township) where the    1.5636360329510388
project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow    1.6432600607208703
clearing problem. The central storage is near a main artery quite    1.6065767145351917
easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing, with fewer    1.67495327387791
trucks in the residential streets.   The Public Service Commission    1.5127085093302464
has ruled that this is not a public utility, subject to    1.6065767145351917
their    1.0
many regulations.   Several financial institutions, both banks    1.3761581156320553
and insurance companies, have been sounded out. They like it and would    1.6432600607208703
supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong    1.67495327387791
oil companies.   The Government housing agencies consider it    1.4513752902486308
feasible with one special stipulation. There must be a restriction in    1.6065767145351917
the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the    1.7026049541338664
current market price for the oil **h an obvious precaution, since the    1.6432600607208703
account is permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.   1.5636360329510388
For a few details of the system **h the lines are 1-1/4''    1.6432600607208703
<X-Tru-Coat,> a product of Republic Steel Corp&, and all lines    1.5636360329510388
are welded. They are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some    1.67495327387791
areas four feet down, particularly under roads, to stay clear of all    1.6432600607208703
other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy    1.67495327387791
trucking. The meter is mounted high on the basement wall. Its figures    1.6432600607208703
are a half inch high and very easy to read, even into tenth gallons.    1.7026049541338664
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.   1.67495327387791
Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total cost of all the    1.6432600607208703
heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than    1.6065767145351917
would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.    1.67495327387791
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder    1.67495327387791
developments where gas is available.   It would be pretty    1.5127085093302464
difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods, and that's    1.6065767145351917
an understatement. The job of getting property easements and street    1.5636360329510388
easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.    1.6065767145351917
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch    1.5636360329510388
the solutions are simple.    1.0
What does Tri-State actually    1.0
want to do, now that it has the meters under franchise and certain    1.67495327387791
phases of its piping system in the "patent applied for" stage?    1.6065767145351917
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including    1.67495327387791
its facility in their new home projects, by financing and installing    1.6065767145351917
the storage, piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years,    1.6065767145351917
with renewal options, to a strong oil company. It may also work in one    1.7026049541338664
other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters,    1.6065767145351917
letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.   1.6065767145351917
This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers,    1.6432600607208703
for the idea has so often been mentioned, somewhat wistfully.    1.5636360329510388
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights. Only eight of    1.67495327387791
the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on    1.67495327387791
June 8th; others were building. The big tanks were at the site but    1.67495327387791
still sunning themselves. A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches,    1.6065767145351917
and the town building inspector was paying a friendly, if curious,    1.6065767145351917
visit.   The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a revival    1.6065767145351917
of research and development. A primary ingredient in these fields    1.5636360329510388
is imagination, and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a    1.4513752902486308
very good mark.   1.0
EVERY YEAR about this time National Gargle Your Cooling    1.5127085093302464
System week rolls around. It pays in the long (hot) run to take good    1.7026049541338664
care of the water works. Do it this way for the summer gargle:   1.67495327387791
@ First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer. Don't    1.5636360329510388
save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive "permanent" type.    1.5636360329510388
The word means it won't boil away easily, nothing else. The rust    1.6432600607208703
inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year, and you don't want    1.7026049541338664
to risk the rust that two years' use could mean. Pitch it out.   1.67495327387791
@ If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good flushing cleaner.   1.7026049541338664
@ Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor. Of    1.5636360329510388
course, you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.   1.67495327387791
@ Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections,    1.5636360329510388
around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals and heater    1.5636360329510388
fittings.   @ Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat    1.67495327387791
opens, and then look for leaks again. Be sure the bugs and    1.6432600607208703
dirt are blown out of the radiator fins. Use the air hose for this job.    1.7269387314284994
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.   If you    1.6432600607208703
use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as "Dowguard"    1.6432600607208703
be sure to check it. Dow says that the fluid can be used now    1.7026049541338664
for two years. Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in    1.6065767145351917
during the summer.   Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid    1.6065767145351917
those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms    1.5636360329510388
this summer.   {Don't let your mechanics} pull the thermostats    1.5127085093302464
out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours.    1.6065767145351917
Spring and summer may be here officially, but those thermos stay    1.6065767145351917
in.   The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from    1.6432600607208703
any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase the fuel consumption,    1.5636360329510388
reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation    1.6432600607208703
of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.   If you    1.5127085093302464
run into excess plug fouling on one truck, check to be sure that the rig    1.7269387314284994
has a thermostat. The thermostat is important to get your engine up    1.6432600607208703
to operating temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its most    1.6432600607208703
efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.   1.5127085093302464
{Are you paying too much} for your truck insurance? There's    1.5636360329510388
a good chance you are doubling on some coverage, not taking discounts    1.6432600607208703
coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.   1.6432600607208703
Have a talk with your insurance agent. Be careful that you keep    1.6432600607208703
adequate coverage, but look for places to save money. First go over the    1.67495327387791
type of coverage you now have. Look for these features which may mean    1.67495327387791
you can save:   @ Duplicate coverage. Avoid doubling up    1.4513752902486308
on the same item. For example, don't pay in a truck policy for medical    1.7026049541338664
coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.   1.67495327387791
@ Does your policy have a lay-up clause? This means that    1.5636360329510388
if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days, insurance    1.67495327387791
can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to    1.6432600607208703
you. This applies to repair work or winter storage.   The figure    1.6065767145351917
five is important in insurance. With many company policies you get    1.6065767145351917
a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs. This means either cars    1.7026049541338664
or trucks. Discounts run up to 2% of cost.   Usually premium    1.6065767145351917
reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability    1.5636360329510388
plan. For example: If your bodily injury claims start payment after    1.6065767145351917
the first $250, a 25% premium saving is often made.    1.5636360329510388
{I}n the period since the end of World War /2,- a period    1.6432600607208703
coinciding    1.0
with merchandising demands for the colorful, the unusual, and the original    1.6065767145351917
in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that    1.6065767145351917
today    1.0
they are the acknowledged leaders in the field. The importance of the    1.6432600607208703
sign industry to the plastics industry, however, is not in terms of    1.6432600607208703
volume alone. Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing    1.6065767145351917
approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings    1.6065767145351917
of other industries. Many of today's developments in thermoforming    1.5127085093302464
stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of    1.6432600607208703
preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers;    1.5636360329510388
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons,    1.5127085093302464
medallions, etc&, owes much to the field, as does the technology    1.6065767145351917
of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent    1.5127085093302464
plastics.   There is much that many industries can continue to    1.5636360329510388
learn from some of the more recent developments described below. The    1.6065767145351917
concept of trans-illumination (as shown by the photo on p& 92), as just    1.67495327387791
one example, offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-    1.5636360329510388
no matter what industry is involved.    1.2818970554302986
According    1.0
to a recent <Wall Street Journal> survey, plastics units now    1.5636360329510388
account for more than 50% of all sign sales. Five years ago, they had    1.7026049541338664
only 10% of the market, with the remainder firmly entrenched in the    1.6432600607208703
stronghold of neon tubing. And it's far from the end for plastics.    1.6432600607208703
Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during    1.6432600607208703
the 1960's will be of plastic construction. Evidence of this    1.5636360329510388
trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies    1.67495327387791
in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.    1.6065767145351917
Four years ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon    1.6065767145351917
signs; today, 85% is in plastics.   From the volume standpoint,    1.5636360329510388
the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive. Aggregate    1.6065767145351917
sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million. Currently,    1.4513752902486308
there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging from small firms    1.6432600607208703
with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities    1.6065767145351917
for production of metal, electrical, and plastic components.    1.4513752902486308
What accounts for the rapid growth    1.2818970554302986
of plastics in the sign and display field? Out of many factors which    1.67495327387791
might be cited, five are most important: _1._ Plastics combine    1.5636360329510388
such properties as built-in color, light weight, optional transparency    1.5127085093302464
or translucency, resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication.    1.6432600607208703
_2._ Plastic signs are economical. According to one    1.4513752902486308
major producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately    1.5636360329510388
25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit. Shipping cost is    1.6432600607208703
also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft& plastic sign weighs about 120 lb&,    1.6065767145351917
compared to 275-300 lb& for neon. The weight advantage, plus greater    1.6065767145351917
durability of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth    1.6065767145351917
in shipping. The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings    1.6432600607208703
are needed. Finally, maintenance costs on plastic signs are    1.5127085093302464
much lower than on fragile neon signs. _3._ They offer exceptional    1.6065767145351917
design freedom, making it    1.0
possible to incorporate contours and details    1.2818970554302986
which give free range to the talents of the designer. Vacuum- and pressure-formed    1.67495327387791
sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded    1.5127085093302464
plastics. Pre-decoration,    1.0
low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large    1.4513752902486308
and small, thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the    1.6065767145351917
industry. _4._ Plastics signs work around the clock. Internal    1.5127085093302464
illumination, protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual    1.5127085093302464
appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command    1.5636360329510388
attention and interest. _5._ Advances in equipment and fabrication    1.5127085093302464
techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide    1.5636360329510388
choice of production techniques, ranging from injection molding for    1.5127085093302464
intricate, smaller-size, mass-production signs (generally 5000 units is    1.4513752902486308
the minimum) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited    1.6432600607208703
runs. Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field    1.6065767145351917
are expandable styrene molding and blow molding. _WHAT PLASTICS    1.5127085093302464
TO USE?_ For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its outstanding    1.6065767145351917
optical characteristics, weather resistance and formability, strongly    1.3761581156320553
dominates the picture. At present, both the familiar cast acrylic    1.5636360329510388
and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers,    1.6065767145351917
with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total. (See    1.6065767145351917
panel, p& 166, for a comparison.)   Of interest is a recent    1.6065767145351917
announcement by Du Pont's    1.0
Polychemicals Dept& of a new methyl methacrylate    1.3761581156320553
monomer designated as Monocite ~H 100, which was developed    1.5127085093302464
specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and    1.6065767145351917
lighting industry. Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs    1.5127085093302464
only one-third as much as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather,    1.67495327387791
and will not yellow. Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures,    1.6432600607208703
resists chipping, cracking, and crazing, according to Du Pont.   1.5127085093302464
Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed    1.4513752902486308
signs, background panels, and molded or formed letters because of its    1.6065767145351917
exceptional toughness, ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties.    1.5127085093302464
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important    1.5127085093302464
factors. New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which    1.67495327387791
the two sheets of the laminate are of different color. Thermoforming    1.6065767145351917
the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical    1.7026049541338664
way to produce a two-color sign. (see ~MPl, Mar& 1961,    1.5636360329510388
p&    1.0
98).   For specialized types of displays, such as large three-dimensional    1.5636360329510388
units reproducing a product, package, human or animal figures,    1.5127085093302464
etc&, reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols    1.4513752902486308
are other materials frequently used.   A relative newcomer    1.4513752902486308
in    1.0
outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film, now used as a printed overlay    1.6432600607208703
for trans-illuminated signs (see below).   For outdoor signs and    1.5127085093302464
displays, where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a    1.6065767145351917
factor, the choice of plastics is almost unlimited. Here may be found    1.6432600607208703
regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate and    1.5127085093302464
cellulose propionate, acrylic, vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene.    1.5127085093302464
The final choice of material depends upon such factors as    1.5636360329510388
costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity, number of units    1.5636360329510388
required, time available for tooling, and projected life expectancy of    1.5636360329510388
the unit. Often, the finished sign or display incorporates several types    1.6065767145351917
of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques.    1.4513752902486308
One of the most significant advancements in design    1.4513752902486308
of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard, now    1.5127085093302464
being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance    1.5636360329510388
Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, and Industrial Electric Inc&,    1.5127085093302464
New Orleans, La&.   The essential difference between the new    1.5127085093302464
trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former,    1.5127085093302464
constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted from within.    1.5127085093302464
With the source of light behind the copy, there is no loss of lumen output,    1.7269387314284994
as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light.    1.5636360329510388
Also, the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure    1.6065767145351917
and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.   The copy itself,    1.6065767145351917
including any text or illustrations, is reproduced in full color directly    1.6065767145351917
on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process. The    1.6432600607208703
film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto    1.7026049541338664
the acrylic panels forming the sign, and also to be stripped off for    1.67495327387791
replacement by new copy as required. Spare sets of face panels simplify    1.6432600607208703
the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged    1.67495327387791
for the old right in the field on a single trip. Panels with    1.67495327387791
outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.   1.7269387314284994
Signs of this type have already made their appearance    1.5127085093302464
in several larger cities, and others are on the way. It is believed that    1.7026049541338664
these boards will, within the next few years, replace many of the    1.6432600607208703
conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.   Trans-illuminated    1.3761581156320553
signs also show versatility in other directions. As used by Industrial    1.6065767145351917
Electric Inc&, the film panels are printed one at a time, as    1.6432600607208703
are 24-sheet posters. Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent    1.6432600607208703
plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels    1.5636360329510388
for use on cutouts, or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin    1.67495327387791
faces. In this way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying    1.67495327387791
uniform copy on different sign media.   Recently Industrial    1.4513752902486308
Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern    1.5127085093302464
plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign. Comprised of 16    1.5127085093302464
triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible to    1.5127085093302464
combine three different signs in a single unit. The triangles automatically    1.6065767145351917
revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec& of viewing time for    1.6432600607208703
each poster subject. Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft&    1.6065767145351917
wide, make up the 25-ft& length of the sign.    1.5127085093302464
Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility    1.4513752902486308
of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays    1.6432600607208703
would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this    1.748515906000203
complex field- changeable signs.   Signs are meant to convey    1.5127085093302464
a message, and in most cases, this requires words and letters. Frequently,    1.6432600607208703
the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products,    1.6065767145351917
price changes, etc&. The huge market for changeable signs has spurred    1.6065767145351917
a universal demand for individual plastic letters, in all shapes    1.5636360329510388
and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them. Here    1.7026049541338664
are some of the newer items currently available:   Poster Products    1.5636360329510388
Inc&, Chicago, Ill&: a changeable copy and display    1.4513752902486308
sign    1.0
which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of    1.6065767145351917
colors, onto which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words screened    1.6065767145351917
on acetate or other types of sheet stock. The background, which    1.6065767145351917
is available    1.0
in various widths and continuous lengths, is extruded with    1.5127085093302464
parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.   1.5127085093302464
The Adaptaplex Co&, Beaverton, Ore&; letters molded    1.3761581156320553
of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red or black. Ideal    1.6432600607208703
for merchandising use, they are weather-resistant, and have mounting    1.5127085093302464
pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern    1.6432600607208703
background panel.   For large letters, <e&g&> thermoformed    1.3761581156320553
of acrylic or butyrate, there are other techniques. For example,    1.5636360329510388
in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in& and six 36-in& red    1.6065767145351917
acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background.    1.5636360329510388
The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb& each made    1.67495327387791
it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic    1.6432600607208703
angle brackets cemented to the letters. Stainless steel screws were    1.5636360329510388
used to minimize corrosion stains. For mounting to corrugated plastic    1.5636360329510388
backgrounds, very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters    1.67495327387791
and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings, its ends    1.5636360329510388
twisted behind the panels.   Large injection-molded letters are    1.4513752902486308
also available for sign installations. Wagner Sign Service Inc&,    1.5127085093302464
Chicago, for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights of    1.6065767145351917
4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches. They are molded of a special weather-resistant    1.7026049541338664
formulation of Tenite butyrate. Also available from this company    1.5127085093302464
are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars, extruded of transparent acrylic material,    1.4513752902486308
which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.    1.5636360329510388
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft&, the bars are shaped in cross    1.7026049541338664
section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back    1.67495327387791
of the letters.   Still another approach to the changeable letter    1.5636360329510388
type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products, Azusa,    1.6432600607208703
Calif&. This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in& (or    1.5636360329510388
smaller) panels formed of 0.080-in& clear butyrate sheet stock, masked    1.5636360329510388
and sprayed on the rear side. Finished signs are produced by sliding    1.6432600607208703
the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in& aluminum,    1.5127085093302464
which may be mounted to various surfaces. The sheets are extruded of    1.6432600607208703
Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.   1.5127085093302464
On large-area units, where additional structural requirements    1.3761581156320553
are imposed, one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed    1.5636360329510388
channels (<e&g&> right-angled corrugations) of the acrylic or butyrate.    1.5127085093302464
Joined side by side, such channels make possible construction    1.5127085093302464
of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft& high and    1.6065767145351917
of unlimited width. Letters may be wired to the face of the combined    1.67495327387791
channels, painted on the first surface, or handled in other ways.    1.6065767145351917
FROM    1.0
Don't insert your components into fixed openings,    1.3761581156320553
they may or may not fit; position your components before you close    1.6432600607208703
them in. For example:   Don't wall in your kitchen before    1.5636360329510388
you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances. It's a lot quicker    1.67495327387791
and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect    1.6432600607208703
the end wall after they are all in place.   Set your bathtub before    1.67495327387791
you close in the end of the bathroom. Don't try to wrestle a    1.67495327387791
400-~lb tub **f through a narrow doorway.   Finish your plumbing    1.5636360329510388
before you frame it in (most economical framing is a thin non-bearing    1.6432600607208703
partition on either side of the pipes).   Finish installing and    1.5636360329510388
connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them    1.6432600607208703
in. There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a    1.7026049541338664
furnace in a finished **f closet.   Don't position your studs    1.5636360329510388
before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way    1.5636360329510388
you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the    1.7269387314284994
window. You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows    1.67495327387791
in one, two, three order- first the stud on one side, then the window,    1.7026049541338664
then the stud on the other side.   Install your disappearing    1.5636360329510388
stair (or stairs) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before    1.6432600607208703
you drywall the ceiling.   Don't close in your house until everything    1.6065767145351917
has been carried in. Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall    1.6432600607208703
between the house and garage. That way he can truck his parts right    1.67495327387791
indoors and unload them under the roof.   No auto maker would    1.6065767145351917
dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons    1.67495327387791
in the block. And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore    1.6065767145351917
most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds of dollars    1.5636360329510388
by always building from the inside out.    1.3761581156320553
EVERYTHING    1.0
TO GET ALL THE BIG SAVINGS THE REVOLUTION IN MATERIALS HANDLING    1.6065767145351917
This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less    1.2818970554302986
news of all, because **h _1._ It makes it easy to handle much heavier    1.7026049541338664
units, so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated    1.67495327387791
components like those shown in the pictures alongside. _2._    1.5127085093302464
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that (like    1.5636360329510388
earthmoving and roadbuilding) should be lower today than in 1929. _3._    1.6065767145351917
It changes the answers to "Who should do what, and where"?    1.6065767145351917
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases    1.5636360329510388
the chance for shop fabrication, where almost everything can be made    1.6065767145351917
better and cheaper. _4._ It changes the answers on when to do what    1.67495327387791
at the site. For example, instead of putting in your driveways last    1.6432600607208703
(as many builders do) you can now save money by putting them in first.    1.7026049541338664
Instead of closing the house in first (as most builders do) you can    1.67495327387791
now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to (<see    1.7026049541338664
~p    1.0
121>). _5._ It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.    1.5127085093302464
Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs    1.67495327387791
by "buying direct" and short-cutting the dealer. But now many of    1.6065767145351917
these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming    1.67495327387791
up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient    1.67495327387791
specialized equipment    1.0
to deliver everything just where it is needed-    1.4513752902486308
drywall inside the house, siding along the sides, trusses on the walls,    1.6432600607208703
roofing on the roof, etc&.   Says Clarence Thompson: "We    1.5127085093302464
dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder    1.6432600607208703
cheaper than he could do it himself". The revolution now under    1.6065767145351917
way in materials handling makes this much easier. _THE REVOLUTION    1.5636360329510388
IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE_ Five years ago    1.7026049541338664
a HOUSE + HOME Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers'    1.5636360329510388
Research Council reported unhappily:   "Only one lumber    1.3761581156320553
dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car    1.67495327387791
in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer    1.67495327387791
in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder    1.7026049541338664
in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.   "So    1.5636360329510388
from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling    1.6065767145351917
(most of it inefficient) add up to one-fourth of the total construction    1.6432600607208703
cost of housing".   "That HOUSE + HOME Round Table    1.4513752902486308
was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials    1.5636360329510388
handling", says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber Dealers'    1.5636360329510388
Research Council. "It made our whole industry recognize    1.4513752902486308
the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer, carrier, equipment    1.6432600607208703
maker, dealer, and builder, all working together to cut the cost    1.6065767145351917
of materials handling. Before that we lumber dealers were working    1.5636360329510388
almost single-handed on the problem". _HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND    1.5636360329510388
TODAY:_ _1._ Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater    1.6065767145351917
primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new    1.6432600607208703
houses are mechanized. There are few areas left where a builder cannot    1.6432600607208703
find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything    1.6065767145351917
at lower cost just where his workmen will need it. _2._ Practically    1.6432600607208703
all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized    1.6432600607208703
or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber, asphalt    1.4513752902486308
shingles, glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard, gypsum    1.5127085093302464
wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation sheathing, floor tile, acoustical    1.5127085093302464
tile, plaster base, and asbestos shingles. _3._ Truck and    1.5127085093302464
materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to    1.4513752902486308
meet almost every homebuilding need. For some significant new items    1.5636360329510388
see the pictures. _4._ More than 50% of all lumber is unitized;    1.6432600607208703
an ~NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will    1.6065767145351917
strap their shipments for mechanized handling. Of these, 376 said they    1.6065767145351917
make no extra charge for strapping in standard units, because they    1.6065767145351917
save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost.    1.5636360329510388
Most of the others    1.0
will swallow their 50@ to $3 charge rather than lose    1.5636360329510388
a good customer. "With a 15,500-~lb fork-lift, dealers can unload    1.5636360329510388
unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30@/~mbf compared    1.5127085093302464
with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time", says    1.7026049541338664
James Wright of ~NLRDA. _5._ Lumber dealers and lumber    1.5127085093302464
manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments-    1.5636360329510388
48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high (or six McCracken packets    1.6065767145351917
24'' wide by nominal 7'' high). These units make it easy to    1.6432600607208703
load as much as 48,000 ~bd ~ft (say 120,000 ~lb in a 50' box    1.7026049541338664
car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars. _6._ The    1.6065767145351917
railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12'    1.6432600607208703
or wider for forklift unloading (a 21% increase while the total    1.6065767145351917
number of box cars was falling 6%) and by cutting their freight rates    1.67495327387791
twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars. First was a 1958 cut    1.67495327387791
of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000    1.7026049541338664
~lb; later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast (still pending elsewhere)    1.67495327387791
of 7@/~cwt on 70,000 ~lb-plus carloads (which works out to    1.5636360329510388
more than $4/~mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000    1.67495327387791
~lb). _7._ More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars,    1.6065767145351917
and ~NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type    1.6432600607208703
6-~B floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5.4@/~mbf.    1.6065767145351917
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof    1.5636360329510388
paper. This costs from 75@ to $2.30/~mbf, but the cover can    1.6065767145351917
pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open. _THESE CARRIERS    1.7026049541338664
CUT HANDLING COSTS FOR THE DEALER- AND THE BUILDER_ Says ~NRLDA's    1.6065767145351917
James Wright: "Since 1958 carriers that move material    1.4513752902486308
from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes    1.6432600607208703
than any of the dealer's other equipment".   The reason: today's    1.5636360329510388
components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled    1.6065767145351917
by a truckdriver and a helper. So manufacturers have pioneered a new    1.6432600607208703
type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier. It cuts the lumber dealer's    1.6065767145351917
cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload    1.6065767145351917
it, and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction    1.7269387314284994
of the cost of hand unloading. and it helps the builder because it    1.67495327387791
can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can deliver it to the best    1.67495327387791
spot (in some cases, right on the roof or inside the house), and never    1.7026049541338664
takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.   1.6065767145351917
Says Wright: "Our survey shows that one third of the    1.5636360329510388
retail    1.0
dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling    1.5636360329510388
in the coming two years. And most of the gain will be in self-unloading    1.7026049541338664
vehicles".    1.0
Half the manhours    1.0
you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right,    1.7269387314284994
so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right    1.7026049541338664
time, or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots    1.6432600607208703
or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection, or you    1.67495327387791
bought cheap materials that took too long to fit, or your workmen had    1.67495327387791
to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.   1.7269387314284994
Even "America's most efficient builder", Bob Schmitt    1.3761581156320553
of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a    1.7026049541338664
result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation    1.6065767145351917
by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works. Already    1.5127085093302464
this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from    1.6065767145351917
170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.   Builder    1.6065767145351917
Eddie Carr of Washington, past president of ~NAHB, cut his bricklaying    1.6065767145351917
costs $150 a house by adopting the "~SCR masonry process"    1.5636360329510388
worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the Structural    1.5127085093302464
Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better    1.5127085093302464
work for less. A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand    1.6432600607208703
bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process, cut them another    1.67495327387791
$7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot 100-brick    1.6065767145351917
packages. The ~SCR process, with its precision corner-posts,    1.4513752902486308
its precision guide lines, its working level scaffold, and its hand-level    1.6065767145351917
brick supply takes eight manhours to get set, but once ready    1.6065767145351917
it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day. See    1.7026049541338664
<page 156>.   One good way to cut your labor waste is to make    1.67495327387791
sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew. Reports    1.7026049541338664
Jim Lendrum: "By studying men on the job, we found that two men-    1.67495327387791
a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three. We    1.67495327387791
found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall    1.67495327387791
panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men    1.6065767145351917
don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper    1.5127085093302464
team. We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job,    1.67495327387791
five men, not four, is the magic number".   No house was ever    1.6432600607208703
built that could not have been built better for less if the work had    1.7026049541338664
been better planned and the work better scheduled.    1.4513752902486308
5: DON'T WASTE ANY 10@-A-MINUTE TIME ON GREEN LUMBER TO SAVE 3@    1.6432600607208703
This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a builder    1.5127085093302464
can commit.   Green lumber was all very well back in the days    1.6432600607208703
of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then    1.67495327387791
shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum. But now that all production    1.7026049541338664
builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels,    1.6065767145351917
green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.   Green    1.5127085093302464
studs cost about 65@; dry studs cost less than 3@ more. So if    1.67495327387791
a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste    1.7026049541338664
even 20 seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry    1.6432600607208703
stud.   1.0
There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to    1.7269387314284994
be alone. Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves, but away from the    1.7026049541338664
crowds and common happenstance. If you've travelled in Europe a    1.5636360329510388
time or two, it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone    1.6432600607208703
feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic.    1.7026049541338664
Following a guide, and gratefully so, is an excellent way to    1.6065767145351917
see all the important places when everything is strange and new. However,    1.6432600607208703
after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas, the    1.5636360329510388
places and forums, the churches and museums, the palaces and castles,    1.6065767145351917
and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe, you'll want to    1.7026049541338664
change your course and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market    1.67495327387791
places.   The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital    1.4513752902486308
of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has    1.6432600607208703
at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour d'Argent. You    1.7269387314284994
can relive history and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest    1.6432600607208703
for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi, an ancient    1.6432600607208703
town in the heel of Italy's boot. And you don't meet the folks from    1.7026049541338664
home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time    1.6065767145351917
and tourists since the Middle Ages. Time stands still as you climb    1.6432600607208703
the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain    1.6065767145351917
slopes or wander through story-book towns, perched atop lofty crags,    1.5636360329510388
their faces turned to the sea. They've been there since the days    1.6432600607208703
of the Moors and the Saracens. And what better way to end a day    1.7026049541338664
than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's    1.67495327387791
village on the Mediterranean?   An almost too-simple-to-be-true    1.3761581156320553
way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself    1.6432600607208703
behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.   For those    1.7026049541338664
who need or want and can afford another car, buying one and driving    1.67495327387791
it on the grand tour, then shipping it home, is one popular plan for    1.7026049541338664
a do-it-yourself pilgrimage. Then, of course, there are those of us    1.6065767145351917
who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car. The answer    1.7026049541338664
to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one.    1.7026049541338664
It is that elemental.   Almost any travel agent will reserve    1.5636360329510388
a car for you. You can call one of the car rental services directly    1.7026049541338664
(Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others) and ask    1.5127085093302464
them to reserve a car of your choice, and some transportation lines    1.6432600607208703
offer this service as well. With few exceptions, your car will be waiting    1.67495327387791
for you at dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you    1.6065767145351917
arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost. You can wait, of course, until    1.6432600607208703
you arrive in Europe before renting your car. The disadvantages    1.5636360329510388
to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models    1.7269387314284994
readily available or you may have to wait a few days or, during the busy    1.7269387314284994
tourist season, when cars are in great demand, you might find it fairly    1.67495327387791
difficult to get a car at all. Since charges are relatively the    1.6432600607208703
same, reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of    1.67495327387791
having one on tap when you want it.   For those who plan to travel    1.7026049541338664
to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer    1.6432600607208703
a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave    1.748515906000203
it in another city, or even another country, when you are ready to    1.67495327387791
return home. At some cities, this pick-up and delivery service is without    1.6432600607208703
additional charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning    1.6065767145351917
your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free delivery    1.5636360329510388
and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries.   1.6065767145351917
International Touring Documents are usually provided    1.2818970554302986
with the car as are road maps and touring data. A valid American    1.67495327387791
driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal, Spain,    1.5636360329510388
Yugoslavia and Eastern    1.0
Europe. If you plan to visit any of these countries,    1.5636360329510388
you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you    1.5127085093302464
leave at a nominal fee- around $3.00. Your insurance, too, with    1.6065767145351917
most agencies, is provided with the car, covering comprehensive fire,    1.5636360329510388
theft, liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies    1.5636360329510388
in different countries. If you would feel happier with full collision    1.6065767145351917
insurance, there is a small additional charge, again varying from country    1.6065767145351917
to country and depending on the term of such insurance. The average    1.6432600607208703
charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day.    1.6065767145351917
The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as 50@ a day in    1.7026049541338664
Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece.   Rental fees    1.6432600607208703
are variable, too, throughout the countries of Europe. There are as    1.6065767145351917
many rates as there are countries and models of cars available. As in    1.67495327387791
the United States, there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus    1.6065767145351917
a few cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops if the car    1.7026049541338664
is retained for a week. It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one    1.6432600607208703
days.   It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from    1.67495327387791
80@ to 90@ for the equivalent of a United States gallon and    1.6432600607208703
while you might prefer a familiar Ford, Chevrolet or even a Cadillac,    1.6432600607208703
which are available in some countries, it is probably wiser to choose    1.6432600607208703
the smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five and    1.5127085093302464
even forty miles to the gallon.   Your choice of model will undoubtedly    1.6432600607208703
be governed by the number of people travelling in your group.    1.6065767145351917
With the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny sedans will    1.67495327387791
seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage    1.6432600607208703
space for really economical transportation. There is a large variety    1.5636360329510388
of models to choose from in most countries, however, including 6-passenger    1.6065767145351917
sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that    1.6065767145351917
much greater than for the wee sedans.   The basic costs are generally    1.6432600607208703
pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you    1.6065767145351917
reserve your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages.    1.5636360329510388
There is the free intra-city "rent it here, leave it there" service,    1.6432600607208703
as an example, the free delivery and collection at the airport, dockside    1.6432600607208703
or your hotel, luggage racks, touring documents and information    1.5127085093302464
and other similar services. A little investigation by telephone or reading    1.6065767145351917
the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these    1.6432600607208703
pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits. The investigation    1.5127085093302464
will be well worth your time.   All model cars are not    1.6065767145351917
available in all countries. Quite naturally, there is a greater availability    1.6065767145351917
of those models which are manufactured within a specific country.    1.5636360329510388
If you would like to start your tour in Italy, where the rental    1.67495327387791
fees are actually the lowest in Europe, Fiats in all sizes are available,    1.67495327387791
as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models. If you wish to budget    1.6065767145351917
closely on transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries,    1.6065767145351917
one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus 3@    1.7026049541338664
a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station    1.3761581156320553
Wagon, seating six, at just    1.1606783668269585
$1.10 a day and 10-1/2@ a kilometer. If you will be using your car    1.7026049541338664
more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the daily rates    1.6065767145351917
drop quite sharply to 86@ a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal    1.7269387314284994
30@ a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon. With six in the    1.67495327387791
group, the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily    1.7269387314284994
fee.   In the majority of countries, however, the rates range from    1.6065767145351917
$3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00    1.7026049541338664
and $8.00 a day for the larger, luxury European models, with the rate    1.67495327387791
per kilometer driven starting at 3@ and going up as high as 12@.    1.67495327387791
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries, yet    1.67495327387791
not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate    1.67495327387791
or rate per kilometer driven. The variations are not too great. Rates    1.6432600607208703
for American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about $8.00 a day    1.6432600607208703
up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible, but the rate per    1.67495327387791
kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models.    1.6432600607208703
Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest    1.6065767145351917
in Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite high in Ireland.   1.6432600607208703
If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a    1.6065767145351917
month, it might be wise for you to lease a car. The actual over-all    1.7026049541338664
cost, for the first month, will perhaps not be too much lower than the    1.7026049541338664
rental charges for the same period of time, but you will receive a new    1.7026049541338664
car. You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner,    1.7026049541338664
which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized    1.6065767145351917
dealers throughout Europe. Further, there is no mileage charge    1.5127085093302464
or mileage limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only the flat    1.7026049541338664
monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since    1.6065767145351917
the car is registered and insured individually for your trip. There is    1.6432600607208703
a fairly wide selection of models of English, German and French manufacture    1.6432600607208703
from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7, Citroe^n    1.6432600607208703
2 ~CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca    1.4513752902486308
Beaulieu. Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a    1.7026049541338664
car in Europe, but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical    1.67495327387791
and satisfactory. After the first month, rates are considerably    1.5127085093302464
less, averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger    1.6432600607208703
models.   There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent    1.6065767145351917
cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan. For one thing, the driver    1.6432600607208703
usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes    1.67495327387791
pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road. Then,    1.7026049541338664
too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on    1.5636360329510388
the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed    1.6432600607208703
up with them. Still there is a way for those who want to see some    1.7269387314284994
of the back country of Europe by car. The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven    1.7269387314284994
car. It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.   1.6432600607208703
Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00    1.5127085093302464
a day, but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger    1.67495327387791
Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800. The big    1.6065767145351917
spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven, being governed by    1.6432600607208703
the rate at which gasoline is consumed. Since most European cars average    1.6432600607208703
more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars, it naturally    1.6065767145351917
follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less,    1.6432600607208703
but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize    1.6432600607208703
this, provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger    1.6065767145351917
limousine.   The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars    1.5127085093302464
vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for    1.67495327387791
the drive-yourself cars. However, whether you arrange to have a European    1.6065767145351917
or American model, if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity    1.67495327387791
in relation to the number of people in your party, your transportation    1.6432600607208703
expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger.    1.6065767145351917
This will include your helpful, English-speaking chauffeur and a    1.5127085093302464
drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day. If you drive greater    1.7269387314284994
distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface and will    1.6065767145351917
never discover the enchantment, fascination and beauty which lured    1.5127085093302464
you in the first place to explore the hinterlands. Of course, if you    1.67495327387791
want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac    1.7026049541338664
limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have a memorable    1.6065767145351917
tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is not recommended unless you own    1.7026049541338664
a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.   1.67495327387791
In American romance, almost nothing rates higher than what the    1.5636360329510388
movie men have called "meeting cute"- that is, boy-meets-girl    1.5127085093302464
seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct    1.67495327387791
and acute boredom. Just about the most enthralling real-life example    1.5636360329510388
of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga:    1.5127085093302464
reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts, but he said    1.7026049541338664
simultaneously, "I wish they were emeralds". Aside from the comico-romantico    1.5636360329510388
content here, a good linguist-anthropologist could readily    1.3761581156320553
pick up a few other facts, especially if he had a little more of the    1.7269387314284994
conversation to go on.   The way MacArthur said his line- if    1.6065767145351917
you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would    1.5636360329510388
probably have gone like this: **f Primary stresses on emeralds and    1.6065767145351917
wish; note pitch 3 (pretty high) on emeralds but with a slight degree    1.67495327387791
of drawl, one degree of oversoftness **h. Conclusions: The people    1.5636360329510388
involved (and subsequent facts bear me out here) knew clearly the relative    1.6432600607208703
values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary and sentimental.    1.5127085093302464
And the drawling, oversoft voice of flirtation, though fairly overt,    1.5636360329510388
was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.   In    1.6065767145351917
other words, like automation machines designed to work in tandem, they    1.6065767145351917
shared the same programming, a mutual understanding not only of English    1.6065767145351917
words, but of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can    1.6065767145351917
change their meaning from black to white. At this point, unfortunately,    1.6065767145351917
romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider,    1.6065767145351917
if you can bear it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for    1.6432600607208703
some perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark to an Eskimo    1.6432600607208703
girl in Eskimo. To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just    1.6432600607208703
so much blubber. The point- quite simply- is this: words they    1.6065767145351917
might have had; but communication, no.   This basic principle,    1.5127085093302464
the first in a richly knotted bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr& Henry    1.7026049541338664
Lee Smith, Jr&, at the University of Buffalo, where he heads    1.6065767145351917
the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics. A    1.5127085093302464
brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an ingenious system of    1.5636360329510388
spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith    1.6065767145351917
began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls- a project    1.6065767145351917
considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about "a young    1.6065767145351917
rat named Arthur, who never could make up his mind". Later, he    1.6432600607208703
became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and    1.6432600607208703
the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute.    1.4513752902486308
It was there, in the course of trying to prepare new men for the "culture    1.7269387314284994
shock" they might encounter in remote overseas posts, that he    1.5636360329510388
first began to develop a system of charting the "norms of human communication".   1.67495327387791
To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always    1.5636360329510388
revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker-    1.5127085093302464
such things as geographical origin and/or history, socio-economic identity,    1.5127085093302464
education. It is only fairly recently, however, that linguists    1.5127085093302464
have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way    1.67495327387791
that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure    1.67495327387791
of human communication between two people. This, for obvious reasons,    1.5636360329510388
makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric    1.5127085093302464
interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been successfully used    1.6065767145351917
to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.   1.67495327387791
In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished    1.5127085093302464
colleague, George Trager (so austerely academic he sometimes    1.4513752902486308
fights his own evident charm), and a third man with the engaging name    1.67495327387791
of Birdwhistell (Ray), agreed on some basic premises about the three-part    1.6065767145351917
process that makes communication: (1) words or language (2) paralanguage,    1.5636360329510388
a set of phenomena including laughing, weeping, voice breaks,    1.5127085093302464
and "tone" of voice, and (3) kinesics, the technical name for    1.6065767145351917
gestures, facial expressions, and body shifts- nodding or shaking the    1.5636360329510388
head, "talking" with one's hands, et cetera.   Smith's    1.4513752902486308
first workout with stresses, pitches, and junctures was based on mother,    1.6065767145351917
which spells, in our culture, a good deal more than bread alone.    1.6432600607208703
For example, if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there are    1.6065767145351917
certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.    1.6065767145351917
The usual U&S& norm would be: **f Middle pitches, slight    1.5636360329510388
pause (juncture) before mother, slight rise at the end. The symbols    1.6065767145351917
of mother's status, here, are all usual for culture U&S&A&.    1.5636360329510388
Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: **f Note the    1.6065767145351917
drop to pitch 1 (the lowest) on mother with no rise at the end of the    1.748515906000203
sentence; this is a "fade" ending, and what you have here is a    1.67495327387791
downtalking style of speech, expressing something less than conventional    1.5127085093302464
respect for mother. Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie    1.6432600607208703
goes with: **f In other words, the way the speaker relates to mother    1.67495327387791
is clearly indicated. And while the meaning of the words is not in    1.67495327387791
this instance altered, the quality of communication in both the second    1.6065767145351917
and third examples is definitely impaired. An accompanying record    1.5127085093302464
of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a    1.6065767145351917
throaty    1.0
rasp. With this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly    1.5127085093302464
thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling    1.67495327387791
things about himself and, in the last two examples, revealing that    1.6065767145351917
he had departed from the customs of his culture.   The joint investigations    1.6432600607208703
of linguistics and psychiatry have established, in point    1.4513752902486308
of fact, that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words    1.7026049541338664
are involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling    1.67495327387791
over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate    1.7026049541338664
to the rest of the world. Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic    1.6432600607208703
and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of    1.5127085093302464
interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions    1.6432600607208703
in new research and training. Some of the earliest recordings,    1.5636360329510388
made in the 1940's, demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately    1.5127085093302464
to anger and anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records    1.6065767145351917
of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if    1.6432600607208703
they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most    1.7026049541338664
skilled and sensitive experts. In a general way, psychiatrists were    1.5636360329510388
able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-    1.7026049541338664
that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic, that such    1.6065767145351917
things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not    1.6432600607208703
necessarily by words.   At a minimum, recording- usually on tape,    1.5636360329510388
which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview    1.6065767145351917
alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored    1.67495327387791
repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists. Newest    1.6065767145351917
to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have    1.6065767145351917
carried that minimum to a new level. By adding a systematic analysis    1.6432600607208703
with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews, they have supplied    1.6065767145351917
a new set of techniques for the therapist. Linguistic charting of    1.6065767145351917
the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs    1.5636360329510388
from expected norms. It flags such possible breakdowns of communication    1.5636360329510388
as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval, ambivalence    1.4513752902486308
or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and the disinclination to speak at    1.5636360329510388
all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.   1.6065767145351917
Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the therapist, but    1.5127085093302464
orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical    1.5127085093302464
and socio-economic background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways    1.5127085093302464
of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably    1.6065767145351917
beefed up by the linguist. His esoteric chartings of the voice alert    1.6432600607208703
the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying    1.6432600607208703
psychological difficulties, making them apparent first to the    1.4513752902486308
therapist and eventually to the patient. In one now-historic first    1.5636360329510388
interview,    1.0
for example, the transcript (reproduced from the book, <The    1.5127085093302464
First Five Minutes>) goes like this: **f The therapist's level    1.5636360329510388
tone is bland and neutral- he has, for example, avoided stressing    1.6065767145351917
"you", which would imply disapproval; or surprise, which would    1.5127085093302464
set the patient apart from other people. The patient, on the other    1.6432600607208703
hand, is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent,    1.6065767145351917
she reveals by the use of the triad, "irritable, tense, depressed",    1.6065767145351917
a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity    1.5636360329510388
with literary or scientific language (i&e&, she must have    1.5127085093302464
had at least a high-school education), and she is telling a story she    1.67495327387791
has mentally rehearsed some time before. Then she catapults into "everything    1.6065767145351917
and everybody", putting particular violence on "everybody",    1.3761581156320553
indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that    1.6432600607208703
is, it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up    1.67495327387791
to this point. Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention.    1.6432600607208703
He may then very well conclude that "everybody" is probably    1.5636360329510388
not the true target of her resentment. Immediately thereafter, the    1.5636360329510388
patient fractures her rehearsed story, veering into an oversoft, breathy,    1.5636360329510388
sloppily articulated, "I don't feel like talking right now".   1.5127085093302464
Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent    1.6065767145351917
to the therapist that "everybody" truthfully refers to the woman's    1.5636360329510388
husband. She says later, but still within the opening five minutes,    1.6065767145351917
"I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death".   1.6065767145351917
The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are    1.4513752902486308
all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain    1.6432600607208703
signals that she does not accept divorce. By saying "a<noth>er emotional    1.6065767145351917
death", she reveals that there has been a previous one, although    1.6065767145351917
she has not described it in words. This the therapist may pursue    1.6432600607208703
in    1.0
later questioning. The phrase, "emotional death", interesting and,    1.4513752902486308
to a non-scientific mind, rather touching, suggests that this woman    1.5636360329510388
may have some flair for words, perhaps even something of the temperament    1.6432600607208703
regrettably called "creative".   Since the psychiatric interview,    1.3761581156320553
like any other interview, depends on communication, it is significant    1.5636360329510388
to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked    1.67495327387791
skill and long experience. His own communication apparatus operated    1.5127085093302464
superbly, and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total    1.5636360329510388
lack of resemblance to the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of    1.5636360329510388
Dr& Blauberman. Interestingly enough- although none of the real-life    1.5127085093302464
therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman-    1.3761581156320553
when groups of them began playing back interviews, they discovered    1.5636360329510388
any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview    1.67495327387791
techniques; almost everyone, on first hearing one of his own sessions    1.6065767145351917
on tape, expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.   1.6432600607208703
Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped interviews    1.6065767145351917
by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact    1.6065767145351917
that, in the first five minutes of an initial interview, the patient    1.6432600607208703
often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him;    1.67495327387791
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively    1.5636360329510388
or scientifically how to listen. Naturally, the patient does not say,    1.6065767145351917
"I hate my father", or "Sibling rivalry is what bugs me".    1.6065767145351917
What he <does> do    1.0
is give himself away by communicating information over    1.4513752902486308
and above the words involved. Some of the classic indicators, as described    1.6432600607208703
by Drs& Pittenger, Hockett, and Danehy in <The First    1.5127085093302464
Five Minutes>, are these: _AMBIGUITY OF PRONOUNS:_ Stammering    1.4513752902486308
or repetition of <I, you, he, she>, et cetera may signal    1.6065767145351917
ambiguity    1.0
or uncertainty. On the other hand significant facts may be concealed-    1.6065767145351917
<she> may mean <I>; or <everybody>, as it did with the tense    1.6432600607208703
and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to a specific person.    1.6065767145351917
The word that is <not> used can be as important as the word that    1.7026049541338664
<is> used; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives.    1.5636360329510388
When someone says, for example, "They took ~X rays to    1.5636360329510388
see that there was nothing wrong with me", it pays to consider how    1.67495327387791
this statement would normally be made. (This patient, in actuality,    1.5636360329510388
was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the    1.67495327387791
fact    1.0
that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.)    1.748515906000203
**h Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in Durrell's    1.5127085093302464
Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke of his wife, which    1.5636360329510388
is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.   1.5127085093302464
@ She was just another freighter from the States, and she seemed    1.6065767145351917
as commonplace as her name. She was the <John Harvey,> one    1.6065767145351917
of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans,    1.6432600607208703
bombs, and bullets to the U&S& Fifteenth Air Force, to Field    1.6065767145351917
Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the    1.6065767145351917
boot of Italy in that early December of 1943.   The <John Harvey>    1.6432600607208703
arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic, on November 28th,    1.6065767145351917
making for Porto Nuovo, which, as the name indicates, was the ancient    1.6432600607208703
city's new and modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as    1.6065767145351917
she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone thought    1.6432600607208703
of the <John Harvey,> it was to observe that she was straddled by    1.67495327387791
a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit    1.7026049541338664
the <John Harvey> would likely be blown up with her own ammo and    1.67495327387791
whatever else it was that she carried.   Which was poison gas.    1.6065767145351917
It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt    1.5636360329510388
before the <John Harvey> could be loaded with 100 tons of    1.6065767145351917
mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront. For in a world    1.6432600607208703
as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas    1.6432600607208703
was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.   Throughout    1.5636360329510388
the early years of World War /2,, reports persisted that the    1.6065767145351917
Axis powers had used gas- Germany in Russia, Japan in China again.    1.6432600607208703
They were always denied. Influential people in America were warning    1.5636360329510388
the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by    1.5636360329510388
the Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so far as to    1.6432600607208703
urge our using it first. To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President    1.67495327387791
Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August:   1.5127085093302464
"From time to time since the present war began there have    1.6065767145351917
been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating    1.67495327387791
use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices    1.6065767145351917
of warfare. I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our    1.67495327387791
present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such    1.6432600607208703
terrible and inhumane weapons.   "However, evidence that the    1.4513752902486308
Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an    1.5636360329510388
intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety    1.5636360329510388
of sources.   "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the    1.6065767145351917
general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them,    1.6065767145351917
and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically    1.7269387314284994
that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such    1.6432600607208703
weapons unless they are first used by our enemies".   The    1.5636360329510388
following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave    1.6065767145351917
effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in    1.67495327387791
southern Italy. Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming    1.67495327387791
safety, but because of its proximity to airfields. Any retaliatory    1.5636360329510388
gas attack would be airborne. It would be made in three waves- the    1.67495327387791
first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the    1.7026049541338664
third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.   1.5127085093302464
So the vile cargo went into the hole of the <John Harvey>. A    1.67495327387791
detachment    1.0
of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under    1.5636360329510388
First Lt& Howard D& Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt&    1.5636360329510388
Thomas H& Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy    1.4513752902486308
was paramount. Only a few other people- very important people- knew    1.6065767145351917
of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No one else must    1.6065767145351917
know. Thus, in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that    1.7026049541338664
knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy    1.67495327387791
at Bari.   It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was growing    1.7026049541338664
dark in Bari. It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German    1.67495327387791
~Me-210    1.0
plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit. Capt&    1.6065767145351917
A& B& Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very    1.6065767145351917
worried. He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning    1.5636360329510388
to the attack in Italy. On November 24th, they had made a raid on La    1.7269387314284994
Maddalena. Two days later, some 30 of them had struck at a convoy    1.67495327387791
off Bougie, sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that    1.67495327387791
the ~Me-210 had made its first appearance. After it had reappeared    1.6065767145351917
the next two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said:   1.6065767145351917
"For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been    1.5636360329510388
over the city taking pictures. They're just waiting for the proper    1.6065767145351917
time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic".   1.6432600607208703
But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist.    1.6432600607208703
Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now    1.67495327387791
being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander    1.6065767145351917
who would conduct the "Little Blitz" on London in 1944, a    1.6065767145351917
major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered    1.7269387314284994
seriously. True, there had been raids on Naples- but Naples was    1.6065767145351917
pretty far north on the opposite coast. No, Bari was out of range.    1.67495327387791
More than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth    1.6065767145351917
Army's sector. So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch    1.6432600607208703
the scouting plane put in five more appearances, and to feel the    1.6432600607208703
certainty of this dread rising within him. For Jenks knew that Bari's    1.6432600607208703
defenses were made of paper. The Royal Air Force had but a single    1.67495327387791
light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available. There    1.5127085093302464
were no R&A&F& fighter squadrons on Bari airfield. The    1.5127085093302464
radar station with the best location was still not serviceable. Telephone    1.6065767145351917
communication was bad. And everywhere in evidence among the few    1.5636360329510388
remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple    1.5636360329510388
command.   It had been made shockingly evident that very morning    1.5636360329510388
to Ensign Kay K& Vesole, in charge of the armed guard aboard the    1.67495327387791
<John Bascom>. A British officer had come aboard and told him    1.6065767145351917
that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs    1.7269387314284994
were actually dropped. Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a    1.6432600607208703
radar-controlled    1.0
shore gun firing white tracers.   "This harbor is    1.4513752902486308
a bomber's paradise", the Britisher had said with frank grimness.    1.5636360329510388
"It's up to you to protect yourselves. We can't expect any    1.6065767145351917
help from the fighters at Foggia, either. They're all being used on    1.6432600607208703
offensive missions".   Vesole had been stunned. Not fire until    1.5127085093302464
the bombs came down! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable    1.67495327387791
fluid beneath his feet and shook his head. Like hell! Like hell    1.6432600607208703
he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out?    1.5636360329510388
What would his guns guide on then- the North Star? Ensign    1.6065767145351917
Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering    1.6432600607208703
of the bombs, and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/~c Donald    1.7026049541338664
L& Norton and Seaman 1/~c William A& Rochford on the guns    1.6065767145351917
and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette.    1.67495327387791
Below decks, Seaman 1/~c Stanley Bishop had begun to write    1.5636360329510388
Above decks on the <John Harvey,> Lieutenant    1.3761581156320553
Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and    1.6432600607208703
felt uneasy. There were lights glinting in the city, too, even though    1.6432600607208703
it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible. Bari was    1.7026049541338664
asking for it, he thought.   For five days now, they had been    1.6432600607208703
in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold. Richardson wondered    1.67495327387791
when it would be unloaded. He hoped they would put it somewhere way,    1.67495327387791
way down in the earth. The burden of his secret was pressing down    1.67495327387791
on him, as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men.    1.67495327387791
Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the <John    1.6065767145351917
Harvey> in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing    1.5636360329510388
more dangerous than high explosive bombs. They seemed happy at the    1.6065767145351917
delay in unloading, glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty    1.7026049541338664
port such as Bari. Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.    1.67495327387791
Deck Cadet James L& Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had    1.5636360329510388
been the first to leave. Richardson had returned their departing grins    1.6065767145351917
with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in    1.6065767145351917
trade.   The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his men,    1.6432600607208703
had remained aboard. Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly.    1.5636360329510388
Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor-    1.67495327387791
Porto Vecchio. The night was so clear that Richardson had no    1.6065767145351917
difficulty making out the silhouette. Then the thought of a cloudless    1.6065767145351917
sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward. His eyes boggled.   1.6065767145351917
It was a clear night and it was raining!   Capt& Michael    1.6065767145351917
A& Musmanno, Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula, had    1.5127085093302464
also seen and felt the "rain". But he had mistaken it for bugs.   1.67495327387791
Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant    1.3761581156320553
name <Unsinkable> had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed    1.6432600607208703
olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population. Musmanno    1.4513752902486308
was on deck. At exactly 7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush    1.6432600607208703
his face. He snatched at it savagely. He turned the beam of his flashlight    1.7026049541338664
on it. He laughed. It was the silver foil from the chocolate    1.6432600607208703
bar he had been eating. He frowned. But how could-? Another,    1.6065767145351917
longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth. It was two feet long. It was    1.7026049541338664
not candy wrapping.   It was "window"- the tinsel paper    1.5127085093302464
dropped by bombers to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds    1.67495327387791
of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.   "Fermate"!    1.5636360329510388
Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen. "Stop! Stop    1.4513752902486308
the engines"!   <Unsinkable> slowed and stopped, hundreds    1.3761581156320553
of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the air    1.6432600607208703
raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the anti-aircraft guns coughed    1.6432600607208703
and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came    1.6432600607208703
whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor    1.6065767145351917
at Bari.   They had come from airports in the Balkans, these    1.6065767145351917
hundred-odd Junkers 88's. They had winged over the Adriatic, they    1.5636360329510388
had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her,    1.6432600607208703
attacking with deadly skill. They had ruined the radar warning system    1.6065767145351917
with their window, they had made themselves invisible above their flares.    1.6065767145351917
And they also had the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns,    1.67495327387791
and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on. After the first two    1.6432600607208703
were blacked out, the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian    1.6432600607208703
crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring    1.67495327387791
homing beacon until British ~MP's shot it out.   In that    1.5636360329510388
interval, the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor.   Merchant    1.6065767145351917
ships illuminated in the light of the flares, made to seem like    1.6432600607208703
stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud, were impossible to miss.    1.6432600607208703
The little <Unsinkable> sank almost immediately. Captain Musmanno    1.4513752902486308
roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for    1.7269387314284994
a raft. They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few    1.7026049541338664
minutes before their schooner went under.   <John Bascom>    1.4513752902486308
went down early, too. Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly,    1.6432600607208703
but they had no targets. Most of the Junkers were above the    1.6432600607208703
blinding light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore gun had    1.6065767145351917
been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs. Vesole rushed    1.67495327387791
from gun to gun, attempting to direct fire. He was wounded, but fought    1.67495327387791
on. Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.    1.6432600607208703
Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20~mm gun, pumping out 400 rounds    1.67495327387791
before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One, Three and    1.6432600607208703
Five. Now the <Bascom> was mortally wounded. Luckily, she was    1.5636360329510388
not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.   1.6432600607208703
The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of pain could    1.6432600607208703
be heard from the wounded below decks.   1.3761581156320553
THERE IS a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at    1.6432600607208703
you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed in amazement. You explain,    1.6065767145351917
"I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this    1.5636360329510388
very same event before. I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed    1.67495327387791
this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in    1.6065767145351917
the past"!   This experience will have happened to many of    1.5636360329510388
you.   Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "**h startling experience    1.6065767145351917
which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular    1.5127085093302464
passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same    1.6432600607208703
order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have    1.6065767145351917
been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard    1.6065767145351917
precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when".   1.6065767145351917
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling    1.5127085093302464
as the <deja vue (already seen)> illusion, just as they dismiss    1.6065767145351917
dream previsions as coincidences. In this manner they side-step the seemingly    1.6065767145351917
hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which    1.5636360329510388
all of us grope continually.   When a man recognizes a certain    1.6065767145351917
experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance    1.67495327387791
of <deja vue>,    1.0
except for the fact that he knows just why the experience    1.6065767145351917
seems familiar. Occasionally there are examples of prevision    1.4513752902486308
which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.   1.5636360329510388
One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an event    1.5636360329510388
which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream, detailed    1.6432600607208703
the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion    1.5636360329510388
was completely mystified.   Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the "jargon"    1.5127085093302464
of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered    1.5127085093302464
"**h how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life    1.7026049541338664
film"? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in <Something    1.6432600607208703
About Myself>.   One day when he attended a war memorial    1.5636360329510388
ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout    1.6065767145351917
man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the    1.67495327387791
rough slab flooring and someone, clasping him by the arm, whispered,    1.6065767145351917
"I want a word with you, please". At that moment Kipling was    1.6432600607208703
overwhelmed with awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical    1.5127085093302464
details of scene, action and word had occurred to him in a dream six    1.7026049541338664
weeks earlier.   Freud probably contributed more than anyone else    1.5127085093302464
to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents    1.6065767145351917
in our wakeful thoughts. However, readers who accept Freud's    1.5127085093302464
findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of    1.6065767145351917
dreams, should ponder over the following words in his <Interpretation    1.5636360329510388
Of Dreams,> Chapter /1,: "**h as a matter of fact no such    1.6432600607208703
complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case,    1.6432600607208703
and what is more, every one attempting such solution has found that    1.6432600607208703
in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream    1.67495327387791
the source of which he has been unable to explain **h nor is the discussion    1.7269387314284994
closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams".   1.6432600607208703
Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance,    1.3761581156320553
prevision and retrovision. <The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces    1.5636360329510388
all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical    1.6432600607208703
dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual continuities>.   1.6065767145351917
I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream in which I    1.6432600607208703
lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town. I am    1.7026049541338664
sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence,    1.6432600607208703
so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news pictures    1.5636360329510388
I have seen. And when psychology explains glibly, "but the subconscious    1.6065767145351917
mind is able to produce it" it refers to a mental region so vaguely    1.7026049541338664
identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably    1.6065767145351917
as part of the individual mind.   Skeptics may deny the    1.5636360329510388
more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally    1.6065767145351917
observed, but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance    1.6432600607208703
of routine evidence.   The question becomes, "What is    1.4513752902486308
a dream"?   Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?   1.6065767145351917
Every dream, and this is true of a mental image of any type    1.67495327387791
even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful    1.6432600607208703
thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.    1.6065767145351917
In most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals or objects.    1.6065767145351917
But these are dreamed in original action, in some particular continuity    1.6065767145351917
which we don't remember having seen in real life. For instance,    1.6065767145351917
the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with    1.5636360329510388
photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car; whereas, it is    1.5636360329510388
a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car. There is nothing to    1.7026049541338664
suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original,    1.67495327387791
realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.   1.5127085093302464
The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of    1.6065767145351917
a mental image can find no logical support. <A "mental image" subconsciously    1.6432600607208703
impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful    1.5127085093302464
thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at    1.6432600607208703
all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory    1.6432600607208703
stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension>.   Dreams    1.5636360329510388
that display events of the future with photographic detail call    1.5636360329510388
for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including    1.6432600607208703
that weird feeling of <deja vue>, inevitably fantastic though    1.5127085093302464
that theory must seem.   As in the theory of perception, established    1.6065767145351917
in psycho-physiology, the eye is recognized as an integral part    1.5636360329510388
of the brain. But then this theory confesses that it is completely at    1.67495327387791
a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain. The    1.7269387314284994
opening paragraph of the chapter titled <The Theory Of Representative    1.5636360329510388
Perception,> in the book <Philosophies Of Science> by    1.4513752902486308
Albert G& Ramsperger says, "**h passed on to the brain, and there,    1.6432600607208703
by some unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception".   1.6432600607208703
But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image    1.5636360329510388
within the brain? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral    1.6432600607208703
function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between    1.67495327387791
the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation    1.6432600607208703
from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the    1.6065767145351917
transmission    1.0
of an image which is already in required location. Hereby,    1.5636360329510388
the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen,    1.67495327387791
not the retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive    1.67495327387791
cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory    1.5127085093302464
centers, motor tensions, associated word symbols, and consciousness.   1.4513752902486308
Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists    1.5636360329510388
of minute waves of energy. We know that the number of radio and    1.67495327387791
television impulses, sound waves, ultra-violet rays, etc&, that may    1.5127085093302464
occupy    1.0
the very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency, is infinite.    1.6432600607208703
So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal,    1.6432600607208703
apparently momentary states of matter, successive one after    1.4513752902486308
another in consciousness, but permanent each on its own basic phase of    1.6432600607208703
the progressive frequencies. This theory makes it possible for any    1.5636360329510388
event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to    1.6065767145351917
consciousness.   Space in any form is completely measured by the    1.5636360329510388
three dimensions. If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and    1.6065767145351917
not purely metaphysical, through what medium does it extend? It is    1.6065767145351917
not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science    1.67495327387791
fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past,    1.6065767145351917
or the ever-existent past-fantasy future. Three seconds flat is the    1.5636360329510388
usual time, and the space is crossed by moderate mileage, while the    1.6432600607208703
overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static    1.6065767145351917
pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which    1.5127085093302464
perpetuate all events.   The body, senses and brain, in common with    1.6065767145351917
all matter, have their counterpart on each of a countless number of    1.6432600607208703
frequencies. The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only    1.5636360329510388
of phenomena that share its own frequency, whereas those upon all other    1.6432600607208703
frequencies are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them. Consciousness    1.5127085093302464
is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory    1.5636360329510388
impressions. When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the    1.5127085093302464
wakeful world, it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present    1.6065767145351917
past and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one left    1.7026049541338664
when the body tired and required sleep.   If the photographically    1.5636360329510388
realistic continuity of dreams, however bizarre their combinations,    1.4513752902486308
denies that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must be compounded    1.7026049541338664
from views of diverse realities, although some of them may never    1.6065767145351917
be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.   Dr&    1.67495327387791
H& V& Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University    1.5127085093302464
of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with    1.5127085093302464
the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B&C&) escorted him to the treasure    1.5636360329510388
chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information    1.67495327387791
about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification.    1.6432600607208703
As a matter of fact, the incorrect classification, the result    1.5636360329510388
of many weeks of labor by Dr& Hilprecht, was about to be published    1.67495327387791
by him the following day. Some time later the missing part of the relic    1.7026049541338664
was found and the complete inscription, together with other new evidence,    1.6065767145351917
fully corroborated the ancient priest's information. Dr&    1.3761581156320553
Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest    1.6432600607208703
in his dream. He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite,    1.67495327387791
and imagined it must have been German or English.   We may    1.6065767145351917
conclude that all six points of information, ostensibly given by the    1.6065767145351917
dream priest, <could have> been furnished by Dr& Hilprecht's    1.5127085093302464
<subconscious> reasoning. But, in denying any physical reality for    1.5127085093302464
this dream, how could the brain possibly compose that realistic, vividly    1.6065767145351917
visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout, violent break or    1.5127085093302464
sudden substitution? Which theory is more fantastic: 1. that the    1.5636360329510388
perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions    1.5636360329510388
in the professor's brain, or 2. that the dream was a reality on the    1.7026049541338664
infinite progressions of universal, gradient frequencies, across which    1.4513752902486308
the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met?   1.5636360329510388
The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines    1.6065767145351917
whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or    1.5636360329510388
the vaguely, effective source of the weird <deja vue> feeling. No    1.6065767145351917
doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the    1.67495327387791
sleeper's mind. Probably less than one percent of our previsions    1.5636360329510388
escape final obliteration before we wake. When we arrive at the events    1.6432600607208703
concerned in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress    1.5636360329510388
us as anything familiar. Nevertheless, there are notably frequent    1.5127085093302464
instances of <deja vue,> in which our recognition of an entirely novel    1.6432600607208703
event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which,    1.67495327387791
though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive    1.5636360329510388
corps of psychologists. If <deja vue> is an illusion, then peculiarly,    1.6065767145351917
it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most    1.6065767145351917
level-headed people.   Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for    1.3761581156320553
the Republican Presidential nomination, was attending a convention    1.4513752902486308
at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt    1.6065767145351917
for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary    1.6065767145351917
chairman was a man he had never met. After the preliminary business    1.6432600607208703
affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech    1.5636360329510388
that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt. If Depew had told any    1.6065767145351917
academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through    1.6432600607208703
that identical convention session at some time in the past, he would    1.6432600607208703
have been informed that he was a victim of <deja vue>. But the famous    1.7026049541338664
orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene. He remembered    1.6065767145351917
exactly when he had lived through it before, and he had something    1.6432600607208703
to prove he had.   One week before the convention, Depew was    1.6065767145351917
seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing at the opposite    1.7269387314284994
shore.   1.0
"THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL and it is a lot of fun to be here"!   1.7026049541338664
So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents    1.67495327387791
from North Country School, Lake Placid, New York. In this    1.5636360329510388
one sentence, he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition    1.6065767145351917
and psychological programs in operation at the school.   Because    1.5127085093302464
the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value, care    1.6065767145351917
for its origin, and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients,    1.67495327387791
the food <does> taste good. When served in a psychological    1.5636360329510388
atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from    1.6065767145351917
what they eat because they are free from tension, a foundation is laid    1.67495327387791
for a high level of health that releases the children from physical    1.6432600607208703
handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments, the    1.5636360329510388
athletic programs and the most important phase, the educational opportunities.   1.5636360329510388
Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain    1.5636360329510388
scenery in the country, the school buildings are located amid open    1.6065767145351917
fields    1.0
and farm lands. These contemporary structures, beautifully adapted to    1.5127085093302464
a school in the country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen,    1.7026049541338664
grades four through eight. From fourteen states and three foreign    1.5636360329510388
countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June.   1.6065767145351917
The Director, Walter E& Clark, believes that a school    1.5127085093302464
with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility    1.6432600607208703
for their welfare. To him this means caring for the whole child,    1.6432600607208703
providing basic nutrition, and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom    1.5636360329510388
for the development of the mind.    1.2818970554302986
The    1.0
concept of good nutrition really began with the garden. The school has    1.6432600607208703
always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school. In a climate    1.7026049541338664
hostile to agriculture, Mr& Clark has had to keep alert to the    1.6432600607208703
most productive farm techniques.   Where a growing season may,    1.5127085093302464
with luck, allow 60 days without frost, and where the soil is poor,    1.67495327387791
sandy, quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail. Throughout    1.5636360329510388
the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear    1.5636360329510388
ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.   Mr& Clark    1.5127085093302464
found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing, use of chemical fertilizers    1.6065767145351917
and insecticides, plus the application of conservation principles    1.4513752902486308
of rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato    1.6432600607208703
fields and depreciation of the soil.   "To give up these    1.5636360329510388
notions required a revolution in thought", Mr& Clark said in reminiscing    1.6065767145351917
about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began    1.6065767145351917
reading "Organic Gardening" and "Modern Nutrition" in a    1.4513752902486308
search for help with his problems.   "Louis Bromfield's writings    1.5127085093302464
excited me as a conservationist". By 1952 he was convinced he    1.6065767145351917
would no longer spray. He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it    1.67495327387791
still remains. After reading "Plowman's Folly" by Edward H&    1.5127085093302464
Faulkner, he stopped plowing.   The basis for compost materials    1.5127085093302464
already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the    1.67495327387791
riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage, a beef herd    1.6432600607208703
and wastes of all kinds. Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for    1.67495327387791
coffee grounds and egg shells.   All these materials and supplementary    1.5636360329510388
manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry    1.5127085093302464
farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year. It was applied    1.67495327387791
with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader.    1.5636360329510388
Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed    1.6065767145351917
the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity. Soon after    1.6065767145351917
the method changed, visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate    1.6065767145351917
his soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it was the soil treatment    1.7269387314284994
alone that accomplished this.   To demonstrate the soil    1.4513752902486308
of his vegetable gardens as it is today, Mr& Clark stooped to scoop    1.67495327387791
up a handful of rich dark earth. Sniffing its sweet smell and letting    1.67495327387791
it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed to the nearby    1.67495327387791
driveway and said, "This soil used to be like that hard packed    1.6432600607208703
road over there".   "People and soils respond slowly", says    1.5127085093302464
Walter Clark, "but the time has now come when the gardens produce    1.6432600607208703
delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program. No    1.5127085093302464
chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are    1.4513752902486308
used".   The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas,    1.4513752902486308
potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the    1.6432600607208703
root cellar. The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter;    1.6065767145351917
the cabbage and squash keep until March or April. There is never    1.6432600607208703
enough corn, peas or strawberries.   Mr& Clark still has    1.5127085093302464
to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields, but he    1.67495327387791
has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued    1.6065767145351917
use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in    1.7026049541338664
the    1.0
future. A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter.   1.6065767145351917
New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil    1.6065767145351917
treatment. "After the soil, the kitchen", says Mr& Clark. The    1.5636360329510388
first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of    1.6065767145351917
white bread.   "Adults take a long time to convince and you are    1.6432600607208703
thwarted if you try to push". At first the kitchen help was tolerant,    1.67495327387791
but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves. "You    1.6065767145351917
can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread", was an early    1.5636360329510388
complaint. Of course they learned in time that they not only could use    1.67495327387791
whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better.    1.4513752902486308
Mrs& Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and cared for    1.6065767145351917
the ordering. Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be    1.6065767145351917
kitchen manager. Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and    1.6065767145351917
baked into bread. Mr& Clark's studies taught him that the only    1.6065767145351917
way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the    1.7026049541338664
flour. Once the grains are ground, vitamin ~E begins to deteriorate    1.6065767145351917
immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the    1.67495327387791
air within one week.   A mill stands in a room off the kitchen.    1.67495327387791
Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in    1.6432600607208703
the state. Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat, oats, and soy    1.6432600607208703
beans and turns on the motor. She goes on about her work and listens    1.7026049541338664
for the completion of the grinding. The bread baked from this mixture    1.6432600607208703
is light in color and fragrant in aroma. It is well liked by the children    1.7269387314284994
and faculty.   There is one problem with the bread. "Lillian's    1.5636360329510388
bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here    1.6065767145351917
that it is hard not to eat too much", said the secretary ruefully eyeing    1.7026049541338664
her extra pounds.    1.0
The school has    1.0
not used cold prepared cereals for years, though at one time that was    1.67495327387791
all they ever served. When the chance came, they first eliminated    1.6065767145351917
cold cereal once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground    1.6065767145351917
cereal every day.   They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal.    1.5636360329510388
Occasionally, the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal    1.5127085093302464
which they call "buckshot". At the beginning of the school year,    1.6065767145351917
the new students don't eat the cereal right away, but within a short    1.67495327387791
time they are eating it voraciously.   When they leave for vacations    1.6065767145351917
they miss the hot cereal. The school has received letters from    1.6065767145351917
parents asking, "What happened to Johnny? He never used to like    1.6065767145351917
any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants. Where can we    1.67495327387791
get this cereal he likes so much"?    1.3761581156320553
Salads    1.0
are served at least once a day. Vegetables are served liberally. Most    1.6432600607208703
come from the root cellar or from the freezer. Home-made sauerkraut    1.6065767145351917
is served once a week. Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads    1.67495327387791
and dishes such as chop suey. Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to    1.6432600607208703
bread and causes the children to remark, "Lillian, did you put nuts    1.6432600607208703
in the bread today"?   Milk appears twice a day. The school    1.6065767145351917
raises enough poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs.    1.6432600607208703
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served. Hens are kept    1.67495327387791
on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility.   1.6432600607208703
Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue and heart are    1.6432600607208703
planned once a week. Also, salt water fish is on the table once a week.   1.7269387314284994
For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once a week.    1.6065767145351917
Most other desserts are fruit in some form, fresh fruits once daily    1.6432600607208703
at least, sometimes at snack time. Dried fruits are purchased from sources    1.6432600607208703
where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed. Apples come    1.5127085093302464
from    1.0
a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed. Oranges and grapefruit    1.6432600607208703
are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm.   Finding    1.5636360329510388
sources for these high quality foods is a problem. Sometimes the    1.6065767145351917
solution comes in unexpected ways. Following a talk by Mr& Clark    1.6065767145351917
at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man    1.6065767145351917
from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school    1.6432600607208703
from Vermont.   Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are    1.5127085093302464
used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat loaves. Miss    1.67495327387791
Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available    1.6432600607208703
at the tables. Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table    1.6065767145351917
for the children to help themselves.   Very few fried foods are    1.6065767145351917
used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged. Drinking with meals    1.67495327387791
is also discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables.   1.6065767145351917
Nothing is peeled. The source is known so there is no necessity    1.6432600607208703
to remove insecticide residues. The cooking conserves a maximum    1.5127085093302464
of the vitamin ~C content of vegetables by methods which use very    1.6432600607208703
little water and cook in the shortest time possible.    1.5127085093302464
Since Mr& Clark believes firmly that the chewing    1.4513752902486308
of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw vegetables and    1.6432600607208703
raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat    1.6065767145351917
cookies at snack time in the afternoons. To solve the problem of the    1.67495327387791
wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot, a ball of    1.6432600607208703
maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.   1.6432600607208703
On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains, the children    1.5636360329510388
carry whole grains to munch along the trail. They learn to like    1.6432600607208703
these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the    1.7026049541338664
oats he was feeding his horse at chore time. They tasted good to him,    1.7026049541338664
so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk    1.7026049541338664
and honey.   Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods    1.6432600607208703
on the school grounds. This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar    1.6432600607208703
on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking. Candy is    1.67495327387791
not allowed. Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats    1.67495327387791
consisting of fruit and nuts, but no candy.    1.4513752902486308
Mr& Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit, hot cereal,    1.6432600607208703
milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs. The heavy    1.6065767145351917
meal comes in the middle of the day. Soup is often the important dish    1.7026049541338664
at supper. Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich in dissolved    1.67495327387791
minerals and vitamins.   The school finds that the children    1.5127085093302464
are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high    1.67495327387791
in quality. The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a    1.7026049541338664
day.    1.0
Even before he saw the necessity of growing    1.4513752902486308
better food and planning good nutrition, Mr& Clark felt the school    1.6065767145351917
had a good health program. Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and    1.6432600607208703
a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule. A vigorous    1.7026049541338664
program existed in skiing, skating sports and overnight hiking.    1.5127085093302464
Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he    1.5127085093302464
can report on improvements in health, though he considers the following    1.6065767145351917
statements observations and not scientific proof.   Visitors to    1.4513752902486308
the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring    1.67495327387791
out the sheen. The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.   1.6432600607208703
BUFFETED by swirling winds, the little green biplane struggled    1.5127085093302464
northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf. Wires    1.4513752902486308
whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine    1.67495327387791
roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He    1.6432600607208703
peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again    1.6432600607208703
below.   "Good old iron compass"! he thought.   A plume    1.5127085093302464
of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind    1.6065767145351917
a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored    1.6432600607208703
to set the ruptured roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered    1.6432600607208703
Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's    1.6065767145351917
main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days after the Great    1.67495327387791
Flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster in the state's    1.5636360329510388
history-    1.0
the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United    1.6065767145351917
States mails.   Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen    1.5127085093302464
for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday,    1.7026049541338664
November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's    1.5636360329510388
Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for    1.5127085093302464
Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters    1.5636360329510388
shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still had offices-    1.6065767145351917
and wondered how to move the mail. The state's railroad system    1.6065767145351917
counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way: it would    1.5636360329510388
obviously remain out of commission for weeks. And once medicine,    1.5636360329510388
food, clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims,    1.6065767145351917
communications and the mail were the next top problems.   From    1.5636360329510388
Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain    1.5127085093302464
to the railroad at Port Kent, N& Y&. But what came in was piling    1.7026049541338664
up. The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord,    1.6432600607208703
N& H&. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National    1.5636360329510388
Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed    1.7026049541338664
a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that    1.5127085093302464
at Montpelier too.   The question was "Where to land"?    1.5127085093302464
There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator    1.6432600607208703
John J& Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort    1.5636360329510388
Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots    1.5636360329510388
were bringing their wide-winged "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters    1.4513752902486308
to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.   The only    1.6432600607208703
available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was    1.5636360329510388
on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where    1.6432600607208703
takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions.    1.6432600607208703
Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water, and    1.6432600607208703
bridges were crumpled and gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines    1.5127085093302464
and yeast by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee    1.6065767145351917
and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry, Vermont National    1.6432600607208703
Guard, laid out runways on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill.    1.6065767145351917
The "Barre Aviation Field" was set to receive its first    1.5636360329510388
aircraft the Sunday following the flood.   Though the makeshift    1.5127085093302464
airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to    1.6065767145351917
keep any kind of mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training    1.67495327387791
consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out of established    1.6432600607208703
airports, And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with    1.5636360329510388
the water cooled engines of their World War /1, planes. It seemed    1.6432600607208703
like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering    1.6432600607208703
the post office department to contract for the transport of first    1.6065767145351917
class mail by air. They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the    1.7026049541338664
terminals.   Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier    1.5127085093302464
in the right place at the right time: Robert S& Fogg, a native    1.67495327387791
New Englander, had been a World War /1, flying instructor, barnstormer,    1.6065767145351917
and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport. Tall,    1.6065767145351917
wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical    1.5636360329510388
first in air mail history. Piloting a Curtiss Navy ~MF flying    1.6065767145351917
boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the original    1.6065767145351917
Rural Delivery air service in America.   During the excitement    1.5127085093302464
following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil    1.5636360329510388
aviators overnight became legendary heroes. In Concord, Bob    1.4513752902486308
Fogg    1.0
was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings. Public-spirited    1.5636360329510388
backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at putting their    1.6065767145351917
city and state on the flying map. The ship was a Waco biplane, one    1.7026049541338664
of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225~HP    1.7269387314284994
Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind. A trim green and silver-painted    1.6432600607208703
craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the Waco was entered to    1.5636360329510388
compete in the "On-to-Spokane" Air Derby of 1927. As a matter    1.6065767145351917
of fact, Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the    1.6432600607208703
race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service    1.6432600607208703
and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his    1.6432600607208703
wry-faced backers. So with all this experience, Bob Fogg was a natural    1.6432600607208703
choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract.    1.6065767145351917
His work began just six days after the flood.   By airline    1.6065767145351917
from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles, counting    1.6432600607208703
a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier.    1.6065767145351917
The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back    1.7026049541338664
of the State House when the wind was right, and used Wilson flat    1.67495327387791
above Barre when it wasn't. Between the unsafe Towne field and the    1.6432600607208703
long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to    1.6432600607208703
Wilson flat, arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.    1.6065767145351917
Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck, begged the postal    1.6432600607208703
officials that met him to find a safer landing place, preferably    1.6065767145351917
on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River.   "But    1.5127085093302464
Fogg", they countered, "we can't get over there. And besides you    1.6065767145351917
seem to make it all right here". It took a tragedy to bring things    1.7026049541338664
to a head. After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind    1.6432600607208703
takeoffs, Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage    1.6065767145351917
of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field. Sent to    1.6065767145351917
Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red Cross Aide Reuben    1.5127085093302464
Sleight had been killed, and his pilot, Lt& Franklin Wolfe, badly    1.6065767145351917
injured. With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply    1.67495327387791
flown into the hillside.   Faced with this situation, Postmaster    1.5127085093302464
Charles F& McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington    1.6065767145351917
trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the heights    1.5636360329510388
of Berlin. A long flat known as the St& John field seemed to answer    1.7026049541338664
their purpose, and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable,    1.6065767145351917
they decided to use it.   With a wary eye on the farmer's    1.6432600607208703
bull, Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr& St& John marked the    1.6065767145351917
field with a red table cloth. As a wind direction indicator, they tied    1.67495327387791
a cotton rag to a sapling. With these aids, and a pair of skiis substituting    1.7269387314284994
for wheels on the Waco, Bob Fogg made the first landing on    1.6432600607208703
what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21,    1.6065767145351917
1927.   Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail    1.6065767145351917
pouches. During the second week of operations, Fogg received a telegram    1.6065767145351917
from the Post Office Department, asking him to "put on two airplanes    1.6432600607208703
and make two flights daily, plus one Sunday trip". Since    1.5636360329510388
Fogg's was a one-man, one-plane flying service, this meant that he    1.6065767145351917
would have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day, under sub-freezing    1.7026049541338664
temperature conditions.   Over the weeks, America's    1.2818970554302986
first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the    1.6432600607208703
vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.    1.67495327387791
Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into    1.6432600607208703
flying togs over the furnace register of his home. Always troubled    1.6065767145351917
by poor circulation in his feet, he experimented with various combinations    1.6065767145351917
of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's    1.5636360329510388
boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them. A sheep-lined    1.6065767145351917
leather flying suit, plus helmet, goggles and mittens completed    1.5127085093302464
his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit. The airman's stock answer    1.67495327387791
to "Weren't you cold"? became "Yes, the first half hour    1.5636360329510388
is tough, but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it"!   1.6432600607208703
As daylight began to show through the frosty windows, Fogg would    1.6065767145351917
place a call to William A& Shaw at the U& S& Weather Station    1.67495327387791
at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature and wind-velocity readings.    1.4513752902486308
Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility    1.67495327387791
by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.    1.67495327387791
"Ceilings" were judged by comparison with known mountain heights    1.5127085093302464
and cloud positions. Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather    1.7026049541338664
picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank    1.5127085093302464
E& Hartwell.   Out at the airport each morning, Fogg's    1.5127085093302464
skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running    1.6432600607208703
in the drafty hangar. (He'd get the engine oil flowing with an    1.6432600607208703
electric heater under a big canvas cover.) Wishing to show that aviation    1.6432600607208703
was dependable and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point    1.6432600607208703
of taking off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding rain, snow    1.67495327387791
and sleet in true postal tradition. Concord learned to set its clocks    1.6432600607208703
by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead. Sometimes    1.5636360329510388
the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his    1.7269387314284994
trips were completed.   Plane radios were not yet available,    1.5127085093302464
and once in the air, Fogg flew his ship by compass, a good memory for    1.7269387314284994
landmarks as seen from above, and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick    1.67495327387791
computation. Often, threading through the overcast, he was forced    1.5127085093302464
to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski    1.7026049541338664
or the White River along the line of the broken railroad. When    1.6432600607208703
driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg would chandelle up    1.6432600607208703
and over to reverse course and try another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee    1.67495327387791
up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain    1.6065767145351917
passes.   The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on    1.5127085093302464
these trips. It ticked over smoothly, idling while Fogg exchanged    1.5636360329510388
mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen,    1.6065767145351917
and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St& John field.   1.6065767145351917
Sometimes, on a return trip, the aviator would "go upstairs" high    1.6065767145351917
over the clouds. There he'd take a compass heading, figure his    1.6065767145351917
air speed, and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over    1.7026049541338664
the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe    1.6432600607208703
to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.    1.7026049541338664
Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight    1.5127085093302464
and Ground Control Approach systems. At the end of the calculated    1.6065767145351917
time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break    1.7026049541338664
through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.   1.6065767145351917
Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just time    1.5636360329510388
to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab a bit of Mrs& Fogg's    1.67495327387791
hot broth before starting the second trip. Day after day Fogg shuttled    1.6432600607208703
back and forth on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers    1.6432600607208703
in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the    1.6432600607208703
stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.   The    1.6432600607208703
flyer had his share of near-misses. At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present    1.6432600607208703
wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing    1.6065767145351917
like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated. Once the soldiers from    1.6065767145351917
the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved    1.67495327387791
the engine and got the tail up. At a nod of his head they let go,    1.748515906000203
turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream. Tracks in the    1.6432600607208703
snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet.   1.6432600607208703
One afternoon during a cold, powdery snowstorm, Fogg took off for    1.6065767145351917
Concord from the St& John field.    1.2818970554302986
{A}re you retiring now? If so, are you saying, "Where did    1.6065767145351917
the last    1.0
few years go? How did I get to be sixty-five so fast? What do    1.7026049541338664
I do now"?   Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.    1.6065767145351917
Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire. We always    1.6065767145351917
thought we would die with our boots on. Out of the blue comes talk    1.7026049541338664
of pension plans. Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our    1.5636360329510388
horizon. Still, it seems in the far future. Suddenly, one day, up it    1.67495327387791
pops! Sixty-five years and you've had it!   So, now what?    1.5636360329510388
Oh sure! You've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way.    1.67495327387791
But! It never seemed real; never seemed as if it could happen    1.6432600607208703
to you; only to the other fellow.   Now! Here it is! How    1.6432600607208703
am I going to live? What am I going to do? Where do I go from    1.748515906000203
here?   A great many retired people are the so-called white    1.5636360329510388
collar workers. Are you one of these?   If so, you are of the    1.67495327387791
old school. You are conscientious, hard working, honest, accurate,    1.5127085093302464
a good penman, and a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends.    1.7269387314284994
Everything must balance to the last penny. Also you can spell, without    1.6432600607208703
consulting a dictionary for every other word. You never are late    1.6065767145351917
{Actually, you can take no special    1.2818970554302986
credit for this.} It is the way you were taught and your way of    1.7026049541338664
life. All this is standard equipment for a man of your day; your stock    1.7026049541338664
in trade; your livelihood.   However, the last few years    1.5127085093302464
of your life, things seem to be changing. Your way doesn't seem to    1.67495327387791
be so darned important any more. You realize you are getting in the old    1.7026049541338664
fogy class. To put it bluntly, you are getting out-moded.   What's    1.6065767145351917
happened? The answer is a new era.   Now, looming on    1.5636360329510388
the horizon are such things as estimated totals, calculated risks and    1.6065767145351917
I&B&M& machines. The Planning Dept& comes into existence.    1.4513752902486308
All sorts of plans come to life. This is followed by a boom in conferences.    1.7269387314284994
Yes sir! Conferences become very popular. When a plan    1.5127085093302464
burst its seams, hasty conferences supply the necessary patch, and life    1.6065767145351917
goes merrily on. That's called progress! The new way of life!    1.6065767145351917
Let's face it! You had your day and it was a good day. Let this    1.7269387314284994
generation have theirs. Time marches on!   Well, to get back    1.5636360329510388
to the problem of retirement. Every retiring person has a different    1.6065767145351917
situation facing him. Some have plenty of money- some have very little    1.6432600607208703
money. Some are blest with an abundance of good health- some    1.6065767145351917
are in poor health and many are invalids. Some have lovely homes-    1.6432600607208703
some live in small apartments. Some have beautiful gardens- some not    1.6065767145351917
even a blade of grass. Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept    1.7026049541338664
what they have, and make the most of it (a wonderful gift to have,    1.7026049541338664
believe me)- some see only darkness, the bitter side of everything.    1.6065767145351917
Well, whatever you have, that's it! You've got to learn to    1.6065767145351917
live with it.   Now! The question is "How are you going to    1.6432600607208703
{You can sit back and moan and bewail your    1.5127085093302464
lot.} Yes! You can do this. But, if you do, your life will    1.67495327387791
be just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.   It    1.5127085093302464
seems to me, the first thing you've got to do, to be happy, is to    1.7269387314284994
face up to your problems, no matter what they may be. Make up your mind    1.7269387314284994
to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years    1.67495327387791
of life. One thing, I am sure of, you must get an interest in life.    1.7269387314284994
You've got to do something.   Many of you will say, "Well,    1.6065767145351917
what can I do"?   Believe me! There are many, many things    1.6065767145351917
to do. Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.    1.748515906000203
If you can't think of a thing to do, try something- anything.    1.6432600607208703
Maybe you will surprise yourself.   True! We are not all great    1.6065767145351917
artists. I, frankly, can't draw a straight line. Maybe you are    1.6065767145351917
not that gifted either, but how about puttering around with the old paints?    1.67495327387791
You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it. Anyway,    1.6432600607208703
I'll bet you have a lot of fun.   Do you like to sew? Does    1.7026049541338664
making your own clothes or even doll clothes, interest you? Do    1.6065767145351917
you love to run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes? If    1.7026049541338664
you do, go to it. There is always a market for this line of work. Some    1.748515906000203
women can sit and sew, crochet, tat or knit by the hour, and look    1.7026049541338664
calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work. Where sewing is concerned,    1.6432600607208703
I'm a total loss. When you see a needle in my hands you will    1.7026049541338664
know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on,    1.7269387314284994
or get out the safety pins.   Then again, there's always that    1.6065767145351917
lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs. Not for me, but perhaps    1.67495327387791
just the thing for you.   {Well! How's about mosaic    1.5127085093302464
tile, ceramics or similar arts and crafts?} Some people love to    1.6065767145351917
crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with    1.6432600607208703
as a result of their cracking good time.   How about the art of    1.67495327387791
cooking? Do you yearn to make cakes and pies, or special cookies    1.6432600607208703
and candies? There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy,    1.67495327387791
in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets    1.5636360329510388
to the contrary.   Some people can carve most anything out    1.5636360329510388
of a piece of wood. Some make beautiful chairs, cabinets, chests, doll    1.6432600607208703
houses, etc&.    1.0
Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried    1.5636360329510388
to see what you could do with a hunk of wood? Outside of cutting your    1.7269387314284994
fingers, maybe you would come up with nothing at all, but then again,    1.67495327387791
you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.   Some women get    1.6065767145351917
a real thrill out of housework. They love to dust, scrub, polish,    1.6432600607208703
wax floors, move the furniture around from place to place, take down the    1.67495327387791
curtains, put up new ones and have themselves a real ball. Maybe that's    1.67495327387791
your forte. It certainly isn't mine. I can look at furniture    1.6065767145351917
in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's    1.7026049541338664
{Perhaps you would like to become a writer.}    1.4513752902486308
This gives you a wide and varied choice. Will it be short stories,    1.67495327387791
fiction, nonfiction, biography, poetry, children's stories, or even    1.4513752902486308
a book if you are really ambitious?   Ever since I was a    1.6432600607208703
child, I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing. If you do    1.748515906000203
decide to write, you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips    1.6065767145351917
and dejection. Don't be discouraged! This is just being a normal    1.6065767145351917
writer. Just let the rejection slips fall where they may, and keep    1.6432600607208703
on plugging, and finally you will make the grade. Few new writers have    1.67495327387791
their first story accepted, so they tell me. But, it could happen,    1.6432600607208703
and it may happen to you.   Then there's always hobbies, collecting    1.6065767145351917
stamps, coins, timetables, salt and pepper shakers, elephants,    1.4513752902486308
dogs, dolls, shells, or shall we just say collecting anything your heart    1.6432600607208703
desires?   I can hear some of you folks protesting. You say,    1.6065767145351917
"But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby. I haven't got that    1.7269387314284994
kind of money".   True! It does cost a lot of money for    1.6432600607208703
most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free. How about a rock    1.7026049541338664
collection, or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs    1.6065767145351917
and in different colors? Then, take flowers. They are many and varied.    1.6432600607208703
Also, there's scrap books, collecting newspaper pictures and    1.4513752902486308
clippings, or any items of interest to you. It's getting interested    1.6065767145351917
{As for me, I am holding in reserve    1.4513752902486308
two huge puzzles (I love puzzles)} to put together when time hangs    1.6432600607208703
heavy on my hands. So far, the covers have never been off the    1.67495327387791
boxes. I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now.   1.748515906000203
So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise you to make    1.6065767145351917
the most of each day, enjoy each one to the ~n'th degree. Travel,    1.67495327387791
if you can. Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life    1.7026049541338664
and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to    1.7026049541338664
be sunshine sweet.   Good Luck! To one and all- Good Days    1.6065767145351917
ahead!    1.0
{A}n important criterion of maturity is creativity. The mature    1.5127085093302464
person    1.0
is creative. What does it mean to be creative, a term we hear with increasing    1.7269387314284994
frequency these days? When we turn to Noah Webster we find    1.6065767145351917
him helpful as usual. "To be creative is to have the ability to    1.67495327387791
cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth    1.6432600607208703
an original production of human intelligence or power". We are creative,    1.6065767145351917
it seems, when we produce something which has not previously existed.    1.6065767145351917
Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake, building    1.6432600607208703
a chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business, creating    1.6432600607208703
a League of Nations or, developing a mature character.   All    1.5636360329510388
living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence    1.6432600607208703
the power of creativity, if it is only to reproduce a form like their    1.7026049541338664
own. While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors    1.6065767145351917
in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal with a true    1.6432600607208703
non-instinctive and conscious creative ability. An animal, bird or    1.5127085093302464
insect creates either a burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness    1.6432600607208703
according to specie. Man's great superiority over these evolutionary    1.5127085093302464
forbears is in the development of his imagination. This gives him the    1.6432600607208703
power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories, ideas    1.67495327387791
and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment    1.6432600607208703
{I}t has been    1.0
truly said    1.0
that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting    1.6432600607208703
this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world. In our    1.6432600607208703
own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne    1.67495327387791
come into actuality. The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a    1.6432600607208703
poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of    1.7026049541338664
1941. In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's    1.67495327387791
projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more. It    1.6432600607208703
is in this one aspect, at least, that man seems to be made in the image    1.748515906000203
of his Creator.   Not only can man project his imagination    1.5636360329510388
out into his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly,    1.6065767145351917
he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself.    1.7026049541338664
We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training    1.6065767145351917
can become athletes, acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing    1.5127085093302464
many potentialities. We know that actors can learn to portray    1.5636360329510388
a wide variety of character roles. By this same combination of the    1.6432600607208703
will and the imagination, each one of us can learn to portray permanently    1.67495327387791
the kind of character we would like to be. We must realize with    1.67495327387791
Prof& Charles Morris in his THE OPEN SELF that "Man is the    1.6432600607208703
being that can continually remake himself, the artisan that is himself    1.6065767145351917
{S}o far in    1.0
history man    1.0
has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment    1.6065767145351917
rather than first creating the sort of person who can make    1.6065767145351917
the highest use of the things he has created. Is not the present world    1.7026049541338664
crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us    1.67495327387791
and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall    1.5636360329510388
the tragedy. Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend    1.67495327387791
our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our    1.67495327387791
own maturing process?   Sir Julian Huxley in his book UNIQUENESS    1.5636360329510388
OF MAN makes the novel point that just as man is unique in    1.67495327387791
being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood    1.67495327387791
under family protection, so is he the only animal who has a long    1.67495327387791
period after the decline of his procreativity.   1.3761581156320553
SOME recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples    1.5127085093302464
are a thing of the remote, Victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners    1.6432600607208703
are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough    1.5636360329510388
from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all    1.5636360329510388
the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.   Perhaps- but extensive    1.6065767145351917
discussions with contemporary practitioners, family doctors and    1.3761581156320553
gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance.    1.6065767145351917
Joking and talking may be freer and easier, but the important factual    1.6432600607208703
information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men    1.5636360329510388
and women.   Various factors in the setting can still be of great    1.6432600607208703
advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad    1.6432600607208703
memory for one or both. Privacy must be highly assured both in time and    1.7026049541338664
place. That is, locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of    1.6432600607208703
location, but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough    1.67495327387791
for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.   If the wedding party lasted    1.5636360329510388
late, and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before    1.67495327387791
resuming the trip or making an early start, the husband may forestall    1.6432600607208703
tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying    1.5636360329510388
in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours. The    1.67495327387791
consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long    1.67495327387791
First intercourse    1.0
for the bride brings with it the various problems connected    1.5636360329510388
with virginity and the hymen.   <One thing should be clear to    1.6065767145351917
both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur    1.6432600607208703
when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act. Ignorance on this    1.67495327387791
point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety, misunderstanding    1.5636360329510388
and suspicion>.   The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane    1.5636360329510388
that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most    1.67495327387791
female human beings who have not had sex relations. (Hymen, in fact,    1.6432600607208703
is the Greek word for membrane.)   Often it is thin and fragile    1.6432600607208703
and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.    1.7026049541338664
As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed very little    1.6065767145351917
and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.   1.6432600607208703
It is also important to realize that many girls are born without    1.6432600607208703
a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that <the absence    1.7269387314284994
of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex    1.7269387314284994
relations>.   But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations    1.6065767145351917
of the folk-lore beliefs. Some hymens are so strongly developed that    1.6065767145351917
they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked    1.6432600607208703
loss of blood. More rarely, the hymen is so sturdy that it does not    1.7026049541338664
yield to penetration.   Extreme cases are on record in which the    1.6065767145351917
doctor    1.0
has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital    1.67495327387791
relations to be consummated. These cases, for all their rarity, are    1.6065767145351917
so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general    1.6432600607208703
population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen    1.6432600607208703
is a serious problem to newly-weds.    1.2818970554302986
In recent times, when sexual    1.1606783668269585
matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly,    1.5636360329510388
the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention.    1.4513752902486308
Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new    1.6432600607208703
situation. Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of    1.67495327387791
making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?   1.6432600607208703
<Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride    1.5636360329510388
should consult a physician before marriage. If he foresaw any problem    1.6065767145351917
because of the quality of the hymen, it was recommended that simple    1.6432600607208703
procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably,    1.6065767145351917
to dilate it>.   As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was    1.6432600607208703
often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for    1.5636360329510388
painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.   This recommendation    1.4513752902486308
was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth    1.7269387314284994
consummation of the sex act. The vagina is an organ capable of    1.6432600607208703
remarkable contraction and dilation. This is obvious when it is remembered    1.6065767145351917
that, during childbirth, the vagina must dilate enough to permit    1.5636360329510388
the passage of the baby.   The intricate system of muscles that    1.6065767145351917
manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under    1.6065767145351917
voluntary control. But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious    1.6065767145351917
intention of the woman. That is, when first penetration takes    1.5636360329510388
place, the pressure and pain signals may <involuntarily> cause all the    1.6065767145351917
vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent    1.67495327387791
The advantages    1.0
of dilatation by the physician    1.1606783668269585
are both physical and psychological. Since it is a purely professional    1.6065767145351917
situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making or the    1.6065767145351917
beloved. By using instruments of gradually increasing size, the vagina    1.5636360329510388
is gently, and with minimum pain at each stage, taught to yield to    1.67495327387791
an object of the appropriate shape.   In this process the vaginal    1.6065767145351917
muscles come under better conscious control by the girl. She learns    1.6065767145351917
how to relax them to <accept>- instead of contracting them to <repel>    1.6432600607208703
the entering object.   Apart from the standard problem of    1.5127085093302464
controlling the vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that    1.5636360329510388
need special gynecological treatment. It is far better to have such    1.6065767145351917
conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon    1.67495327387791
where they can create a really serious situation.   When no    1.5636360329510388
medical problems exist, the newly married couple generally prefer to    1.5636360329510388
cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves. Special    1.6065767145351917
information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still    1.5127085093302464
of great value. Folk-lore, superstition and remembered passages from    1.5127085093302464
erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly    1.5636360329510388
<The importance    1.0
of loving tenderness is obvious. The long, unhurried approach and    1.5636360329510388
the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels. Under    1.5636360329510388
the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes    1.5636360329510388
and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases, providing an excellent    1.6065767145351917
lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration>.   Extensive    1.4513752902486308
observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established    1.4513752902486308
the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall    1.6065767145351917
(the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back) may cause    1.7269387314284994
a great deal of distress in a virgin. <But> during the same examination,    1.67495327387791
<two> fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall (the    1.5636360329510388
bottom of the vagina in the same position) without any pain; and in    1.67495327387791
fact without any difficulty <if the pressure is kept downward at all    1.6432600607208703
times>.   These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may    1.5127085093302464
be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse. The husband    1.5636360329510388
and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in    1.5636360329510388
mind. They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too    1.6432600607208703
much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at    1.67495327387791
least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer    1.6432600607208703
a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.   In    1.5636360329510388
fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely    1.5636360329510388
adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.   1.6065767145351917
Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing    1.6065767145351917
the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.    1.7026049541338664
The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain    1.6065767145351917
while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased    1.7026049541338664
with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling    1.5636360329510388
the problem once and for all.   <Such talk is seriously in error.    1.6432600607208703
Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride,    1.67495327387791
both physically and psychologically. The insistent, forceful penetration    1.4513752902486308
may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage    1.67495327387791
to the hymen>.   <The pain and distress associated with    1.5127085093302464
the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital    1.6432600607208703
relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the sex act unpleasant    1.6065767145351917
and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate    1.6065767145351917
Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in    1.6065767145351917
the honeymoon situation. The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's    1.6065767145351917
hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous    1.5636360329510388
desire. The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience    1.6432600607208703
a premature climax. This is a very common experience and should in    1.6432600607208703
no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.   Or the    1.6065767145351917
frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of    1.6432600607208703
the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him    1.67495327387791
to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period. The signals    1.6432600607208703
to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to    1.6432600607208703
take advantage of them.   The best course is to recover his physical    1.6432600607208703
excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again. This    1.6432600607208703
may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding    1.6432600607208703
and self-centered. He can take security from the fact that the    1.6065767145351917
progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.    1.6432600607208703
Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses from her, his bride    1.67495327387791
will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him    1.5127085093302464
restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they    1.6065767145351917
both so eagerly desire.   A final word. The accumulated information    1.5636360329510388
on this point shows that first intercourse, even when it is achieved    1.6432600607208703
with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom an overwhelming sexual    1.5636360329510388
experience to a woman. Too many new things are happening for it to    1.67495327387791
be a complete erotic fulfillment.   Only under rare circumstances    1.5127085093302464
would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse. Both    1.6065767145351917
man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax, and    1.7269387314284994
even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that    1.67495327387791
the wife may be cold or frigid.   If the early approaches are wise,    1.67495327387791
understanding and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment    1.4513752902486308
will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.   1.5636360329510388
WRITING in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures,    1.6432600607208703
titled <The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,> Kenneth    1.5127085093302464
Clark declares: "**h The human body, as a nucleus, is rich in associations.    1.67495327387791
**h It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things    1.6065767145351917
we wish to do with ourselves".   Perhaps this is a clue to    1.6432600607208703
the amazing variety and power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated    1.6065767145351917
by the nude form.   The wide divergence of reactions    1.5127085093302464
is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality.    1.5636360329510388
Differences were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds.    1.5127085093302464
Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt    1.6065767145351917
to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated beyond the eighth    1.6432600607208703
grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.   1.5127085093302464
Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating    1.5127085093302464
thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that    1.6065767145351917
her husband had "never seen her entirely naked", while another woman,    1.6065767145351917
boasting an equal number of years of married life, is proud of having    1.67495327387791
"shared the nudist way of life- the really free, natural nude    1.6065767145351917
life- for most of that period".   Attempts at censorship always    1.5636360329510388
involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions.    1.5127085093302464
The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude    1.4513752902486308
human form as "lewd    1.0
and pornographic, a threat and danger" to all the young, or good,    1.6432600607208703
or religious, or moral persons.   The equally ardent proponent    1.5127085093302464
of    1.0
freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the    1.67495327387791
"natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and the epitome    1.5636360329510388
of beauty and inspiration".   One is always a little surprised    1.5636360329510388
to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected. I    1.6065767145351917
still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic    1.67495327387791
advocate of the "clean, healthful, free way of natural life    1.5636360329510388
in nudism", who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution    1.5636360329510388
in fine spirit.   1.0
@ IN TRADITION and in poetry, the marriage bed is a place    1.6065767145351917
of unity and harmony. The partners each bring to it unselfish love,    1.6432600607208703
and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.   At its    1.67495327387791
most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly    1.6065767145351917
cares. Everything else is closed away.   This is the ideal.    1.5636360329510388
But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy    1.6065767145351917
are seldom achieved. Instead one partner or the other dominates the    1.6065767145351917
sexual relationship. In the past, it has been the husband who has been    1.67495327387791
dominant and the wife passive. But today there are signs that these    1.6432600607208703
roles are being reversed.   In a growing number of American homes,    1.6065767145351917
marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role    1.5636360329510388
in sexual relationships. It is she who decides the time, the place,    1.6432600607208703
the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act. It is she who    1.67495327387791
says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-    1.67495327387791
not the husband. The whole act is tailored to <her> pleasure,    1.6065767145351917
and not to <theirs>.   Beyond a certain point, of course,    1.5636360329510388
no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that. But there is little    1.7026049541338664
doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.   1.67495327387791
Of course, there remain many "old-fashioned" marriages in    1.4513752902486308
which the husband maintains his supremacy. Yet even in these marriages,    1.6065767145351917
psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly. The    1.5127085093302464
meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's    1.6432600607208703
or grandmother's standards.   To many experts, this trend was    1.5127085093302464
inevitable. They consider it simply a sign of our times. Our society    1.6432600607208703
has "emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence and new    1.5636360329510388
authority. It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual    1.6432600607208703
role.   "The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum",    1.5636360329510388
declares Dr& Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director of the    1.5127085093302464
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent    1.5636360329510388
book, <Release From Sexual Tensions>. "It reflects what is going    1.5636360329510388
on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself. A world    1.67495327387791
in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual    1.7026049541338664
relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too".   1.4513752902486308
Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination    1.5127085093302464
of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy    1.67495327387791
and even dangerous. It can, in fact, wreck a marriage.   When    1.6065767145351917
a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she    1.6432600607208703
is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her.    1.6065767145351917
And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.    1.6065767145351917
On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his self-respect,    1.6432600607208703
and robs him of his masculinity. He is a target of ridicule    1.6432600607208703
to his wife, and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-    1.6065767145351917
to the outside world as well.   "A marriage can survive almost    1.6065767145351917
any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's    1.67495327387791
maleness", declares Dr& Calderone. This opinion is supported    1.4513752902486308
by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, Dr& Maurice    1.5127085093302464
E& Linden, director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia    1.6065767145351917
Department of Public Health.   "When the roles of    1.4513752902486308
husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the    1.67495327387791
husband follower", Dr& Linden says, "the effects on their whole    1.5636360329510388
IN ONE EXTREME case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office    1.6065767145351917
worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband    1.5636360329510388
unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded. To win her favors, her    1.67495327387791
husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle    1.6065767145351917
from his employer. Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison. While    1.6432600607208703
he was in custody his wife divorced him.   More typical is    1.6065767145351917
the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage    1.6432600607208703
counselor. This woman repeatedly complained she was "too tired"    1.5127085093302464
for marital relations. To please her, her husband assumed some of the    1.6432600607208703
domestic chores. Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the    1.5636360329510388
children, and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations    1.6432600607208703
as often as he desired them.   One wife, described by a    1.6065767145351917
New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed    1.6065767145351917
their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between    1.6065767145351917
the weekly ~PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood    1.4513752902486308
card parties. Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis. After    1.5636360329510388
every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the    1.5636360329510388
matter was settled in her favor.   Experts say the partners in    1.6065767145351917
marriages like these can almost be typed.   The wife is likely    1.6065767145351917
to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed    1.7026049541338664
a promising career for marriage. She knows the power of the    1.6065767145351917
sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.   The husband    1.67495327387791
is usually a well-educated professional, preoccupied with his job-    1.5127085093302464
often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: "Don't    1.6065767145351917
rock the boat".   Sometimes this leads to his becoming    1.5127085093302464
demandingly dominant in marriage. Hemmed in on the job and unable to    1.6432600607208703
assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one    1.748515906000203
area.   More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting    1.5636360329510388
to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule    1.7026049541338664
at home.   Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound    1.5127085093302464
husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their    1.6065767145351917
wives. The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend,    1.5127085093302464
is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay    1.6432600607208703
as much attention to her as he does to his job.   Naturally no    1.67495327387791
woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative. Unless her    1.5636360329510388
husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated. Generally,    1.5636360329510388
however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's    1.67495327387791
mercy.   "The pattern", says Dr& Morton    1.2818970554302986
Schillinger,    1.0
psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy,    1.4513752902486308
"is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually    1.6065767145351917
trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight    1.67495327387791
is the night".   No one seriously contends, of course, that    1.5636360329510388
the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world.    1.6432600607208703
After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic    1.6432600607208703
figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as Dr& Schillinger    1.67495327387791
points out. There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts    1.5127085093302464
became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master    1.6065767145351917
FURTHERMORE, Dr& Calderone says, a certain    1.2818970554302986
number of docile, retiring men always have been around. They aren't    1.6065767145351917
"frigid" and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained    1.4513752902486308
in all of life. They <like> to be dominated. One such man once    1.67495327387791
confided to Dr& Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he    1.5636360329510388
preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor. Asked why, he replied    1.6432600607208703
primly: "Because that's no activity for a gentleman".   1.4513752902486308
But such cases were, in the past, unusual. Society here and abroad    1.6432600607208703
has been built around the dominating male- even the Bible appears    1.6065767145351917
to endorse the concept.   Family survival on our own Western frontier,    1.6065767145351917
for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength    1.5636360329510388
and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom    1.6432600607208703
questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed.   1.5127085093302464
This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early    1.6065767145351917
20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring    1.6432600607208703
<Life With Father> manner.   In those days, a wife had mighty    1.6065767145351917
few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.    1.67495327387791
"Grandma wasn't expected to like it", Dr& Marion Hilliard,    1.5127085093302464
the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the    1.6065767145351917
'90s. Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as    1.5636360329510388
"used" by their husbands- and, history indicates, they often quite    1.5636360329510388
literally were.   When was the turning point? When did women    1.5636360329510388
SOME DATE IT from    1.0
woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men    1.6065767145351917
in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper    1.6432600607208703
and bathtub gin. Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend    1.5636360329510388
toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with    1.4513752902486308
the postwar rush to the suburbs.   Left alone while her husband    1.6065767145351917
was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties    1.7026049541338664
normally reserved for the male. Circumstances gave her almost undisputed    1.5636360329510388
sway over child-rearing, money-handling and home maintenance.    1.3761581156320553
She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was    1.7026049541338664
once considered too helpless. She liked this taste of authority and    1.6065767145351917
independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.   1.6065767145351917
"Very few wives", says Dr& Calderone, "who balance the checkbook,    1.5636360329510388
fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with    1.6432600607208703
the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.    1.6432600607208703
A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the    1.5636360329510388
sexual relationship as well".   And an additional factor was    1.5127085093302464
helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively    1.5127085093302464
recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.    1.6065767145351917
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the    1.5636360329510388
importance of the female climax. They began to describe in detail the    1.6432600607208703
woman's capacity for response.   In fact, the noted psychologist    1.5127085093302464
and sex researcher, Dr& Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that    1.5636360329510388
women are "sexually superior" to men. According to Dr& Ellis,    1.5636360329510388
the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual    1.6065767145351917
arousal than her partner. Not surprisingly, Dr& Ellis says,    1.5127085093302464
some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.   1.5636360329510388
Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr& Maurice Linden, many    1.4513752902486308
wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them. An aggressive    1.6432600607208703
woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under. "When the husband    1.6432600607208703
becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", Dr&    1.5636360329510388
Linden says, "the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. Often she    1.6065767145351917
fails to gain sexual satisfaction".   One such wife, Dr&    1.5127085093302464
Linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through    1.6065767145351917
a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger    1.6432600607208703
man. But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until    1.6432600607208703
that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity. Then the    1.6432600607208703
wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.   In some cases, however,    1.6432600607208703
domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered    1.6432600607208703
by a passing but urgent emotional need. Thus a man who is butting    1.67495327387791
a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed-    1.6432600607208703
the one place he can still be champion. If his on-the-job problems work    1.67495327387791
out, he may return to his old pattern. Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness    1.67495327387791
will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels    1.67495327387791
age creeping up.   On the other hand, a husband who always has    1.6432600607208703
been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking,    1.5127085093302464
psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.    1.6065767145351917
Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered    1.6432600607208703
or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.   In any case,    1.6432600607208703
Dr& Calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair,    1.5636360329510388
and can't always be measured by a general yardstick. "As long    1.6065767145351917
as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little    1.7026049541338664
difference if one or the other dominates", Dr& Calderone declares.    1.5636360329510388
"The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment".   1.6065767145351917
Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination    1.4513752902486308
by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period,    1.67495327387791
it is likely to shake the marriage. And just as domination today often    1.67495327387791
begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.   1.67495327387791
"To get a marriage back where it belongs", comments Dr&    1.5636360329510388
Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, "the husband must take    1.5127085093302464
some very basic steps. He must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more    1.6065767145351917
selfish. He must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding    1.6432600607208703
and less 'understanding'".   Too many husbands, Dr&    1.3761581156320553
Schillinger continues, worry about "how well they're doing",    1.4513752902486308
and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual    1.67495327387791
play.    1.0
SHE GAVE HERSELF a title **h Lady Diana Harrington.   1.5127085093302464
The New York D&A& gave her another **h the Golden Girl    1.6065767145351917
of cafe society.   Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant,    1.6065767145351917
title **h prostitute.   And Houston police have the final    1.5127085093302464
say in the matter since she died there on September 20, 1960, "Diane    1.67495327387791
Harris Graham, 30, D&O&A& circumstances- unusual".   1.2818970554302986
Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men,    1.6432600607208703
there was money, and with the two came luxury and liquor. She was still    1.7026049541338664
in the play for pay business when she died, a top trollop who had    1.7026049541338664
given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.   1.6432600607208703
She never hid the fact that she liked to play. Her neighbors    1.6432600607208703
in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that    1.5127085093302464
the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as    1.6065767145351917
"the Golden    1.0
Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial".   It was the trial of    1.6065767145351917
oleomargarine heir Minot (Mickey) Jelke for compulsory prostitution    1.4513752902486308
in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.    1.6065767145351917
(Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding    1.6432600607208703
a ring of high-priced call girls.)   Diane was needed as a material    1.6432600607208703
witness in the case and New York police searched three continents    1.6065767145351917
before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel,    1.67495327387791
of course. She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington,    1.67495327387791
a name that made some of the gossip columns.   It was when    1.6432600607208703
she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation    1.6432600607208703
she liked best.   Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant    1.6432600607208703
District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning    1.5127085093302464
judge:   "This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.   1.5636360329510388
"In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County. In    1.6065767145351917
the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign    1.67495327387791
tycoon who took her to France, where she later met a very wealthy man    1.7026049541338664
and toured all Europe with him.   "At Deauville she met an    1.6065767145351917
Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey. He was the official procurer for    1.67495327387791
King Farouk, now in exile. She was in Egypt during the revolution    1.6432600607208703
and had passport difficulty. She lied in order to get it.   "We    1.6432600607208703
have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally    1.6432600607208703
back into this country **h She has been acting as a prostitute.   1.6432600607208703
"Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts    1.6065767145351917
to Jelke".   Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.    1.5127085093302464
"That's a lie. I never gave that boy a cent. I am not a prostitute,    1.7269387314284994
and I had only one very wealthy boy friend", she said.    1.6065767145351917
During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up part of that statement.   1.67495327387791
"Diane is the type of girl", Jelke said, "who wouldn't    1.5636360329510388
get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up    1.6065767145351917
all your money in the middle of the floor".   But she seemed to    1.67495327387791
have underestimated the number of her "boy friends".   She    1.5127085093302464
came to New York from Detroit as a teenager, but with a "sponsor"    1.67495327387791
instead of a chaperone. As she told it, "He's a rich boy friend,    1.67495327387791
an old guy about 60". She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed,    1.6432600607208703
but not naive. She had talked her "boy friend" into sending her    1.6432600607208703
to New York to take a screen test.   1.4513752902486308
The screen test was never made- but Diane was. She quickly    1.6065767145351917
moved into cafe society, possibly easing her conscience by talking    1.5636360329510388
constantly of her desire to be in show business.   She seemed    1.6065767145351917
so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail    1.7269387314284994
circuit set up a practical joke.   An ex-fighter was introduced    1.5636360329510388
to her in a bar as "Mr& Warfield, the famous producer". The    1.6432600607208703
phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.   1.7269387314284994
"I'd love to audition for you", she gushed.   The    1.5127085093302464
audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment. She    1.6065767145351917
thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show    1.6432600607208703
the eminent producer how well she could dance.   After a few minutes    1.6432600607208703
he said, "I can't use you if you dance like that. I'd like    1.67495327387791
to see you dance nude".   She hastily complied. Diane loved    1.5636360329510388
to dance in the nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.   1.67495327387791
She developed another quaint habit. Even among the fast set    1.5636360329510388
in which she was moving, her method for keeping an escort from departing    1.67495327387791
too early was unique.   When the date would try to bid her    1.6432600607208703
good-night at the door, she would tell him, "If you go home now, I'll    1.7026049541338664
scream". More often than not he would bow to the inevitable.   1.6065767145351917
One who needed no such threats was a French financier. One of    1.6432600607208703
the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel. She wanted    1.6065767145351917
to go around the world, but she settled for a French holiday.   1.6432600607208703
In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told    1.6065767145351917
of spending several months with her. "Then she went to Deauville    1.6065767145351917
where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers".   1.6432600607208703
The Greek evidently fell for her, "Monsieur ~X" recounted,    1.5127085093302464
and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he    1.67495327387791
gave her 100,000 francs (about $300) and led her to the roulette tables.   1.67495327387791
She could do no wrong at the tables that time. And in short    1.67495327387791
order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way. Smarter    1.6065767145351917
than most gamblers, she slipped away from the casino, packed her bag    1.6432600607208703
and took the night train to Paris. No one ever learned what happened    1.67495327387791
to the Greek.   The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel,    1.5636360329510388
the George /5,, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so she high-tailed    1.5636360329510388
it to Rome.   She teamed up with another beauty, whose    1.5636360329510388
name has been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling that    1.6432600607208703
would have made Nero envious.   To climax her Roman revels, she    1.6065767145351917
was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked    1.67495327387791
through its marble halls screaming for help.   It was a rugged    1.6065767145351917
finish for what must have been a very interesting night.   Discreet    1.6065767145351917
Italian police described it in a manner typically continental.   1.5127085093302464
"There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom:    1.6432600607208703
Miss Harrington (this was Diane's choice for a Roman name),    1.5636360329510388
another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and    1.6065767145351917
one of your well-known American actors.   "The actor had had    1.5636360329510388
much to drink and apparently became very violent. The hotel staff,    1.6065767145351917
as well as residents of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies    1.7026049541338664
were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.   1.6432600607208703
"They were wearing nothing but their scratches. They were    1.5127085093302464
asked to leave the hotel. No charges were filed".   The girls,    1.6065767145351917
after dressing, were indignant.   "You can't do this to    1.5127085093302464
us", Diane screamed. "We are Americans".   In the morning    1.5127085093302464
she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally    1.6065767145351917
luxurious Hotel Ambassador.   With the Ambassador as headquarters,    1.4513752902486308
she continued to promote good will abroad. Of course, her benevolence    1.6065767145351917
was limited to those who could afford it, but then there is a    1.67495327387791
limit to what one person can do.   By this time Diane was a beguiling    1.7026049541338664
lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world. She thought    1.67495327387791
royal status might come her way when, while she was still in Rome,    1.67495327387791
she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt.   1.6432600607208703
A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this    1.6432600607208703
way:   "It was a strange relationship. Pulley Bey spoke no    1.5636360329510388
English. Diane spoke no Italian or French. She had a hard time    1.6432600607208703
making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.   "Pulley    1.6432600607208703
Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him", the friend    1.6065767145351917
continued. It seemed as though she were always auditioning.    1.5127085093302464
No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors, the plump    1.6065767145351917
Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she    1.6432600607208703
waited for nine months, vainly hoping to see Farouk.   Pulley    1.5636360329510388
had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but she grew impatient waiting    1.67495327387791
for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the    1.67495327387791
royal pimp had no key.   She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends    1.6065767145351917
from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her. Tewfik    1.6065767145351917
Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of    1.5127085093302464
Cairo society enjoyed her company.   "So extensive became her    1.5127085093302464
circle of admirers", Egyptian police said, "that her escapades    1.5127085093302464
caused distrust".   The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's    1.6432600607208703
little world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution    1.6065767145351917
to bring it down. When Farouk was overthrown, police picked up    1.6065767145351917
his personal pimp, Pulley Bey. They also called upon Diane with    1.6065767145351917
a request for a look at her passport.   The cagey Pulley Bey,    1.6432600607208703
who spoke no English, had taken the passport so that Diane    1.6065767145351917
couldn't    1.0
leave the country without his approval. Officials provided a temporary    1.5636360329510388
passport, good only for return to the United States.   And    1.5636360329510388
return to the United States she did, into waiting arms- the unromantic    1.6432600607208703
ones of the New York District Attorney's office.   Held    1.5127085093302464
as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey    1.6065767145351917
Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed    1.6432600607208703
to the Women's House of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.   1.5636360329510388
It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk    1.67495327387791
the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a    1.6432600607208703
hotel room, with her meals taken at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian    1.6065767145351917
restaurant.   Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated    1.5636360329510388
that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.   With    1.5127085093302464
the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York **h it was    1.67495327387791
no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous "Lady Harrington".   1.5636360329510388
Several years ago she married a Houston business man, Robert    1.5636360329510388
Graham. She later divorced Graham, who is believed to have moved    1.6065767145351917
to Bolivia.   Houston police got to know Diane two years ago    1.6065767145351917
when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring.    1.7026049541338664
Last May, they said, she admitted being a prostitute.   The    1.5636360329510388
next time the police saw her she was dead.   It was September    1.6432600607208703
20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles.    1.6065767145351917
She had had a party with a regular visitor, Dr& William W&    1.6432600607208703
McClellan.   McClellan, who had once lost his medical license    1.5127085093302464
temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with her when she died.    1.67495327387791
He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had    1.7026049541338664
happened during that time. When he realized she was dead, he called    1.6432600607208703
two lawyers and then the police.   When the police arrived, they    1.6065767145351917
found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.   1.5636360329510388
The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet and a pink    1.67495327387791
blanket covered her. Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the    1.67495327387791
walls.   An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's    1.6065767145351917
body. Police theorize that a combination of dope, drink and    1.5636360329510388
drugs killed her.   "I think that maybe she wanted it this way",    1.6432600607208703
a vice squad cop said. "A maid told us that she still bragged    1.67495327387791
about getting $50 a date. She was on the junk, and they slide fast when    1.7269387314284994
that happens. At least she never knew what the bottom was    1.6065767145351917
like".    1.0
I AM a carpet salesman.   I work for one of the biggest chains    1.67495327387791
of retail carpet houses in the East. We cater mostly to nice people    1.67495327387791
in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy,    1.67495327387791
neon-lit, chromium-plated suburban stores.   I am selling the    1.4513752902486308
stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams- <wall-to-wall    1.6432600607208703
carpeting>.   There is only one trouble with this big,    1.5127085093302464
beautiful dream. From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.   1.6432600607208703
People come to me with confidence. They depend on my supposedly    1.6065767145351917
expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.   1.6065767145351917
But I knowingly abuse their confidence.    1.2818970554302986
FRANKLIN D& Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs&    1.6065767145351917
Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited him in Bakersfield,    1.5636360329510388
California, several months ago as a prospective patient. "Doctor"    1.5127085093302464
Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then,    1.7026049541338664
by squeezing her foot three times, he came up- presto- with a    1.6432600607208703
different diagnosis with each squeeze. She had- he informed her-    1.5636360329510388
kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female disorder. (He explained    1.6065767145351917
that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because    1.6065767145351917
all of the nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the    1.67495327387791
thing for her- a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone generator"    1.6065767145351917
machine.   As he applied the applicator extending from the    1.5127085093302464
machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed    1.5636360329510388
on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions    1.5127085093302464
of Mrs& Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific    1.6432600607208703
mumbo-jumbo. Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically    1.5636360329510388
everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked, why the    1.6065767145351917
colors of the tubes were important to people's health? The human    1.6065767145351917
body- he pointed out, for example- required 33 units of blue light.    1.6432600607208703
For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing    1.67495327387791
glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:   "Don't    1.5636360329510388
you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body".   1.5127085093302464
"Cancer"! Mrs& Shaefer practically shrieked. "You    1.2818970554302986
didn't tell me I had cancer".   "You have it, all right.    1.6065767145351917
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing    1.7026049541338664
to worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with    1.7026049541338664
97 pounds of cancer in her body".   He urged her to buy one    1.67495327387791
of his machines- for $300. When she said that she didn't have the    1.67495327387791
money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office    1.67495327387791
model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold her minerals to cure    1.7269387314284994
her kidney ailment, a can of sage "to make her look like a girl again",    1.7269387314284994
and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.   1.6065767145351917
Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs& Shaefer to buy his machine    1.6065767145351917
when she visited him the next day. After another treatment with the machine,    1.67495327387791
he told her that "her entire body was shot through with tumors    1.6432600607208703
and cysts". He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would    1.6432600607208703
take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money    1.67495327387791
for buying his machine.   When she submitted to his treatment with    1.6065767145351917
the capsules, Mrs& Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's    1.5127085093302464
office, Mrs& Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated    1.6065767145351917
her for burned tissue. For several days, she was ill as a result    1.67495327387791
of Lee's treatment.   Mrs& Shaefer never got around to    1.5127085093302464
joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone    1.7026049541338664
machines. For Mrs& Shaefer- who had been given a clean bill    1.6065767145351917
of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee- and her    1.7026049541338664
friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection    1.6065767145351917
Bureau. And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the    1.6065767145351917
evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder    1.5636360329510388
under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court for convicting    1.5636360329510388
Franklin D& Lee. The charge: violation of the California Medical    1.5636360329510388
Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling    1.5636360329510388
misbranded drugs. The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the    1.5127085093302464
county jail.   An isolated case of quackery? By no means. Rather,    1.6065767145351917
it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic    1.6432600607208703
devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands    1.6065767145351917
of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them    1.6432600607208703
away from legitimate, ethical medical treatment of serious diseases.    1.5127085093302464
The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and    1.6432600607208703
ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.   With these gadgets-    1.5636360329510388
impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs, ticks,    1.6065767145351917
and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing    1.6432600607208703
on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of    1.5636360329510388
our scientific age. He milks the latest scientific advances, translating    1.5636360329510388
them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his    1.6065767145351917
fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual    1.6432600607208703
impotence and cancer.   The gadget faker operates or sells his    1.5636360329510388
phony machines for $5 to $10,000-    1.2818970554302986
anything the traffic will bear. He    1.2818970554302986
may call himself a naprapath, a physiotherapist, an electrotherapist,    1.5127085093302464
a naturopath, a sanipractor, a medical cultist, a masseur, a "doctor"-    1.6065767145351917
or what have you. Not only do these quacks assume impressive    1.6065767145351917
titles, but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific    1.5636360329510388
or impressive foundations-    1.0
foundations which often have little    1.1606783668269585
more than a letterhead existence.   The medical device pirate    1.5127085093302464
of today, of course, is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor    1.67495327387791
of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and    1.5127085093302464
other patent medicines. His plunder is therefore far higher- running    1.5636360329510388
into hundreds of millions.   According to the Food and Drug    1.5636360329510388
Administration (~FDA), "Doctor" Ghadiali, Dr& Albert    1.2818970554302986
Abrams and his clique, and Dr& Wilhelm Reich- to name three notorious    1.6432600607208703
device quacks- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000,    1.3761581156320553
5000, and 2000 fake health machines.   Authorities believe    1.4513752902486308
that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are    1.6432600607208703
still in business. Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims    1.67495327387791
in Cleveland. Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid $1020 to    1.6065767145351917
a masseur, and Mr& A&, a laborer, paid $4200 to a chiropractor for    1.67495327387791
treatment with two fake health machines- the "radioclast" and    1.5127085093302464
the "diagnometer". Multiply these figures by the millions of people    1.5636360329510388
known to be conned by medical pirates annually. You will come up    1.6432600607208703
with a frightening total.   That's why the ~FDA, the American    1.5636360329510388
Medical Association (~AMA), and the National Better Business    1.4513752902486308
Bureau (~BBB) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery    1.5127085093302464
to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical    1.7026049541338664
charlatans annually.   The Postmaster General recently reported    1.3761581156320553
that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices    1.5127085093302464
figure prominently- are at the highest level in history. Similarly,    1.5636360329510388
the American Cancer Society (~ACS), the Arthritis and Rheumatism    1.5127085093302464
Foundation, and the ~BBB have each stated lately that medical    1.5636360329510388
quackery is at a new high. For example, the ~BBB has reported    1.6432600607208703
it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and    1.6432600607208703
10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.   Authorities    1.6065767145351917
hesitate to quote exact figures, however, believing that any    1.5127085093302464
sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by    1.67495327387791
their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical    1.6065767145351917
racketeer. In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates of phony    1.6065767145351917
device quackery are conservative.   The economic toll that    1.4513752902486308
the device quack extracts is important, of course. But it is our health-    1.67495327387791
more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern    1.6432600607208703
witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away.    1.5636360329510388
By preying on the sick, by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate,    1.7026049541338664
by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical    1.6065767145351917
ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.   Typically,    1.5636360329510388
Sarah Gross and Mr& ~A both lost more than their money    1.6065767145351917
as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks. Sarah    1.6065767145351917
Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment    1.6065767145351917
by the masseur were not helping her. As a result, she consulted medical    1.67495327387791
authorities and learned that the devices her quack "doctor" was    1.5636360329510388
using were phony. She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be    1.6432600607208703
institutionalized.   1.0
Mr& A&, her fellow townsman, also experienced    1.3761581156320553
a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been    1.67495327387791
bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been    1.6432600607208703
treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease, multiple    1.6065767145351917
sclerosis- and himself. Mr& ~A has recovered, but he is,    1.5636360329510388
justifiably, a bitter man. "That's a lot of hard-earned money to    1.6065767145351917
lose", he says today. "Neither me nor my wife were helped by that    1.67495327387791
chiropractor's treatments".   And there was the case of Tom    1.5127085093302464
Hepker, a machinist, who was referred by a friend to a health machine    1.67495327387791
quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what    1.6065767145351917
Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine. After    1.6432600607208703
his pains got worse, Tom decided to see a real doctor, from whom he    1.7026049541338664
learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung. Yes, Tom caught    1.6432600607208703
it in time to stay alive. But he's a welfare case now- a human wreck-    1.7269387314284994
thanks to this modern witch doctor.   But the machine quack    1.5636360329510388
can cause far more than just suffering. In such diseases as cancer,    1.6432600607208703
tuberculosis, and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are so    1.5636360329510388
vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's    1.6432600607208703
cure-all gadget can prove fatal. Moreover, the diabetic patient who relies    1.6065767145351917
on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake    1.67495327387791
can be committing suicide. For instance:   In Chicago,    1.4513752902486308
some time ago, Mr& H&, age 27, a diabetic since he was six, stopped    1.7026049541338664
using    1.0
insulin because he had bought a "magic spike"- a glass tube    1.6065767145351917
about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small    1.67495327387791
fraction of a cent- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306    1.67495327387791
as a cure-all. "Hang this around your neck or attach it to other    1.67495327387791
parts of your anatomy, and its rays will cure any disease you have",    1.67495327387791
said the company. Mr& H& is dead today because he followed this    1.6432600607208703
advice.   Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken    1.4513752902486308
by her husband to see Otis G& Carroll, a sanipractor- a licensed    1.6432600607208703
drugless healer- in Spokane. Carroll diagnosed Mrs& Hull by    1.5127085093302464
taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his "radionic"    1.7026049541338664
machine and twirling some knobs (fee $50).   His prescription:    1.5127085093302464
hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water. Although    1.6065767145351917
she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted    1.6065767145351917
her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water.    1.7026049541338664
Inevitably, Mrs& Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis, weighing    1.5127085093302464
60 pounds. Moreover, her husband and child contracted T&B&    1.5127085093302464
from her. (Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823    1.6065767145351917
for his wife's death.)   In California, a few years ago, a ghoul    1.6432600607208703
by the name of H& F& Bell sold electric blankets as a cure    1.67495327387791
for cancer. He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric    1.7026049541338664
blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died,    1.6432600607208703
reconditioning them, and selling them at $185 each. When authorities    1.5636360329510388
convicted him of practicing medicine without a license (he got off with    1.6432600607208703
a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of    1.6432600607208703
77), one of his victims was not around to testify: He was dead of    1.7026049541338664
cancer.   By no means are these isolated cases. "Unfortunately",    1.5127085093302464
says Chief Postal Inspector David H& Stephens, who has prosecuted    1.5636360329510388
many device quacks, "the ghouls who trade on the hopes of    1.6065767145351917
the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the    1.5636360329510388
patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up    1.67495327387791
DEATH! Have no doubt about it. That's    1.3761581156320553
where device quackery can lead. The evidence shows that fake therapeutic    1.6065767145351917
machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have hastened the    1.5127085093302464
deaths of thousands.   Who are the victims of the device quacks?    1.6065767145351917
Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target. Says Wallace    1.5636360329510388
F& Jannsen, director of the ~FDA's Division of Public Information:    1.5636360329510388
"Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older    1.5636360329510388
people, or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism,    1.6065767145351917
diabetes, and cancer. People who have not been able to get    1.6065767145351917
relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in    1.6432600607208703
by quacks". The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people, like    1.6432600607208703
Mr& A&, who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice    1.67495327387791
to Doctor Fraud's avarice. They are often ignorant as well as    1.6065767145351917
underprivileged.   1.0
TEN-YEAR-OLD Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome    1.4513752902486308
for almost a year. His grades had gone steadily downhill, and    1.6065767145351917
he had stopped bringing    1.0
friends and classmates home from school.   1.2818970554302986
Mr& and Mrs& Stewart were puzzled and concerned. Then one day    1.6065767145351917
Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door, let the cat out of the    1.6432600607208703
bag. The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick "Bugs    1.6065767145351917
Bunny" because his teeth protruded.   When Richard's parents    1.4513752902486308
told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who    1.67495327387791
specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested.    1.6065767145351917
During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly    1.4513752902486308
with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved-    1.6065767145351917
an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his    1.6065767145351917
facial appearance.   Richard Stewart is no special case. "The    1.5127085093302464
majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form    1.6432600607208703
of orthodontic treatment", says Dr& Allan G& Brodie, professor    1.5127085093302464
and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of    1.6065767145351917
Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field.    1.5127085093302464
What do parents need to know about those "years of the braces" in    1.67495327387791
order not to waste a child's time and their money? How can they    1.67495327387791
tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment? Why and when should    1.6065767145351917
tooth-straightening be undertaken? What is it likely to cost?    1.5127085093302464
OCCLUSION is the dentist's expression    1.1606783668269585
for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion,    1.6432600607208703
or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for. One main type    1.7269387314284994
of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper    1.6065767145351917
front teeth. A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the    1.67495327387791
face, a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped lower    1.6432600607208703
jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type    1.5636360329510388
of malocclusion.   These two basic malformations have, of course,    1.5127085093302464
many variations. A child probably requires some form of treatment    1.5636360329510388
if he has any of the following conditions: _@_ A noticeable    1.5636360329510388
protrusion of the upper or lower jaw. _@_ Crooked, overlapping,    1.5127085093302464
twisted, or widely spaced teeth. _@_ Front teeth not meeting    1.5127085093302464
when the back teeth close. _@_ Upper teeth completely covering    1.5127085093302464
the lowers when the back teeth close. _@_ The eyeteeth (third from    1.6065767145351917
the middle on top, counting each front tooth as the first) beginning    1.6432600607208703
to protrude like fangs. _@_ Second teeth that have come in before    1.6065767145351917
the first ones have fallen out, making a double row.   Contrary    1.6065767145351917
to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago, when all malocclusion was    1.67495327387791
blamed on some unfortunate habit, recent studies show that most tooth    1.6065767145351917
irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.    1.5127085093302464
However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must    1.6432600607208703
necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.   Tooth deformity    1.5636360329510388
may be the result of <excessive> thumb- or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting,    1.5636360329510388
or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that    1.4513752902486308
there's a difference between <normal> and <excessive> sucking    1.4513752902486308
habits. It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and    1.6065767145351917
no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two    1.7026049541338664
or three years old. Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect    1.7026049541338664
a youngster's teeth; but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure    1.5127085093302464
is frequent, it will have an effect.   Malocclusion can also    1.5636360329510388
result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long. If a child    1.7269387314284994
loses a molar at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward    1.7026049541338664
the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent    1.6065767145351917
ones and producing a jumble. If baby teeth are retained too long, the    1.67495327387791
incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal    1.6065767145351917
time or may have to erupt in the wrong place.    1.5636360329510388
EVERY orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by    1.4513752902486308
their malformed teeth. Some such youngsters rarely smile, or they try    1.6065767145351917
to speak with the mouth closed. In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's,    1.67495327387791
a child's personality is affected. Yet from the dentist's    1.5127085093302464
point of view, bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.   1.6065767145351917
Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through    1.5636360329510388
a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots. This serious    1.6432600607208703
condition, popularly known as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes    1.6065767145351917
of tooth loss in adults.   Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together    1.5636360329510388
teeth are prone to trapping food particles, increasing the    1.5127085093302464
likelihood of rapid decay. "For these and other reasons", says Dr&    1.6065767145351917
Brodie, "orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth".   1.4513752902486308
The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal    1.6432600607208703
chewing, so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden    1.67495327387791
on his digestive system. Because of these chewing troubles, a child may    1.6432600607208703
avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition. Badly placed    1.5636360329510388
teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping.    1.5636360329510388
"MOST orthodontic work is done on children    1.3761581156320553
between the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients    1.6432600607208703
as young as two and as old as 55", says Dr& Brodie.   In    1.67495327387791
the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed,    1.7026049541338664
yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed    1.6065767145351917
teeth comparatively easy. Orthodontic work is possible because teeth    1.5127085093302464
are held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal membrane with    1.67495327387791
an involved nerve network, to the bone in the jaw; they are not    1.67495327387791
anchored directly to the bone. Abnormal pressure, applied over a period    1.6065767145351917
of time, produces a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions    1.67495327387791
normally in the new position into which it has been guided.   What    1.6432600607208703
can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's    1.5127085093302464
office? On her first visit the orthodontist will take ~X rays,    1.6065767145351917
photographs, tooth measurements, and "tooth prints"- an impression    1.4513752902486308
of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.    1.6432600607208703
If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for Susie an appliance    1.6432600607208703
consisting of bands, plastic plates, fine wires, and tiny springs. This    1.6065767145351917
appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure    1.5636360329510388
on the bone. As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure side    1.67495327387791
of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on the side from which the    1.7269387314284994
tooth has moved. This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue    1.7269387314284994
grows, and no faster.   "If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious    1.6065767145351917
injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding    1.67495327387791
bone holding them in place", explains Dr& Brodie. "Moving one    1.5636360329510388
or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an ill-conceived plan    1.6432600607208703
of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face".   1.6065767145351917
During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately    1.6065767145351917
following each adjustment, Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness,    1.6065767145351917
but after a short time this will disappear. Parents are often    1.6065767145351917
concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay. When    1.5636360329510388
in place, a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth    1.6432600607208703
that is covered.   Next Susie will enter the treatment stage    1.5636360329510388
and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on the severity    1.67495327387791
of her condition. During these visits the dentist will adjust    1.5636360329510388
the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.   Last comes the    1.6432600607208703
<retention> stage. Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable    1.6065767145351917
new position. But because teeth sometimes may drift back to    1.5636360329510388
their original position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them in    1.6432600607208703
place. Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and    1.7026049541338664
stretching across the teeth. Susie may wear this only at night or for    1.67495327387791
a few hours during the day.   Then comes the time when the last    1.67495327387791
wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive    1.6432600607208703
girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.   How long    1.6065767145351917
will this take? Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may    1.6432600607208703
take only a few months. Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more.    1.7269387314284994
An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three    1.67495327387791
years to correct.    1.0
THE charge for a    1.0
complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country. Work    1.6065767145351917
that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200    1.7026049541338664
in New York City or Chicago. An average national figure for two    1.6432600607208703
to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000.   "Factors    1.6065767145351917
in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill    1.7026049541338664
and education of the practitioner", says Dr& Brodie.   To    1.5127085093302464
become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed by his state as    1.67495327387791
a dentist, then he must spend at least two years in additional training    1.67495327387791
to acquire a license as a specialist.   "Costs may seem high,    1.6065767145351917
but they used to be even higher", says Dr& Brodie. "Fees    1.6065767145351917
are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago".   The    1.7026049541338664
reason? People today are aware of the value of orthodontics, and    1.6065767145351917
as a result there are more practitioners in the field.   Most    1.6065767145351917
orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic    1.6065767145351917
materials and construction of the appliances, but usually the remainder    1.5636360329510388
of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years. In many    1.7269387314284994
cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools    1.5636360329510388
will take patients at a nominal fee. Some municipal agencies will    1.6065767145351917
pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents.    1.5127085093302464
GROWTH studies have been carried on consistently    1.3761581156320553
by orthodontists. Dr& Brodie has 30-year records of head growth,    1.5636360329510388
started 20 minutes after children's births.   "In the    1.4513752902486308
past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was    1.6432600607208703
scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics <do> affect tooth    1.6065767145351917
formation to a large extent", he says. "Fortunately through our    1.5636360329510388
growth studies we have been able to see what nature does, and that    1.67495327387791
helps us know what we can do".   This knowledge both modifies    1.6065767145351917
and dictates diagnosis and treatment. For example, a boy may inherit    1.6065767145351917
a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another. In the past    1.7026049541338664
an orthodontist might have tried, over four or five years, to straighten    1.6432600607208703
and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth,    1.67495327387791
would never accommodate them. Now a dentist can recommend extraction    1.5636360329510388
immediately.   In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge    1.5127085093302464
of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five    1.5636360329510388
years before treatment. The child is kept on call, and the orthodontist    1.6432600607208703
watches the growth. "Nature often takes care of the problem",    1.5636360329510388
says Dr& Brodie. "A child with a certain type of head and teeth    1.67495327387791
will outgrow tooth deformity".   That is why Dr& Brodie    1.5127085093302464
asks parents not to insist, against their dentist's advice, that their    1.6065767145351917
child have orthodontic work done too early. "Both because of our    1.6065767145351917
culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions,    1.5127085093302464
some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it    1.67495327387791
is wise to do so. Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start    1.7026049541338664
treatment", he urges.   Superior new material for orthodontic    1.4513752902486308
work is another result of research. Plastics are easier to handle    1.6065767145351917
than the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save time and money.    1.6432600607208703
Plaster of Paris, once utilized in making impressions of teeth, has    1.6065767145351917
been replaced by alginates (gelatin-like material) that work quickly    1.5127085093302464
and accurately and with least discomfort to a child.    1.5127085093302464
AS a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is started,    1.5636360329510388
the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.   1.6065767145351917
"After your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age    1.6432600607208703
of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment",    1.7026049541338664
Dr& Brodie advises. "Then see that your youngster    1.4513752902486308
has a routine checkup once a year".   To help prevent orthodontic    1.6065767145351917
problems from arising, your dentist can do these things: _@_    1.5127085093302464
He can correct decay, thus preventing early loss of teeth. If    1.6065767145351917
a child <does> lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay-    1.6065767145351917
and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out    1.67495327387791
of position, become overcrowded and malformed. In turn the other teeth    1.6065767145351917
are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.    1.6432600607208703
From time to time the medium mentions other people "around him",    1.6065767145351917
who were "on the other side", and reports what they are saying. After    1.67495327387791
a while there come initials and names, and he is interested to hear    1.67495327387791
some rather unusual family nicknames. As the hour progresses, the    1.5636360329510388
sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific    1.67495327387791
ANOTHER MEDIUM, another sitter, would produce a somewhat different    1.5127085093302464
content, but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing    1.6432600607208703
reading. Some mediums speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while    1.5127085093302464
others may stress the spiritual. Not all, as a matter of fact, consider    1.67495327387791
themselves "mediums" in the sense of receiving messages from    1.5127085093302464
the deceased. In fact, some sensitives rule this out, preferring to    1.6065767145351917
consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception    1.3761581156320553
(~ESP),    1.0
on this side of the "veil". However that may be, people are    1.6432600607208703
known to go to mediums for diverse reasons. Perhaps they are mourning    1.6432600607208703
a recent death and want comfort, to feel in touch with the deceased,    1.67495327387791
or seek indications for future plans. They may, of course, be curiosity    1.6432600607208703
seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.   1.6432600607208703
The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation    1.3761581156320553
is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated    1.67495327387791
state, so that the sitter can make comments, ask and answer questions,    1.6432600607208703
instead of talking with a "control" who speaks through an    1.5636360329510388
entranced sensitive. What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary    1.7026049541338664
conversation.   But it is not really only a conversation.    1.5127085093302464
Many a sitter (in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize that    1.67495327387791
the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind. He himself    1.6432600607208703
might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent,    1.7026049541338664
unspecified, semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she    1.4513752902486308
described it to him! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability    1.6065767145351917
to put a finger on "pre-conscious" moods and to clarify them.   1.6065767145351917
However, in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium,    1.6432600607208703
he did not receive a personal reading. Instead he brought with    1.6065767145351917
him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium    1.7269387314284994
AS    1.0
WAS NOTED earlier, it is important that in valid, objective study of    1.6432600607208703
this sort of communication, the interested sitter should be separated    1.5636360329510388
from the sensitive. Dr& Karlis Osis, Director of Research at    1.5636360329510388
the Parapsychology Foundation, described the basis for the experiment    1.5127085093302464
in a TOMORROW article, ("New Research on Survival After    1.5127085093302464
Death", Spring 1958). He remarked: "It has been clearly established    1.5636360329510388
that in a number of instances the message did not come from a    1.67495327387791
spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter".   1.6065767145351917
The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ~ESP    1.6065767145351917
may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this, the two central    1.7026049541338664
characters in this drama must be separated.   One way to do    1.6065767145351917
this is by "proxy sittings", wherein the person seeking a message    1.6065767145351917
does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute,    1.67495327387791
the proxy sitter. If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter    1.6432600607208703
except his name (given by the experimenter), he cannot possibly    1.5636360329510388
give any clues, conscious or unconscious, far less ask leading questions.    1.6065767145351917
All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner, seeking    1.67495327387791
to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal    1.6432600607208703
impressions.   Sometimes in these experiments "appointment    1.2818970554302986
sittings" are used. Here the absent sitter makes a "date"    1.5636360329510388
with a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased), asking him    1.6432600607208703
to "come in" at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for    1.7026049541338664
him. In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator,    1.7269387314284994
nothing else. He gives this to the medium at the appointed    1.6065767145351917
time, and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages    1.67495327387791
from the communicator. As always, a tape recording or detailed    1.5636360329510388
notes are made, and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.   1.7026049541338664
So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier    1.6432600607208703
between the medium's ~ESP and the absent sitter's mind. It    1.5636360329510388
is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though    1.67495327387791
research still does not know how far afield ~ESP <can> range.    1.6065767145351917
NOW THE ORIGINAL absent sitter must decide whether the    1.5127085093302464
statements are meaningful to <him>. Here again laboratory approaches    1.5127085093302464
are being evolved, for it is recognized how "elastic" these readings    1.6065767145351917
can be, how they can apply to many people, and are often stated    1.67495327387791
in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case.    1.6432600607208703
If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you will probably    1.67495327387791
see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you,    1.67495327387791
even when you were not in the picture at all! An interested sitter    1.67495327387791
may think the sensitive has made a "hit", describing something accurately    1.6065767145351917
for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter, hearing    1.6432600607208703
the same statement, would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances?    1.6432600607208703
It is, of course, easy to see how "~J" will mean    1.6065767145351917
Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another. "A journey",    1.6432600607208703
"a    1.0
little white house", "a change of outlook", can apply to many    1.6065767145351917
people. And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform    1.6065767145351917
to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal. One sitter    1.7026049541338664
may think "a leather couch" identifies a reading as surely directed    1.6065767145351917
to him; to another, it seems that nobody but his father ever    1.6432600607208703
used the phrase, "Atta boy"!   To get around this quite difficult    1.6065767145351917
corner, there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the    1.5636360329510388
distant sitter from knowing which reading <was> for him. If he is    1.6432600607208703
not told which of four or five readings was meant for him, he can more    1.7269387314284994
readily assess each item in a larger frame: "Does that statement    1.6065767145351917
really sound as if it were for me, significant in my particular life?    1.67495327387791
Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody,    1.6432600607208703
and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar    1.6065767145351917
experience"?   Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive    1.3761581156320553
such statements as the following, which, if they turned out    1.5636360329510388
to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:   "He    1.6432600607208703
had four children, two sets of twins. After being a lawyer for twenty-five    1.67495327387791
years he started studying for the ministry. Part of his house    1.6065767145351917
had been moved to the other side of the road. He died of typhoid in    1.7269387314284994
1921".   Methods have been developed of assigning "weights"    1.4513752902486308
to statements; that is, it is known empirically that names beginning    1.6065767145351917
with ~R are more common than those beginning with ~Z; that    1.6065767145351917
fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth; that in the United    1.6065767145351917
States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox. So each reading    1.67495327387791
can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these    1.7026049541338664
weights. Specific dates would be important, as would double names.    1.5636360329510388
Various categories have been explored to find out about these "empirical    1.6065767145351917
IN    1.0
THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION'S long-range experiment, readings    1.2818970554302986
are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating    1.67495327387791
sitters, trying to throw light on this question of the significance    1.6065767145351917
of mediumistic statements. It is very important indeed, in the field    1.6065767145351917
of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis,    1.5636360329510388
to know whether the statements are actually only those which any    1.6065767145351917
intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.    1.6065767145351917
Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated, facts which are    1.67495327387791
in themselves significant and <not> easily applicable to everybody?    1.5127085093302464
That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.   1.6065767145351917
So, after the sitting has been held, several readings at one time    1.6432600607208703
are mailed, and the distant sitter (whose name or whose communicator's    1.6065767145351917
name was given to the medium) must mark each little item as Correct    1.67495327387791
(Hit), Incorrect (Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant (applying    1.4513752902486308
to him and, he feels, not to anyone else). He is required to    1.67495327387791
mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.    1.67495327387791
All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated, by adding    1.6065767145351917
up the Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those in the    1.67495327387791
sitter's own reading. That is, if he marks as most correct a reading    1.67495327387791
<not> meant for him, the total experimental score falls.   Conversely,    1.5636360329510388
if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading, and finds more    1.67495327387791
accurate facts in it than in the others, a point is chalked up for    1.7026049541338664
the intrinsic, objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material.    1.5636360329510388
And there are some positive results, though the final findings    1.5636360329510388
will not be known for a long time- and then further research can    1.67495327387791
be formulated.   In another approach to the same procedure, the    1.5636360329510388
content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium    1.7026049541338664
is likely to slant her statements. Does she often speak of locations,    1.6432600607208703
of cause of death? Does she accurately give dates, ages, kind    1.6065767145351917
of occupation? It is possible to find out in which categories most    1.6432600607208703
of her correct statements fall, and where she makes most of her "hits".    1.67495327387791
Now when, so to speak, the cream has been skimmed off, and the    1.67495327387791
items in the successful categories separated out, the sitter can be asked    1.6432600607208703
to consider and rate only this concentrated "cream", where the    1.5636360329510388
MEDIUMISTIC IMPRESSIONS are evidently    1.0
of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses. "I feel cold",    1.67495327387791
the medium says, or "My leg aches", "My head is heavy".    1.6065767145351917
Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: "There's such a noise    1.6065767145351917
of loud machinery", or "I hear a child crying", or "He says    1.6432600607208703
we're all here and glad to see you". Maybe an entire scene comes    1.67495327387791
into consciousness, with action and motion, or a static view: "a    1.6065767145351917
house under a pine tree, with a little stone path going up to the door".    1.7269387314284994
The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors, too, or subjectively    1.6065767145351917
feels emotions. Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery    1.4513752902486308
and seems to see all details in perspective, as if the scene were actually    1.7026049541338664
there. If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she may be able    1.67495327387791
to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply, almost    1.6432600607208703
as if she were physically going closer.   If asked how she gets    1.6432600607208703
her impressions, she probably can only say that she "just gets them"-    1.6432600607208703
some more vividly than others. Perhaps this is not so extraordinary    1.6065767145351917
after all. Even in normal experience one gets impressions without    1.5636360329510388
knowing exactly how- of atmosphere, of one another's personalities,    1.5127085093302464
moods, intentions.   Of course, there is an element of training    1.5636360329510388
here: these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance,    1.4513752902486308
have    1.0
learned to develop their power. Simply <using> it increases its intensity,    1.6065767145351917
I was told by one sensitive.   Nor does a medium automatically    1.6065767145351917
know how to interpret her imagery. Impressions often appear in    1.5636360329510388
a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value. It is apparently    1.67495327387791
by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious, and the medium    1.6432600607208703
has to translate these into meaning. If communication with an entity    1.6065767145351917
on the "other side" is taking place, this too may assume the form    1.67495327387791
of clairvoyant symbolism.   During one reading an image appeared    1.5127085093302464
of a prisoner in irons. But this did not necessarily refer to an    1.67495327387791
actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state    1.67495327387791
of mental or spiritual confinement. In this connection it is worth    1.6065767145351917
noting how names are sometimes obtained. Though they are often heard    1.6065767145351917
clairaudiently, as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they    1.6432600607208703
are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name    1.6065767145351917
"Hill", for instance. One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line    1.6432600607208703
and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter.    1.6065767145351917
_@_ Farming is confining. The farmer's life must be arranged    1.5127085093302464
to meet the demands of crops and livestock.   Livestock must be    1.6065767145351917
tended every day, routinely. A slight change in the work schedule may    1.6432600607208703
cut the production of cows or chickens.   Even if there are no    1.6432600607208703
livestock, the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods, particularly    1.6065767145351917
during the growing season.   The worker who lives on a farm    1.6065767145351917
cannot change jobs readily. He cannot leave the farm to take work    1.6432600607208703
in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of    1.7026049541338664
capital. _@_ Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part    1.5636360329510388
of farm life. The farmer must get up early, and, at times, work late    1.7026049541338664
at night. Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold    1.7026049541338664
rain. No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected    1.6432600607208703
setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.   It may    1.6432600607208703
not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery    1.6432600607208703
that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably. _@_ Production    1.5127085093302464
may fall far below expectations. Drought, hail, disease, and insects    1.5636360329510388
take their toll of crops. Sickness or loss of some of the livestock    1.67495327387791
may cut into the owner's earnings, even into his capital. _@_    1.5636360329510388
Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good    1.67495327387791
year.   The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult    1.6432600607208703
to farm profitably on a part-time basis. Land within commuting    1.5636360329510388
distance of a growing city is usually high in price, higher if it has    1.7026049541338664
subdivision possibilities. Part-time farmers generally must pay higher    1.4513752902486308
prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller    1.6065767145351917
quantities. If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high,    1.67495327387791
farm labor costs will also be high.   A part-time farmer needs    1.6065767145351917
unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre    1.7026049541338664
as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer. It will frequently    1.6432600607208703
be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment. He    1.6065767145351917
may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations,    1.5636360329510388
such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his    1.7026049541338664
turn. There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he    1.6432600607208703
is away at his off-farm job. _@_ The farm may be an additional    1.6432600607208703
burden if the main job is lost. This may be true whether the farm is    1.7269387314284994
owned or rented.   If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid.    1.67495327387791
If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free    1.7269387314284994
of mortgage, there will be interest and    1.3761581156320553
payments on the principal to take care of. _ADVANTAGES_ _@_A    1.5636360329510388
farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children.    1.5127085093302464
It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air. The children can    1.7026049541338664
do chores adapted to their age and ability. Caring for a calf, a pig,    1.7026049541338664
or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for    1.6065767145351917
work. _@_ Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the    1.5636360329510388
regular job is lost, <provided> the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes    1.7026049541338664
enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs.    1.5636360329510388
_@_ For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way    1.5636360329510388
to supplement retirement income. It is particularly suitable for those    1.5636360329510388
who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health. _@_    1.6432600607208703
Generally, the s    1.0
ame level of living costs less in the country than    1.5636360329510388
in the city. The savings are not as great, however, as is sometime supposed.    1.7026049541338664
Usually, the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on    1.6432600607208703
the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more.    1.6065767145351917
Where schools, fire and police protection, and similar municipal services    1.5636360329510388
are of equal quality in city and country, real estate taxes are    1.6432600607208703
usually about the same. _@_ A part-time farmer and his family can    1.6065767145351917
use their spare time profitably. _@_ Some persons consider the    1.5127085093302464
work on a farm recreational. For some white-collar workers it is a    1.6432600607208703
welcome change from the regular job, and a physical conditioner.    1.5636360329510388
Part-time farming can take comparatively    1.1606783668269585
little land, labor, and equipment- or a great deal. It depends    1.6065767145351917
on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.   General    1.6065767145351917
requirements for land, labor, and equipment are discussed below. Specific    1.5636360329510388
requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed    1.5636360329510388
on pages 8 to 14. _LAND_ Three quarters to 1 acre of good land    1.7026049541338664
is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a    1.67495327387791
small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs. You could not, of course,    1.7026049541338664
raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.   If you    1.6432600607208703
want to    1.0
raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll    1.6432600607208703
need more land.   In deciding how much land you want, take into    1.6432600607208703
account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect. But    1.67495327387791
consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your    1.7026049541338664
other work. The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in    1.6432600607208703
value may influence your decision. Some part-time farmers buy more    1.5636360329510388
land than they need in anticipation of suburban development. This is    1.6065767145351917
a highly speculative venture.   Sometimes a desired acreage is offered    1.5636360329510388
only as part of a larger tract. When surplus land is not expensive    1.67495327387791
to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy    1.748515906000203
so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might    1.6065767145351917
impair the residential value of the farm. _LABOR_ If you have a    1.6432600607208703
year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your    1.6432600607208703
family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of    1.67495327387791
the work or you hire help. As a rule, part-time farmers hire little    1.67495327387791
help.   In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor,    1.6432600607208703
compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with    1.67495327387791
the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.   List    1.6065767145351917
the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.    1.67495327387791
You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have    1.67495327387791
one. Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare    1.67495327387791
time- only what you are willing to use for farm work. _EQUIPMENT_    1.6432600607208703
If you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only    1.7026049541338664
hand tools. You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing,    1.67495327387791
however.   For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power    1.5636360329510388
for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating. If you have a planting    1.6065767145351917
of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor    1.7269387314284994
(available for $300 to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices). These    1.5636360329510388
tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier    1.5636360329510388
soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.   1.67495327387791
Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the    1.6432600607208703
small-scale farmer. If you are going to farm for extra cash income on    1.67495327387791
a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments    1.6432600607208703
when you choose among farm enterprises.   You can keep your    1.5636360329510388
machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing    1.5636360329510388
the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring    1.6432600607208703
someone with machinery to do certain jobs. If an expensive and specialized    1.6432600607208703
piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig, a combine,    1.6432600607208703
or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.    1.748515906000203
Before you look for a farm you'll need    1.4513752902486308
to know (1) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and    1.7026049541338664
(2)    1.0
whether you want to buy or rent.   Information on pages 8 to 14    1.67495327387791
may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.   1.7026049541338664
If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish    1.67495327387791
to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like    1.7269387314284994
and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent    1.67495327387791
a place for a year or two before you buy.   Discussed below are    1.67495327387791
some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.    1.7026049541338664
_LOCATION_ _NEARNESS TO WORK.-_ Choose a location within easy    1.5127085093302464
commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.    1.6065767145351917
Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell    1.6065767145351917
the farm. The presence of alternative job opportunities also will    1.5636360329510388
make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.    1.6065767145351917
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road. _NEARNESS TO    1.6065767145351917
MARKETS.-_ If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.    1.6432600607208703
If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example,    1.6432600607208703
you should be close to a town or city. _KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-_    1.6432600607208703
Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes. There are slums    1.67495327387791
in the country as well as in the city. Few rural areas are protected    1.7026049541338664
by zoning. A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant,    1.5636360329510388
or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to    1.7269387314284994
hurt its value. _FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-_ Check on the schools    1.6065767145351917
in the area, the quality of teaching, and the provision for transportation    1.6432600607208703
to and from them.   Find out whether fire protection, sewage    1.5636360329510388
system, gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available in the    1.6065767145351917
locality. If these facilities are not at the door, getting them may    1.6432600607208703
cost more than you expect. You may have to provide them yourself or    1.67495327387791
get along without them.   You cannot get along without an adequate    1.6065767145351917
supply of pure water. If you are considering a part-time farm where    1.6432600607208703
the water must be provided by a well, find out if there is a good well    1.748515906000203
on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled. A pond may    1.7026049541338664
provide adequate water for livestock and garden. Pond water can be filtered    1.6432600607208703
for human use, but most part-time farmers would not want to go    1.6432600607208703
to so much trouble. The following amounts of water are needed per day    1.67495327387791
for livestock and domestic uses. _TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL_ Is the land    1.6065767145351917
suited to the crops you intend to raise? If you can't tell, get    1.67495327387791
help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist.    1.5636360329510388
Soil type, drainage, or degree of slope can make the difference between    1.6432600607208703
good crops and poor ones. Small areas that aren't right for a certain    1.67495327387791
crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop. _THE    1.7026049541338664
HOUSE_ Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering    1.6065767145351917
make a satisfactory full-time residence? How much will it cost to    1.6065767145351917
do any necessary modernizing and redecorating? If the house is not    1.6065767145351917
wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating    1.6065767145351917
system must be installed, check into the cost of making these improvements.    1.6432600607208703
The value of the farm to you will depend    1.5127085093302464
on- _@_ Its worth as a place to live. _@_ The value of    1.6065767145351917
the products you can raise on it. _@_ The possibilities of selling    1.6065767145351917
the property later on for suburban subdivision.   Decide first    1.5127085093302464
what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison    1.7269387314284994
with what it would cost to live in town. Take into account the difference    1.7026049541338664
in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility rates, and    1.5636360329510388
the cost of travel to work.   Next, estimate the value of possible    1.6432600607208703
earnings of the farm. To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating    1.7269387314284994
the farm. List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be    1.67495327387791
expected to produce in an average year. Estimate the value of the produce    1.67495327387791
at normal prices. The total is the probable gross income from farming.   1.6432600607208703
To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated    1.4513752902486308
annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming. Include    1.5636360329510388
as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings    1.5127085093302464
and equipment. Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be    1.7026049541338664
contributed by the family. It may be hard to decide what this labor    1.67495327387791
is worth, but charge something for it. Otherwise, you may pay too much    1.67495327387791
for the farm and get nothing for your labor.   To figure the    1.6432600607208703
value of the farm in terms of investment income, divide the estimated    1.6432600607208703
annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get    1.67495327387791
in interest if the money were invested in some other way.    1.6065767145351917
Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his    1.7026049541338664
day in court as in some vast collective dirge. For almost two months,    1.67495327387791
the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the    1.6065767145351917
grave about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents, babies, starved,    1.5127085093302464
beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned, gassed, burned. One    1.4513752902486308
who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected    1.7269387314284994
by height for the gas chambers. The gruesome humor of the Nazis    1.6432600607208703
was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name    1.7026049541338664
of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David- nor    1.6432600607208703
the gratuitous sadism of ~SS officers. Public relations strategists    1.5127085093302464
everywhere, watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal    1.5636360329510388
press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their neighbors, studying    1.5127085093302464
interviews with men and women on the street, cried out: Too much,    1.6432600607208703
too much- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors    1.6432600607208703
are losing their effect. And still another witness, one who had crawled    1.6432600607208703
out from under a heap of corpses, had to tell how the victims had    1.7026049541338664
been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before    1.7269387314284994
being shot. **h   Most of this testimony may have been legally    1.6065767145351917
admissible as bearing on the <corpus delicti> of the total Nazi    1.6065767145351917
crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it    1.7026049541338664
of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs. Counsel for the    1.5636360329510388
defense, however, shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current    1.6065767145351917
of dreadful recollections, rarely raised an objection. Would not the    1.5636360329510388
emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming,    1.6065767145351917
if not exhausting, effect likely to improve his client's chances?    1.5636360329510388
Those who feared "emotionalism" at the Trial showed less    1.5127085093302464
understanding than Dr& Servatius of the route by which man achieves    1.6065767145351917
the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies. Interruptions    1.4513752902486308
came    1.0
largely from the bench, which numerous times rebuked the Attorney    1.5636360329510388
General for letting his witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious    1.67495327387791
effort to choke off the flow.   But there was a contrast even    1.6432600607208703
more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem    1.6432600607208703
and those in Moscow and New York. In each of the last, the trial    1.7026049541338664
<marked the beginning of a new course:> in Moscow the liquidation    1.6065767145351917
of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship;    1.5636360329510388
in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism,    1.5127085093302464
with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard. These trials were    1.5636360329510388
properly termed "political cases" in that the trial itself was    1.5636360329510388
a political act producing political consequences. But what could the    1.5636360329510388
Eichmann Trial initiate? Of what new course could it mark the beginning?    1.6432600607208703
The Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future.    1.6065767145351917
It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection,    1.7026049541338664
and of refining the recollection, that will last as long as there    1.6432600607208703
are Jews. As such, it was beyond politics and had no need of justification    1.7026049541338664
"IT IS NOT AN individual    1.1606783668269585
that is in the dock at this historical trial"- said Ben Gurion,    1.6432600607208703
"and not the Nazi regime alone- but anti-Semitism throughout    1.5127085093302464
history". How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to    1.6065767145351917
maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews    1.6432600607208703
<without being an anti-Semite> contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism?    1.5636360329510388
And if it was not an individual who was in the dock, why    1.67495327387791
was the Trial, as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the    1.67495327387791
attempt to prove Eichmann a "fiend"? These questions touch the    1.5636360329510388
root of confusion in the prosecution's case.   It might be contended,    1.6065767145351917
of course, that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic    1.4513752902486308
