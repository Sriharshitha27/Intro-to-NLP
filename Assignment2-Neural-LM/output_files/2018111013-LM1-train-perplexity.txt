The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation    2.0824847811922282
of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence" that    1.9337960826501914
any irregularities took place.   The jury further said in term-end    2.1909983612943003
presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all    2.3981067468480353
charge of the election, "deserves the praise and thanks of the    2.607380921717696
City of Atlanta" for the manner in which the election was conducted.   2.892664894929566
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton    1.839337105210017
Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible    1.8852527701634951
"irregularities" in the hard-fought primary which was won by    2.055992852462416
Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr&.   "Only a relative handful    1.8742571983018361
of such reports was received", the jury said, "considering the    2.7118028342958955
widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size    3.388211804153566
of this city".   The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's    3.3489921756790744
registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate    1.774965958657291
and often ambiguous".   It recommended that Fulton legislators    1.9489535674476792
act "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing    2.840653541494492
and improving them".   The grand jury commented on a number    2.4096347177919046
of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing    2.414278334450605
departments which it said "are well operated and follow generally    2.1706386319154145
accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments".    2.2769596248168313
#MERGER PROPOSED#   1.179704317828762
However, the jury said it believes "these    2.5786739289698732
two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce    2.050188320664663
the cost of administration".   The City Purchasing Department,    2.476780668816556
the jury said, "is lacking in experienced clerical personnel    2.331733732129201
as a result of city personnel policies". It urged that the city "take    3.0182006480423094
steps to remedy" this problem.   Implementation of Georgia's    1.745456086154636
automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.   2.1365953469888335
It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling funds    2.2113386181163586
and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of    1.9628969196354071
the law may be effected".   The grand jury took a swipe at the    2.3615528891648228
State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for    2.0084499369021684
child welfare services in foster homes.   "This is one of the    2.0397710997823406
major items in the Fulton County general assistance program", the    2.158158882555685
jury said, but the State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute    2.3090330787759217
these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties    2.5851606017322135
in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives    3.434909763323629
none of this money.   The jurors said they realize "a proportionate    2.52137753469183
distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less    2.2950836792493297
populous counties".   Nevertheless, "we feel that in the    2.1725023645643327
future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available    1.9395416799368241
funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue to place    3.022794603946121
a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.   The jury    1.8371942807404076
also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under    2.3143457223508888
fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and    2.13905584109502
administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.    1.8139244417719995
#WARDS PROTECTED#    1.160063470696076
The jury said it found the court "has incorporated into    2.4344134913071387
its operating procedures the recommendations" of two previous grand    2.153059631086223
juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.   2.104518436166147
"These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms", the jury said.   Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended "that when the new management takes charge Jan& 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences".   3.5374281002626997
The jury did not elaborate, but it added that "there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable".   2.7127412362871572
#ASK JAIL DEPUTIES#   1.3595981013057423
On other matters, the jury recommended that: _(1)_ Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and "a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail". _(2)_ Fulton legislators "work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable" pension plan for city employes.   317.4805118231412
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.   2.515875669553673
Mayor William B& Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife, Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton Superior Court Friday. His petition charged mental cruelty.   The couple was married Aug& 2, 1913. They have a son, William Berry Jr&, and a daughter, Mrs& J& M& Cheshire of Griffin.   Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon.   The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney" and his age as 71. It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika, Ala&.   The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year.   3.7733436360728074
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E& Pelham Rd& ~NE.   5.526311487840078
Henry L& Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney.   2.1349502336991204
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception of one brief interlude, since 1937. His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923.   The mayor's present term of office expires Jan& 1. He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr&, who became a candidate in the Sept& 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection.   5.1630636526973746
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.   3.364053250028647
Robert Snodgrass, state ~GOP chairman, said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.   State Party Chairman James W& Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept& 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen& John Tower will be the featured speaker.   In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.   Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.   3.2617875060942407
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no- and there were no dissents.   3.3759102342712612
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a    2.7393906310476006
state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative    2.3999190592772703
courses must be taken: _1._ Five per cent of the voters    16.890940280487442
in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be    2.2184634023565937
allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot,    2.2347026890319843
or _2._ The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit    69.29078580047555
system- a system which the party opposes in its platform.   2.169138866055038
Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations director,    1.9404991061529517
resigned Tuesday to work for Lt& Gov& Garland Byrd's    1.826000993876378
campaign.   Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some    2.0319721271726325
time. He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville, who has    2.1529039336421643
been an assistant more than three years. When the gubernatorial campaign    2.5570056838278536
starts, Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for    2.648166823732633
Byrd.   1.0
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday    6.988445156764272
and head for home- where some of the highway bond money it approved    2.8349773837881007
will follow shortly.   Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the    1.8840943267817591
Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators    3.3699807286927883
allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should    2.1079231138502665
be made.   Gov& Vandiver is expected to make the traditional    3.2608739416577084
visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment. Vandiver likely    2.2028784840333593
will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier    5.075932427458841
in the session as his first priority item.    3.4983919534292833
#CONSTRUCTION BONDS#   1.1868689624522646
Meanwhile,    1.0
it was learned the State Highway Department is very near    3.2439398438846774
being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction    5.289353602825438
bonds.   The bond issue will go to the state courts for a    2.627463496396963
friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales    2.4982024633841506
will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's    2.217980291119608
most heavily traveled highways.   A Highway Department source    1.8093826193445983
said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million    6.297918666911962
worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.    2.2291218137536224
#A REVOLVING FUND#   1.4450955480819523
The department apparently intends to make    1.9638541208901925
the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would    2.1590132124655033
be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax    2.863552706451144
authorities.   Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with    4.011551741156747
a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth    4.189069222025896
of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov& Marvin    2.0615660565353995
Griffin.   The Highway Department source told The Constitution,    2.0286064821171204
however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans    2.541022127790217
to issue the new rural roads bonds.   2.050152895576097
Schley County Rep& B& D& Pelham will offer a resolution    1.9447848683024072
Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in    2.6118724683462067
voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.   Pelham    6.459600362401238
said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the    2.224069399555021
"quickie" vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether    2.1706848957820966
notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action    2.7079883783961627
would be sought.   While emphasizing that technical details were    2.487687832352057
not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set    2.161367438740288
aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31.   2.7032485920498006
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5.    3.08033517451458
As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered    2.800578604933885
there to rescind the action.   Pelham pointed out that Georgia    2.0584170435487037
voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators    2.028177017376537
to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.   2.0530433573200315
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House    2.0315583709870446
Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently    2.050213795037899
opposed in the past.   Rep& Mac Barber of Commerce is    2.635863493164202
asking the House in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal    2.24292252842932
support for public education, provided that such funds be received    2.2054750901005993
and expended" as state funds.   Barber, who is in his 13th    3.989164291041755
year as a legislator, said there "are some members of our congressional    2.9241570800153704
delegation in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution)    2.459746945154313
passed". But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically    2.210080254405853
asked him to offer the resolution.   The resolution, which    2.352298390972476
Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, will be formally read    2.1029540735266696
Monday. It says that "in    1.9578693610479436
the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds", the    2.26102404853372
State Board of Education should be directed to "give priority"    2.4149306173281553
to teacher pay raises. _COLQUITT_- After a long, hot controversy,    201.2213829435412
Miller County has a new school superintendent, elected, as a    2.195699890354257
policeman put it, in the "coolest election I ever saw in this county".   2.433906740644827
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran    2.5146992122923795
agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and    1.9189620072672597
chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.   2.2727935690287793
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush    6.123146444368294
got 402. Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with a pistol, stood by at    2.75059155188819
the polls to insure order.   "This was the coolest, calmest    2.3936925075199986
election I ever saw", Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said. "Being    1.7789598624191783
at the polls was just like being at church. I didn't smell    2.811088920774613
a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble".   The    2.5883767855998276
campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however. It was    2.6702564577708228
marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats    1.8671630401360468
of violence.   The former county school superintendent, George    2.0514781155733197
P& Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he    4.087471600782317
resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.   During    2.1631548953469553
the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly    1.904554181330018
received anonymous telephone calls. Ordinary Williams said he,    1.9051213199582822
too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.   2.0486934342241945
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities    2.2105222244902394
at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun    2.676296012335833
and promised an orderly election.   Sheriff Felix Tabb said the    1.8738102384295163
ordinary apparently made good his promise.   "Everything went    1.8139738622085375
real smooth", the sheriff said. "There wasn't a bit of trouble".    2.0841379118440977
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Committee approval of Gov& Price Daniel's    237.0339393377621
"abandoned property" act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant    1.856894761564142
protests of Texas bankers.   Daniel personally led the fight    1.977180897434465
for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its    3.3525321367918868
rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before    2.236218562965845
the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.   Under committee    2.2771377556036296
rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week. But    2.103440363520065
questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses    1.9241023082137865
left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.   2.4018005519948686
Daniel termed "extremely conservative" his estimate that it would    2.096334720677403
produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of    2.6216451208734664
63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug&    3.162571797113762
31.   He told the committee the measure would merely provide means    2.5077744116792826
of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books "since    2.61130076095322
Texas was a republic". It permits the state to take over bank accounts,    2.288490544707599
stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven    2.0998306158754807
years or more.   The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally,    2.444998451807212
would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other    1.9592000517488235
corporations to report such property to the state treasurer. The escheat    2.5537387473292443
law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate    2.6188691779515967
such property, Daniel declared.   Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler    1.7816242735752132
lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition    1.9617858102675756
keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual    2.4683511906669566
obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank    1.7858668512953066
customers.   "If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something    2.0165309370950446
to the economy", he said. "You take out of circulation many    3.4193741294878808
millions of dollars".   Rep& Charles E& Hughes of Sherman,    2.2107229514211997
sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount "to    2.385088704235962
making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance    2.8480068193794996
and pipeline companies".   His contention was denied by several    1.8458066002857725
bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B& Jones    1.796981562847583
of Houston, J& B& Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.   1.962303618132389
Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"    2.271553311472032
since, he said, it would impair contracts.   He also complained    2.343293171580546
that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was    2.477404224038459
introduced only last Monday.    1.5928481467649127
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill    180.3798739375498
of Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment    1.700491935912805
of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.   2.3751394425606196
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more    2.5335621806136235
deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.   2.263259952360493
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the    2.9396019486662914
House.   It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish    1.994367530585971
county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or    3.055330444267309
more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age    9.507585882305982
to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential    2.635201063668909
Texas School for the Deaf here.   Operating budget for the    2.3242584609990935
day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant    2.388134863519206
and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460    9.042263680337566
yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed,    9.397072457459325
Parkhouse told the Senate.   The ~TEA estimated there    1.9878461266642284
would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County,    5.682135936048231

An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee    11.450978707505092

Texas votes on a U&S& senator.   Rep& Wesley Roberts    1.833138355823523
of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the    2.1153345802565893

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas'    75.22490749029951
big cities Thursday.   Rep& James Cotten of Weatherford    1.7126752354998307
insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House    2.429429097098928
of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort    2.292789553147277
Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet    1.927055946637673
of 250 people.   When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114    3.869962726349933
to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored    3.326143461170877
by Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas.   Most of the fire    2.8150079806356936
was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen& Parkhouse. The    2.094209995811768
bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan    9.652359940708989
the state could make to a local water project.   Cotten construed    2.623358746945116
this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large    2.2103624488051294
cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing    1.9458076405367746
water for rural Texas.   Statements by other legislators that    1.920219511786523
Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less    2.345620746568173
populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway    2.0215029642253484

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- A Houston teacher, now serving in the Legislature,    220.2880404758183

methods".   Rep& Henry C& Grover, who teaches    1.6927729050774287

obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate. A normal    2.0250976197561323
year's work in college is 30 semester hours.   Grover also would    3.112719309985914

long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ~ADC    1.9399714352800348
case load. The report called racial discrimination in employment "one    2.0523718813858833

The monthly cost    1.5465212220361917

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made    1.8129312629564351
statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge    2.407638936896392

"The statements may be highly prejudicial to my    2.0164723868700207
client", Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly    2.733377879827483
indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property. It is impossible    2.0585011932481443
to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements    2.69107627330566

the bench and inquired, "You mean some of the defendants made statements    2.2549169455961113
admitting this"?   "Yes, your honor", replied    1.6320322029454848
Bellows. "What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all    2.7000293134120685

The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov& 8 election    10.151665483806637
were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M& Karns, who    1.9777771989922346
charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally    2.0084031969209546
illegal means".   Karns said that the cases involved a    2.3920659069735493
matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"    2.2414715303177193
of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in violation of    5.258359709368471
the legal rights of citizens".   Karns' ruling pertained to    1.9293287640799206
eight of the 10 cases. In the two other cases he ruled that the state    5.253877329092546
had been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings originally    3.084023130710756
had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J&    11.267551376587797

#ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS#   1.2389085198246583
Wexler    1.0
admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas    1.93968672725371
to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned    7.788295978954553
the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them    2.317422492893706
before the grand jury.   Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election    2.2681604834878066
judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure    14.840674592813217
constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion    1.6776691689786445
was used in questioning.   Karns said it was a "wrongful act"    2.8463158510905533
for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand    2.240119115515109
jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious misuse"    2.205312561885354
of the Criminal court processes.   "Actually, the abuse of the    3.356337302133875
process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook    2.09035865574653
county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the    2.3839021203200645
function of this court", said Karns, who is a City judge in East    2.6113504203751403

Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35    2.7804470123676706
persons. Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with    2.0997187692157646
"complementary" miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken    2.3900396966588136
from one candidate and given to another.   The cases involved    2.2878663421264234

and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.   The case of the judges    14.95612013703332
in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken    13.184185822688125
under advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under advisement.    2.1350966617665934
#CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING#   1.3407307886990254
After reading his statement discharging    1.5870524233671337
the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases    5.4579375570355655
scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he    2.427152804356013
would dismiss them.    1.3375515836946854
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth    257.29530155045273
new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million    4.811621853699305
American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other    2.6507120551565087
medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by    18.07505720093957
social security or railroad retirement programs.   The President,    2.039968162594783
in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan    3.006819675890094
requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships,    2.3676255202216545
build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child    8.834532587272216
health care and general medical research.   The aged care plan,    1.9110968708617162
similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a    2.5578340940043285
fight on Capitol hill. It was defeated in Congress last year.    2.1930438009458464
#COST    1.0
UP TO $37 A YEAR#   5.696360771277543
It would be financed by boosting the social security    2.8666850139930125
payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now    4.3452718611414305
paying such taxes.   The social security payroll tax is now 6    2.4703441341798165
per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4,800    4.286593459780055
of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to    2.2411056071969258
$5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each.    10.410580012788932
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad    2.013542629938096
retirement system.   The payroll tax would actually rise    1.955480432984622
to 7.5 per cent starting Jan& 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because    9.81613181267322
the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date    4.880298916218647
to pay for other social security costs.    2.414411568938546
#OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE#    1.4697097326232382
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would    2.125201544221252
amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would    5.262322828462041
run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. Both figures would go    9.077796285277133
higher in later years.   Other parts of the Kennedy health plan    2.3082416126457006
would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over    8.565704936593665
the next 10 years. These would be paid for out of general, not payroll,    5.021279680632841
taxes.    1.0
#NURSING HOME CARE#   1.5231248988133872
The aged care plan carries these    1.7665621965800014
benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad    4.721233251051369
retirement systems: _1._ Full payment of hospital bills for    122.88058034306796
stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would    6.122280173068538
pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days. _2._ Full payment    40.922478167858095
of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from    3.578930921877167
a hospital. A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing    5.924731969408018
home care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care for those    2.265619356153604
who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit. _3._ Hospital    61.68886765909431
outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess    1.971851217414675
of $20 a patient. _4._ Community visiting nurse services at home    149.808051558603
for up to 240 days an illness.   The President noted that Congress    4.372499602908148
last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical    2.71623677314892
bills of the needy aged.    1.7268519442734818
#CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST#   1.3425909857769969
He said his    2.748990608000797
plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish    2.6977278970485528
to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless    2.134649434137587
staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-    2.2939452793991966
caused by an extended hospital stay".   "This is a very    2.4116652815704445
modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said,    2.0706442054655936
"and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any    2.2880824629212984
malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.   "This    1.8021401823312593
is not a program of socialized medicine. It is a program of prepayment    4.665849203462976
of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed. Every    2.17733577629656
person will choose his own doctor and hospital".    1.983476984640741
#WOULDN'T    1.0
PAY DOCTORS#   1.2166145168416729
The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still    2.4168075626950074
be paid by the patient.   Apart from the aged care plan the President's    2.7458100172537465
most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships,    1.8512184685370094
and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.   1.8917528075114272
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools    4.914802762305056
cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need    2.4935660645256768
for health care. Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are    2.11416023059807
not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the    2.1183031063848268
schooling costs.    1.1984148357152853
#CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS#   1.5492955776820765
The scholarship plan    1.4111781574146145
would    1.0
provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal    2.1840322933614456
to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students. The    5.0483523149337675
schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need,    5.758427198624452
of up to $2,000 a year per student.   In addition, the government    5.111810388332039
would pay a $1,000 "cost of education" grant to the schools for    6.082287938822778
each $1,500 in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined    4.6672439546221405
programs would cost    1.4647507722164919
5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21    4.063442789519289
millions by 1966.   The President recommended federal "matching    5.770000699807627
grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing    21.372241522325957
new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing    2.142017516833758
ones.    1.0
#MORE FOR NURSING HOMES#   1.597556030066312
In the area of "community health    3.9247367536124633
services", the President called for doubling the present 10 million    5.227814053554807
dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction. He asked    2.215517905777458
for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation for "stimulatory    7.158043379869937
grants" to states to improve nursing homes.   He further    2.0817596602089212
proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.   1.926702436905853
In the child health field, the President said he will recommend    4.090942425572444
later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.    2.160600331177149
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national    2.6992413080526054
child health institute.    1.395123490937635
#ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS#   1.3492155923467106
The President said    2.272351955559543
he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.    2.541231961501652
He did not say by how much.   For medical research    2.618805969481886
he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions,    20.613852141096736
in matching grants for building research facilities. The President    1.9169729970611116
said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540    3.219848483701326
million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research    5.611364464786932
in medicine.   The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable    2.3526898959654328
elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge,    2.23600921836229
services, facilities, and the means to pay for them".    2.6701429758287696
#REACTION    1.0
AS EXPECTED#   1.1939373588766304
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected    1.9836528764802
lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under    1.810024891603946
the social security system criticized the President's plan. Those    2.2995408687065373
who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.   Senate    2.154081018665339
Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill&] and House Republican Leader    1.805765455486855
Charles Halleck [Ind&] said the message did not persuade them    1.9983220484503275
to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance. Halleck    1.916930903893026
said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair    2.7103036733162322
trial first.   House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D&, Tex&]    1.852027383018391
called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction    2.365603841821686
on its fate in the House.    2.500770993124214
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- Acting hastily under White House pressure,    170.47565557015753
the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C& Weaver as the nation's    2.1603889842435673
federal housing chief.   Only 11 senators were on the floor    6.779839764931571
and there was no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and    3.3386108261949996
"noes" was heard.   Customary Senate rules were ignored in    1.8261867656945308
order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing    2.9378750552870274
and home finance agency.   In the last eight years, all    2.647904468498458
Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been    1.930525503957251
denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least    2.3920907299601817
a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.    3.506585818069877
#ENFORCE BY DEMAND#    1.429745255437322
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen& Wayne Morse [D&,    2.108996115487154
Ore&] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet    1.9635355865587
selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.    12.363730253153141
_OSLO_ The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting    202.39488387360507
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been    2.123131163516072
the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual    1.8503658764303417
understanding than in past meetings.   This has been a working    2.580570704246243
session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed    2.46675246410828
along its route step by step and without dramatic changes. In Oslo,    1.9979424810973871
the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine    2.492303813129365
attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.   2.358542544543704
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable    1.9556085806212973
where relations are concerned between the "colonialist" powers    1.8117187629648868
and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.    3.2973419181404555
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated    2.152473315718319
by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other    2.860842169013271
allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances    1.7276527914149074
that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by    2.0950889846828784
its absence.    1.1779971766735295
#EXPLOSION AVOIDED#   1.1991028058809452
In the case of Portugal, which    3.8227177483556263
a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the ~NATO Council    3.2354368993349527
should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been    2.016636380266432
a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general, remarkably courteous,    1.8807860432100942
explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been    2.014834864592305
no explosion in the council. There should even be no more bitter surprises    2.5774601967788424
in the ~UN General Assembly as to ~NATO members' votes,    3.5668964278001107
since a new ad hoc ~NATO committee has been set up so that    2.292646315643941
in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.   3.369115756821559
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt    2.0385212675490023
to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the ~NATO    2.58753112655082
locomotive. Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against    1.741355325945395
atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance,    2.6180627798762446
is today closer to the ~NATO line.   On the negative    2.1145681842547233
side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the    2.638868783679643
United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.    3.0662775647543827
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's    2.200082858252234
speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened to add that,    1.8980503309597974
if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr& Rusk's    2.0056997498305513
analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the    2.3129818929563273
West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly    2.487039400489724
fixed its policy.    1.3529209588120104
#EXPLORATORY MOOD#   1.1752418259775455
A certain vagueness may also    2.0809010424312526
be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council    2.579123434411292
meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents    2.158330726391053
accredited.   The impression has nevertheless been    1.7644399204230476
given during these three days, despite Mr& Rusk's personal popularity,    1.9857312427524372
that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat    3.438257167860499
tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn    2.078757352688005
than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application    2.1571335765354016
to individual danger spots.   The Secretary of State    2.227163920948124
himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of    2.8197969871927007
events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the    2.9055625855316114
new administration in the past four months.   But where the core    2.955816320624948
of ~NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only    2.4689313132440986
reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance,    2.8772340281423463
"cornerstone" of its foreign policy, but has announced that five    2.274039604458567
nuclear submarines will eventually be at ~NATO's disposal in    1.825335660285803
European waters.   The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated    2.147270910484805
a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will    3.471540664011459
not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken    2.089650648271281
up by the council as a whole.    2.8621659577249514
#CONFLICT SURVEYED#   1.0591686776574842
The secretary's    1.2384433039611358
greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of ~NATO realization    1.9349922465463412
that East-West friction, wherever it take place around the    1.861768889375893
globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different    2.243530489371056
societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical    2.2007858270476346
distance or lack of apparent connection.   The annual spring    1.9749197124723725
meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more, deeper,    1.933289720348928
and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use    2.2949911052898324
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (when    3.541946765742757
ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries,    2.070473211413101
and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the    3.792736889210525
maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.   This increase in the    2.4371745415746853
"threshold", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will    2.056222482075583
prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months    3.2814321725541093
to come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid    2.9954558896583694
down, but never completely fulfilled.    1.7470970569813637
_WASHINGTON_ The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a    42.16857199705089
Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy    2.0647660086795434
erupts for the first time.   There is little optimism here    2.9162703051560723
that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table    3.3085016031148116
than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.   The    2.75663825119688
United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly    2.613349015553737
interested in setting up an international inspection system which will    2.4694983319787265
prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring    2.3070774442131756
Thailand and South Viet Nam.   They count on the aid    2.116769636648655
of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve    3.4578426143530225
this.   The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet    3.002746308280082
would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent that no acceptable    3.1537889519485107
formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.    2.39423783696883
#POLICIES MODIFIED#   1.178253254623631
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire    2.205711497100265
in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the    2.3264158186211015
cease-fire by the international control commission before participating    1.917993067029152
in the Geneva conference.   This is another of the modifications    3.867866707399831
of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled    2.5099417497766385
to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to    2.653490237662689
basic errors made in the previous administration.   Its spokesmen    2.4362842705759697
insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in    2.7037855413212286
military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.   But    2.1149144123324315
with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the    3.0446795103577955
Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:   2.453720981183217
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy    1.8550483337364532
decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?   Former    1.8215212133717607
Vice-President Richard M& Nixon in Detroit called for a    2.174168700515829
firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union. He was critical    2.4106100547671754
of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.    2.994707978537262
#~GOP RESTRAINED#   1.0712195035691006
It does not take a Gallup poll to    2.384471294669746
find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the    2.2354042533369816
situation as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves    2.1444156209281444
from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been    2.663351486627488
in power, would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders" in    2.089345163689008
Cuba.   One Republican senator told this correspondent that he    1.8911715418052302
was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration    2.028489446013008
on this score. His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the    2.907130033970874
need for unity in the country now. But he further said that it was    3.426501544180879
better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies    2.1728381814596274
first.   The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through    2.2254761728277206
Senator Thruston B& Morton (~R) of Kentucky, chairman    1.6856824833498403
of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration    3.7707370149210564
would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition    3.0499569533782664
government susceptible of Communist domination.   Kennedy administration    1.8463937022218162
policies also have been assailed now from another direction    2.07477114127654
by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute    2.455456060905524
of Technology educators.    1.4550123885115391
#DETENTE URGED#   1.2200710644314805
This group pleads    1.4252081642285912
with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion    3.124878489685619
of Cuba by exile groups". It recommends that the United States    1.9208423533874033
"seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc    2.147664631128366
by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations;    2.2197806575273087
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other    1.8576191881490822
parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian    2.403321246818875
nationalism feeds".   Mr& Nixon, for his part, would oppose    2.1727476247429323
intervention in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend    2.0610114144924063
that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries    2.177141143311823
shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.   2.6982288431977053
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories    2.34538049615178
in Laos,    1.554585013127815
almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended    2.237787963708064
a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by    2.3010306576159176
Mr& Nixon and the professors.    1.8685246846249246
#AID PLANS REVAMPED#   1.3433503337309898
Very early    1.3051841577956294
in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels,    2.6708113193743896
a high official source disclosed, that the new administration    2.846127401628426
would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during    2.135743668584032
the formative period of the administration.   Strenuous efforts    2.0745199056126546
were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements. Policies    2.0156055017376993
on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But    1.8376200822147282
thus far there has been no response in kind.   Foreign aid programs    2.2947789766298614
were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to    2.1821770896509345
encourage political reform in recipient nations.   In Laos, the    1.846311365583682
administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show    2.2399149140767833
determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters    1.8299158720557829
as a useless gesture.   Again and again it asked the Communists    2.970849267606922
to "freeze" the military situation in Laos. But the Communists    2.228958868486895
aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.   And after several    2.1123270015110593
correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the    1.792234614465403
huge build-up,    1.1015261094588145
administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a    1.8074639756936566
"great service" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty    2.2192979989434307
Organization.   ~SEATO was steamed up and prepared    1.8168178813864724
contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos. But    2.153452741881241
the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for    2.5123365253325747
the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.    2.7938650855507055
(Some ~SEATO nations disagreed, however.)   There    1.6346689682864775
was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded    2.670434546455122
that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined    2.443621544620081
neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.   The administration    1.7676334045965412
declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos. The pro-Western    2.3076897508930503
government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against    2.7336346594913925
the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did appear    1.7758891269558605
to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.   There    2.0684471145602012
certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United    2.404193194077202
States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.   2.350002958078597
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an    3.147869021037898
acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was    1.9400038405558433
too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.   1.8635737567097497
One factor was the statement of Senator J& W& Fulbright (~D)    2.0803130958892857
of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.    2.4835880388145215
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a    6.760380329717341
year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal" of Prince Souvanna.    2.629186013719857
_WASHINGTON_ The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check    51.560166532954696
the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.   2.158128343456275
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect    2.7894363522468533
upon the "vitality of the nation".   In an important assertion    2.9261703743660705
of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive    2.5970461487447682
order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency    1.8513758660856774
and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory    2.064211197568321
Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.   The    1.9522585780808297
President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts    2.430297541004401
through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to    2.5927645348805406
states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.    1.8826110263117406
#OFFENSES MULTIPLY#   1.2008197428261533
The President has also called upon the Attorney    2.6365213383531896
General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and    2.473537184690459
the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development    2.940200250954311
of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local    3.509034985258136
communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.   Simultaneously    2.5254924942228207
the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L&    2.7059673437053027
Hackett, a special assistant ot the Attorney General, as executive    2.121655477987756
director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth    2.9458086140827486
Crime.   His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the    2.2823353888653553
fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since    2.164135129160446
1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.   Among arrests    2.6530327984146003
reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about    4.3389427661379525
half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.   4.6828011047823646
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin    2.0477238997088536
by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H& Hawksley, the    1.9387771441199626
present city ~CD head, believes.   Mr& Hawksley said yesterday    2.0261217720378
he would be willing to go before the city council "or anyone    2.8718344099524935
else locally" to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.   2.1391733865684555
East Providence now has no civil defense program. Mr& Hawksley,    2.052545595951021
the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time ~CD    2.5382849890969204
director in the city for the last nine years. He is not interested in    3.4698502959015785
being named a full-time director.   Noting that President Kennedy    2.111582599526438
has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for    2.1216453069033583
the nation's civil defense program, Mr& Hawksley said the federal    2.308599033762442
government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.   2.5238737770346806
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a ~CD director    2.088183407409672
for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount    4.22491531559682
on    1.0
a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.   Mr& Hawksley    1.852036905397488
said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents    3.111743362493267
who would be willing to take the full-time ~CD job. One of these    3.080794071257244
men is former Fire Chief John A& Laughlin, he said.   Along    2.0650977535358934
with a director, the city should provide a ~CD headquarters so    2.8018992510982406
that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.    2.2117749323822684
Mr& Hawksley said.   One advantage that would come to    2.297085252428276
the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence    3.1295733236936507
would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial    2.4070135976765266
aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense    2.310569361733901
program.   Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of    2.220570121468087
such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.   Mr&    1.934314938948356
Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue    2.1427507678153
trucks, similar to the ~CD vehicle obtained several years ago and    2.304884763941202
now detailed to the Central Fire Station.   He would assign    2.1102127607084236
one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the    3.847288032843518
other to the Rumford area.   Speaking of the present status of    2.645020117642242
civil defense in the city, Mr& Hawksley said he would be willing    3.424810470413235
to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to    2.8386288067494236
do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.   The Narragansett    2.4032055614783916
Race Track grounds is one assembly point, he said, and a drive-in    2.5233313899446284
theater in Seekonk would be another. Riverside residents would    1.9382804998511098
go to the Seekonk assembly point.   Mr& Hawksley said he was    2.4305673200068654
not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to    2.1583186181633565
assemble in case of an air attack.   Such vital information, he    2.262777949737719
said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular    3.469330151012735
intervals for residents to know.   If the city council fails to    2.5276939111265593
consider appointment of a full-time ~CD director, Mr& Hawksley    2.13819537748372
said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a    2.63402912650147
civil defense organization will be developed locally.   One of    2.2531535123904445
the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in    3.536625346494353
first aid. Other steps would be developed after information drifts down    2.079832815658859
to the local level from the federal government.   4.1152928298366405
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible    2.6995687397462063
revisions in mind.   Governor Notte said last night he    2.056361943912684
plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations    2.967328097160494
for possible changes in time for the next session of the General    2.9149754558306307
Assembly.   The governor's move into the so-called "blue    2.211896892047511
law" controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R&    2.7235602247217683
Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy was released to    2.0366646699362265
the press.   Mr& Notte was responding to a resolution adopted    2.1249638403034337
by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state    6.114125045425035
house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges the governor to have a    2.5248178112874062
complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision    2.5771587928896476
at the next session of the legislature.   While the city    3.7062331886228366
council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review,    2.05769706220405
Mr& Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty&    2.612687286943914
Gen& J& Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views".    2.787004085977123
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr& Nugent's    2.3181435822682914
cooperation, the governor said.   "I would expect the proposed    2.1252366108905276
committee to hold public hearings", Mr& Notte said, "to obtain    2.167078543676831
the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest    2.5876953851230096
groups affected by these laws".   The governor wrote    2.018726549304479
Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "with the continuous    3.228654030715016
problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers    2.1452262961036848
as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales".   The    2.8956775575679443
attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce    2.677588441648519
the blue laws. Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has    2.2034113716301675
said, the state police will step into the situation.   There    2.73857065913217
has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in    2.8729802570189498
Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales    2.36383425780274
laws. The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island    2.2396887632053737
and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit    2.0730227967151147
the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.   The    2.2107346995403887
Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more    1.9567037208546876
foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery    2.247176802650656
and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.   The only    2.144450887393708
day they "have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on    2.71527597321044
Sunday", the council's resolution said. The small shops "must    2.022213470275728
be retained, for they provide essential service to the community",    2.2984137302452416
according to the resolution, which added that they "also are the source    3.292587896186374
of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares that    1.84669451480394
Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue" to the local government.   2.1794210909202953
The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets,    2.1836345561537764
factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business"    1.8259450140078877
on Sunday. They "operate on a volume basis", it was contended,    2.090649521127864
"and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital    2.7068624228059615
shopping needs of the community".   2.1808777022222916
Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic and    1.932084028328981
Republican- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties,    1.8428265319565127
George H& Reama, nationally known labor-management expert, said    1.7407047190923821
here yesterday.   Mr& Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence    2.00713866590236
at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about    2.238919526801111
half of the people in the country want the "welfare" type of government    3.9394632400470373
and the other half want a free enterprise system. He suggested    3.5193885939709557
that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull    2.455739272693477
at the right lever for him on election day.   He said he was "confessing    3.920216847526586
that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910".    3.5068597274725173
That, he added, was when he was "a very young man, a machinist and    3.5129871964815447
toolmaker by trade.   "That was before I studied law. Some    2.1523487501030716
of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist    2.3759027824182986
Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist    2.153361078538479
track. He steered me to the right track- the free enterprise track".   2.713897589512871
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party    6.1644966716603715
called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of    2.28750108911533
all resources. He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever    2.059308623765017
gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to    2.540067576233116
pass under both major parties.   Mr& Reama, who retired as vice    2.0333696948053155
president of the American Screw Co& in 1955 said, "Both parties    11.06755623190162
in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth    3.791877018211114
in the gross national product- but neither told us how to achieve it".   3.165644185883594
He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but manufacturers    2.4299096906413076
are caught in a profit squeeze"- and raises should only    1.9526748420311357
come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.   2.4195875970385194
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy,    5.068512580530426
Mr& Reama said: "A Socialist is a person who believes    2.2764250547917926
in dividing everything he does not own". Mr& Reama, far from    2.3826985693309592
really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.   2.000780516963419
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston    2.9043225989003902
taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped    2.5674633457103417
will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.   3.011887613633901
William A& Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group    2.8780027186887507
of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right    2.2791501341624363
hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council    2.4582296837526414
President Raymond Fortin Sr&.   The law which governs    1.8147297113551433
home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the    2.5355792311430627
chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures    2.746612849611535
within 10 days and Mr& Martinelli happens to hold that post.   3.049281113682331
Mr& Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough    2.4688876367833505
signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter    2.460537596146279
and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70    2.661308096944891
days. He explained that by law the council must establish procedures    2.1665002607378536
for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers    5.7438141859672625
completes its work.   A difference of opinion arose between Mr&    2.1720615999521082
Martinelli and John P& Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact    2.1216331845580996
manner in which the vote is handled. Mr& Martinelli has, in recent    2.5731903190059358
weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called    2.5065817248305207
for the vote, while Mr& Bourcier said that a special election    3.4878489473633194
might be called instead.   Mr& Bourcier said that he had consulted    2.8883499149859135
several Superior Court justices in the last week and received    2.620060441705409
opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr& Martinelli and    1.847672199203591
the council that he would study the correct method and report back to    2.9039347963209767
the council as soon as possible.   Mr& Martinelli said yesterday    2.5176626242410496
that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to    6.755269289177625
plan further strategy in the charter movement. He said that the group    2.973738249235907
has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but    2.586317453917166
that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.   2.8899541048367685
"After inspiring this, I think we should certainly follow through    2.208012059554691
on it", he declared. "It has become our responsibility and I    2.5641832260480126
hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement".    2.331342863409324
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members    5.478620250178328
of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan    3.5154551016161917
ballot for posts on the charter commission.   "Our most immediate    2.0980841194113404
goal is to increase public awareness of the movement", he indicated,    2.3759275051975313
"and to tell them what this will mean for the town". He expects    3.14715767886914
that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled    2.6389721159215163
during the last week in September.   Some opposition to the home    3.378788310941057
rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the    2.2739059520769787
town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home    1.8734227189436823
rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.    2.2218310527765994
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.   2.4530615641867723
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter    2.4061689783302684
was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain    2.4814999988089133
signatures under what were termed "false pretenses". Several signers    1.7576499946554944
affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax    2.261863010461444
increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly    2.827612295560011
and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town    3.5459561403660973
take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.   1.993956924786882
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty    2.2163901520389024
to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may    2.185102514226905
be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.   2.1597687288515646
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday    1.5257213306659019
he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A&    2.268866213727286
Abatuno to draft the ordinance.   At the last session of the    2.0596473297960873
General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance    2.202197386275263
as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.    2.8950636550229074
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.   2.5597967697814488
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District    2.679738697717755
Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated to prosecute them    1.8819981885552732
because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.    2.8848266690890902
_PLAINFIELD_- James P& Mitchell and Sen& Walter H& Jones    52.34776502796524
~R-Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign    2.4194277314553756
issue a remark by Richard J& Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial    1.8619784882962571
candidate, that the ~GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass    2.206210389061805
of Eisenhower Republicanism".   Mitchell was for using it, Jones    1.9279760556697858
against, and Sen& Wayne Dumont Jr& ~R-Warren did not    1.8514427194457281
mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke    2.2117858786836244
at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel.    5.9219381749825555
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield    2.08478609487868
Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains    1.9226086929834438
Country Club. It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in    3.193610425845492
Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.   2.5413429208618106
Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention of    3.0856630517464465
the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower    2.8277713366777237
Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood    2.025417831472459
congealed after Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican    1.8799563185145824
Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the    2.903124042871667
people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We can love Eisenhower    2.7881794930680246
the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president **h but    2.495696333263814
there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership".   3.596003145367242
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue    2.338594512784921
in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can a man with any degree    3.8177599371851074
of common decency charge this"? he asked. The former secretary    2.119468975261816
