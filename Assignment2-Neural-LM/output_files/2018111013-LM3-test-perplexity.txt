feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.    1.6065767145351917
But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined    1.7269387314284994
by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment. In such a case    1.67495327387791
the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied    1.7026049541338664
to the issue by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism    1.6432600607208703
only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the    1.6432600607208703
Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout at Eichmann though he might,    1.5636360329510388
the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying    1.5636360329510388
the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally    1.748515906000203
recognized category of anti-Semitism. Yes, he believed that the    1.5127085093302464
Jews were "enemies of the Reich", and such a belief is, of course,    1.67495327387791
typical of "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the    1.5127085093302464
Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member    1.6065767145351917
of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The real question was    1.67495327387791
how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer    1.67495327387791
to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In    1.6432600607208703
regard to Eichmann,    1.0
it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained    1.6065767145351917
a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a    1.5636360329510388
principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent.    1.6432600607208703
Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could,    1.5636360329510388
as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the    1.4513752902486308
Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear of disobeying orders,    1.6432600607208703
as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness    1.6065767145351917
that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained    1.5636360329510388
in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's    1.6432600607208703
victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical    1.5127085093302464
rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous    1.67495327387791
the better, "Well, let's try it". At any rate, the substance    1.6065767145351917
of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from    1.5636360329510388
his membership in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor    1.6432600607208703
did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success    1.6432600607208703
on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to    1.6065767145351917
BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special    1.5127085093302464
Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened    1.7269387314284994
to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary    1.6065767145351917
anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany    1.6065767145351917
and wherever else they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial    1.6432600607208703
in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis    1.6065767145351917
to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the    1.67495327387791
activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified    1.5127085093302464
by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites    1.6432600607208703
in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary?    1.5127085093302464
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January    1.5127085093302464
1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death    1.6432600607208703
the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was    1.6065767145351917
attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including    1.6065767145351917
the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in    1.5636360329510388
charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the    1.6432600607208703
Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The measures for annihilation    1.5127085093302464
proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation,    1.5127085093302464
civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening the Conference,    1.5127085093302464
followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order    1.5636360329510388
issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as    1.5636360329510388
" a complement to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews    1.5127085093302464
from German living space through violence, economic strangulation,    1.4513752902486308
forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words, the promulgators    1.5127085093302464
of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews    1.6065767145351917
was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating    1.5636360329510388
in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on    1.67495327387791
the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as    1.5636360329510388
a readiness for murder. This, in fact, it turned out to be. Since    1.67495327387791
the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had    1.6432600607208703
began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions,    1.5127085093302464
and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their    1.5127085093302464
tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes; whether    1.5127085093302464
in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.   1.7269387314284994
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn    1.6065767145351917
the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the    1.5636360329510388
exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp    1.5127085093302464
brute? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism    1.5127085093302464
of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning    1.6065767145351917
of the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had    1.7026049541338664
conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent" dislike of Jews,    1.5127085093302464
as do others like them today. The Final Solution proved that the    1.6432600607208703
Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the    1.6065767145351917
criminality and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial have    1.6065767145351917
made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how    1.67495327387791
representative types of "mere" anti-Semites were drawn step by    1.5127085093302464
step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor    1.5636360329510388
in his opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism"    1.6065767145351917
among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed". But    1.5127085093302464
if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's    1.6065767145351917
head    1.0
at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press    1.6065767145351917
NOR DID THE Trial devote much    1.2818970554302986
attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis,    1.5636360329510388
both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations    1.67495327387791
and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the    1.6065767145351917
world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous    1.6065767145351917
weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew    1.67495327387791
can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society    1.6065767145351917
into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know    1.6065767145351917
enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in    1.67495327387791
the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting    1.5127085093302464
apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest    1.5636360329510388
impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally    1.4513752902486308
forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them    1.6432600607208703
partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial    1.6065767145351917
a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful    1.3761581156320553
of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform;    1.67495327387791
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of    1.6432600607208703
politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent    1.6065767145351917
to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania    1.6065767145351917
and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you    1.67495327387791
desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this    1.6065767145351917
characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor,    1.5127085093302464
more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a    1.6432600607208703
political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission    1.6065767145351917
of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed    1.6432600607208703
to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which    1.67495327387791
the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&,    1.5127085093302464
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it    1.5127085093302464
met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria,    1.5636360329510388
France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an    1.6065767145351917
outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism    1.6065767145351917
proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose    1.6432600607208703
citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't    1.5127085093302464
this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries    1.4513752902486308
worth highlighting?    1.0
AS THE FIRST collective confrontation    1.1606783668269585
of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery    1.6065767145351917
of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen    1.7269387314284994
years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one    1.67495327387791
believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance    1.6432600607208703
of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to    1.6432600607208703
recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to    1.7026049541338664
the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were    1.7026049541338664
unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had    1.5127085093302464
been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and    1.6432600607208703
investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors'    1.4513752902486308
accounts.    1.0
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital    1.5636360329510388
presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the    1.5636360329510388
Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff.    1.5636360329510388
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of    1.6432600607208703
protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace    1.6065767145351917
of the community    1.0
was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the    1.6065767145351917
incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's    1.6065767145351917
Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide    1.5636360329510388
a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated    1.5636360329510388
a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman    1.4513752902486308
Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board    1.5636360329510388
of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year    1.5636360329510388
later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an    1.6065767145351917
orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood    1.5636360329510388
Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were    1.5127085093302464
embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's    1.6432600607208703
right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents,    1.5636360329510388
typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no    1.5636360329510388
controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension,    1.5636360329510388
rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control    1.6432600607208703
issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of    1.6065767145351917
newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in    1.4513752902486308
municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted    1.5636360329510388
on the national level in the matter of including birth-control    1.5636360329510388
information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where    1.5636360329510388
it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment    1.6432600607208703
like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The    1.5636360329510388
time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove    1.7269387314284994
this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life    1.6065767145351917
of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment    1.6432600607208703
of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication    1.6065767145351917
on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination,    1.5636360329510388
loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study    1.5127085093302464
of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more    1.67495327387791
serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is    1.6432600607208703
reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara,    1.4513752902486308
managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over    1.4513752902486308
Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the    1.5636360329510388
reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their    1.5127085093302464
jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed    1.6432600607208703
in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly    1.5636360329510388
harsh.   1.0
The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-    1.5127085093302464
frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-    1.4513752902486308
already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the    1.4513752902486308
over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being    1.5127085093302464
obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number    1.5636360329510388
of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible>    1.5636360329510388
parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents    1.5636360329510388
will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope    1.5636360329510388
Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from    1.67495327387791
the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the    1.67495327387791
whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as    1.6432600607208703
those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and    1.5636360329510388
social "indications". This means that such factors as the health    1.5636360329510388
of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their    1.6065767145351917
children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density    1.6065767145351917
of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately    1.6065767145351917
be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.   1.5636360329510388
These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics    1.5127085093302464
in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control    1.6065767145351917
only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however,    1.5127085093302464
sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics,    1.5636360329510388
Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of    1.5636360329510388
family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman    1.6432600607208703
Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also    1.5636360329510388
known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers    1.67495327387791
this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author:    1.6432600607208703
It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent    1.6065767145351917
and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman    1.6065767145351917
Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no    1.5636360329510388
moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives,    1.5127085093302464
allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in    1.5636360329510388
theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The    1.5636360329510388
grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament),    1.5127085093302464
the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the    1.6432600607208703
unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest    1.5636360329510388
ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent    1.6065767145351917
role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive,    1.5127085093302464
entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of    1.5636360329510388
birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition    1.3761581156320553
regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of    1.5127085093302464
the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual    1.6432600607208703
love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion    1.6432600607208703
is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason    1.67495327387791
can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known    1.6432600607208703
His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus,    1.4513752902486308
man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal    1.6432600607208703
act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man    1.5636360329510388
may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by    1.5636360329510388
God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for    1.67495327387791
the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this    1.6432600607208703
law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are    1.67495327387791
obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let    1.6065767145351917
it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between    1.6432600607208703
Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But    1.5127085093302464
people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without    1.6065767145351917
taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it    1.6432600607208703
so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has    1.67495327387791
sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation    1.5127085093302464
and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical    1.6065767145351917
consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation    1.5127085093302464
for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant    1.5127085093302464
one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint    1.67495327387791
upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed    1.5127085093302464
to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during    1.5636360329510388
World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the    1.6065767145351917
Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe    1.5127085093302464
that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically    1.7026049541338664
evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants    1.67495327387791
forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general    1.4513752902486308
public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that    1.6432600607208703
the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt    1.67495327387791
to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers,    1.6065767145351917
hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled    1.6065767145351917
in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an    1.5636360329510388
inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience    1.4513752902486308
shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced    1.6432600607208703
when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.    1.6065767145351917
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control    1.67495327387791
today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned    1.6065767145351917
by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary    1.5127085093302464
to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian    1.67495327387791
countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches    1.4513752902486308
stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth    1.5636360329510388
Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual    1.4513752902486308
change that has taken place among Protestants generally.    1.4513752902486308
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception    1.6065767145351917
and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural    1.5636360329510388
means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers-    1.6065767145351917
physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against    1.4513752902486308
the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing    1.6432600607208703
the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference    1.67495327387791
declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded    1.5127085093302464
as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the    1.5636360329510388
primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance    1.5127085093302464
of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is    1.67495327387791
the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful    1.5636360329510388
self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against    1.5127085093302464
the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth    1.6065767145351917
Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be    1.5636360329510388
the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances,    1.6065767145351917
contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958,    1.3761581156320553
the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by    1.5636360329510388
God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations    1.4513752902486308
preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out    1.6065767145351917
of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified    1.67495327387791
artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity",    1.5127085093302464
the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the    1.6065767145351917
size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control    1.67495327387791
of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement    1.6432600607208703
also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression    1.6065767145351917
of mutual affection <without> relation to procreation is right".   1.5127085093302464
Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate    1.4513752902486308
pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared    1.6065767145351917
it at times to be a <religious duty>. What determines the morality,    1.6432600607208703
they state, is not the <means> used, but the <motive>. In    1.6065767145351917
general, the means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective are    1.5636360329510388
considered the most ethical.   This development is reflected in    1.5127085093302464
the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the    1.6432600607208703
National    1.0
Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the    1.5127085093302464
~US. The board approved and commended the use of birth-control    1.5636360329510388
devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning. It    1.6065767145351917
called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting    1.5127085093302464
the information or availability of contraceptives.   The general    1.4513752902486308
board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception    1.5127085093302464
and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are    1.6065767145351917
right **h. The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather    1.5636360329510388
than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are    1.6065767145351917
limited to the prevention of conception".   An action once universally    1.5636360329510388
condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil    1.5636360329510388
law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant    1.6432600607208703
denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive    1.6065767145351917
<religious duty>. This viewpoint has now been translated into    1.5127085093302464
action by the majority of people in this country. Repeated polls have    1.6432600607208703
disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the    1.6065767145351917
practice of birth control.   For all concerned with social-welfare    1.5127085093302464
legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary    1.4513752902486308
change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American    1.67495327387791
people is clear, profound and far-reaching. To try to oppose the general    1.6432600607208703
religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative    1.6065767145351917
fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was    1.7026049541338664
occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.   This brings    1.4513752902486308
us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in    1.7026049541338664
the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion:    1.67495327387791
They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.    1.5127085093302464
Conscience and religion are concerned with private <sin:> The civil    1.5636360329510388
law is concerned with public <crimes>. Only confusion, failure    1.5127085093302464
and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority    1.7026049541338664
the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the    1.5636360329510388
possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived    1.6065767145351917
imposition would be religion itself.    1.1606783668269585
On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, <Discovery>,    1.5636360329510388
weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool, London, and    1.4513752902486308
floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain,    1.6432600607208703
a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration    1.6065767145351917
of the Arctic waters of North America.   Seventeen months later,    1.5636360329510388
on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the <Discovery>    1.6065767145351917
limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port,    1.5127085093302464
she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The    1.7026049541338664
captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded    1.67495327387791
her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.   What disaster    1.6065767145351917
struck the <Discovery> during those seventeen months? What happened    1.5127085093302464
to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained    1.5127085093302464
one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the    1.7026049541338664
evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal,    1.5127085093302464
(2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note    1.67495327387791
found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand    1.6432600607208703
reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture.   But    1.5636360329510388
since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal    1.5636360329510388
files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not    1.6065767145351917
enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate    1.7026049541338664
picture of the events of the voyage.   Historians have had    1.5636360329510388
two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First,    1.5636360329510388
they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed    1.6065767145351917
it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose    1.6432600607208703
name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties,    1.6432600607208703
on a great American river, and on half a million square miles    1.6432600607208703
of Arctic seas.   The name: <Henry Hudson>.   This    1.4513752902486308
is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or    1.7269387314284994
ever, probably, will be able- to determine:   The sailing in    1.5636360329510388
the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time    1.6432600607208703
his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western    1.6432600607208703
Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy    1.6432600607208703
Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole    1.7026049541338664
or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy    1.67495327387791
Company indicated it would not back him again.   In 1609, the    1.6065767145351917
Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers,    1.6065767145351917
fitted him out with a ship called the <Half Moon>, and supplied    1.6432600607208703
him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the    1.6065767145351917
middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important-    1.6065767145351917
the Great North (later, the Hudson) River- but it produced    1.5636360329510388
When the <Half Moon> put in at    1.3761581156320553
Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings    1.6065767145351917
leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government    1.5636360329510388
forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went    1.6432600607208703
to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime,    1.67495327387791
he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage    1.6065767145351917
of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran    1.6432600607208703
ship called the <Discovery> and had recruited a crew of twenty-one,    1.6065767145351917
the largest he had ever commanded.   The purpose of this    1.5636360329510388
fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that    1.6065767145351917
a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe    1.6065767145351917
and    1.0
the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a    1.67495327387791
passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's    1.5636360329510388
sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.   1.7026049541338664
But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to    1.5127085093302464
the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had    1.5636360329510388
noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the    1.67495327387791
water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He    1.6432600607208703
named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious    1.5636360329510388
Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)   1.5127085093302464
In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little <Discovery> that    1.5636360329510388
Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his    1.6432600607208703
frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all    1.6432600607208703
the    1.0
way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.   1.6065767145351917
Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he    1.5636360329510388
was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous,    1.7026049541338664
ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely    1.5636360329510388
such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.    1.6432600607208703
On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of    1.67495327387791
Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that    1.6065767145351917
he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case. On    1.7269387314284994
the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch    1.6065767145351917
and English crew members on the <Half Moon> had almost forced him    1.6432600607208703
to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.   Worse,    1.5636360329510388
his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before. Of    1.67495327387791
only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son. The    1.67495327387791
mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the <half Moon>,    1.6432600607208703
was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or    1.67495327387791
desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was    1.5636360329510388
a good worker, but perversely independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael    1.5636360329510388
Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson    1.6065767145351917
in a crisis.   But men willing to sail at all into waters where    1.67495327387791
wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find. Hudson    1.6432600607208703
knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer. And    1.7269387314284994
he refused to be anything else.   It is believed that Hudson    1.6065767145351917
was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was    1.6432600607208703
trained    1.0
on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with three sons.    1.6065767145351917
(The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name    1.6432600607208703
was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.) In 1610,    1.6432600607208703
Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn    1.6432600607208703
voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.    1.5127085093302464
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a    1.5636360329510388
few miles down the Thames. There at the river's edge waited one Henry    1.67495327387791
Greene, whom Hudson listed as a "clerk". Greene was in actuality    1.6065767145351917
a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in    1.6432600607208703
order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores.    1.6065767145351917
He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board    1.7269387314284994
and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the <Discovery> picked    1.6065767145351917
him up.   For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the    1.6432600607208703
east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward. On May 11, she    1.6432600607208703
reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the    1.67495327387791
crew called "Lousie Bay". The subsequent two-weeks wait made the    1.5636360329510388
crew quarrelsome. With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked    1.5636360329510388
a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue was    1.6065767145351917
settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined    1.5636360329510388
to catch the next fishing boat back to England. With difficulty,    1.6065767145351917
Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.    1.6432600607208703
Early in June, the <Discovery> passed "Desolation"    1.3761581156320553
(southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall".    1.5127085093302464
Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog hung    1.6065767145351917
over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.    1.6432600607208703
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic    1.6432600607208703
North Pole.   As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was    1.5127085093302464
forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the    1.7026049541338664
great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he    1.6065767145351917
turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the    1.5636360329510388
crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.   The trouble    1.5127085093302464
was at least partly Juet's doing. For weeks he had been saying that    1.67495327387791
Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd. The great,    1.6065767145351917
crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice    1.6432600607208703
of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would    1.67495327387791
sail no farther.   Instead of quelling the dissension, as many    1.5636360329510388
captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's    1.67495327387791
head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable.    1.5636360329510388
He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which    1.6432600607208703
he set up in view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew    1.7026049541338664
about their course and their objectives.   When Hudson had finished,    1.5636360329510388
the "town meeting" broke down into a general, wordy    1.5127085093302464
argument.    1.0
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety    1.7026049541338664
of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who    1.6432600607208703
said he wouldn't give <ten> pounds to be home. The statement was    1.6432600607208703
All through July the <Discovery> picked her way along the 450-mile-long    1.6065767145351917
strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands. On August 3, two massive    1.6065767145351917
headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before,    1.5636360329510388
so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape    1.67495327387791
a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands    1.6432600607208703
of screaming sea birds. To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind    1.7026049541338664
to a precipice of 2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and    1.6432600607208703
Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.   Hudson pointed the <Discovery>    1.5636360329510388
down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called    1.6065767145351917
Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the    1.7026049541338664
Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered    1.5636360329510388
an area of shallow marshes and river deltas. The ship halted. The    1.6432600607208703
great "sea to the westwards" was a dead end.   This must have    1.6432600607208703
been Hudson's blackest discovery. For he seemed to sense at once    1.6065767145351917
that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North    1.7026049541338664
American continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to    1.6065767145351917
know he was destined to failure.   Feverishly, he tried to brush    1.6065767145351917
away this intuition. North and south, east and west, back and forth    1.6432600607208703
he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land    1.6065767145351917
appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after    1.6432600607208703
week. Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England    1.6432600607208703
through the "Furious Overfall" was again filling with ice.   1.5127085093302464
The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking.    1.6432600607208703
Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest. Hudson's reply    1.5127085093302464
was to accuse the mate of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove    1.6432600607208703
his charges in an open trial.   The trial was held September    1.6065767145351917
10. Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony    1.5636360329510388
from crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men    1.5636360329510388
stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe    1.5636360329510388
swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords    1.67495327387791
in their cabins. Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted    1.5636360329510388
bloodshed on the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the    1.67495327387791
ship homeward.   Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new    1.6065767145351917
mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There were other    1.5636360329510388
shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.    1.6432600607208703
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis    1.5127085093302464
Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.   1.4513752902486308
As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little    1.5127085093302464
bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him. Once,    1.5636360329510388
after the <Discovery> lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered    1.6432600607208703
the anchor raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being    1.67495327387791
hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and Adame Moore    1.6432600607208703
were thrown off the capstan and badly injured. The anchor cable would    1.6432600607208703
have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever    1.6432600607208703
it with his axe.   1.0
Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian    1.5127085093302464
Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands,    1.6432600607208703
conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River    1.67495327387791
of the North. Since the land he desired lay within the great northern    1.67495327387791
empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of    1.6065767145351917
the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies. Having    1.6065767145351917
achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the    1.67495327387791
valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched    1.6065767145351917
southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red- was    1.5636360329510388
made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots    1.7269387314284994
was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus    1.6432600607208703
at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify    1.6432600607208703
the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle    1.6065767145351917
of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the    1.5636360329510388
center of the North American continent to the west of the American    1.6432600607208703
agricultural frontier.   Seven hundred miles south of York Factory,    1.5127085093302464
at "the Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three    1.5636360329510388
men located a settlement in August 1812. By October the little    1.6065767145351917
colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg) numbered 100. Within    1.5127085093302464
a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring    1.67495327387791
the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called <Meurons>.    1.67495327387791
The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported    1.5636360329510388
by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the    1.6065767145351917
War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of    1.67495327387791
the war in 1815. Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go    1.67495327387791
to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect    1.7026049541338664
his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the    1.5636360329510388
intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries    1.5636360329510388
were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of    1.6432600607208703
the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as    1.7269387314284994
1818.   It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages    1.67495327387791
of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement    1.6432600607208703
southward. When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was    1.67495327387791
assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and <metis> moved up    1.6432600607208703
the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built huts and    1.7026049541338664
a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland.    1.5636360329510388
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer    1.6432600607208703
to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for    1.67495327387791
food.   The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move    1.5636360329510388
southward by British fur traders. For many years the Northwest Company    1.6065767145351917
had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi    1.6065767145351917
River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul,    1.5127085093302464
Minnesota. When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm    1.6432600607208703
out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American    1.6065767145351917
citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly-    1.4513752902486308
continued in the fur business. On Big Stone Lake near the    1.6065767145351917
headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of    1.5127085093302464
the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned    1.6432600607208703
in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small    1.7269387314284994
artillery pieces. His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks    1.6065767145351917
of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south    1.6065767145351917
in carts. These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days    1.7026049541338664
of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk    1.6065767145351917
colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new carts" as    1.6432600607208703
being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as    1.7026049541338664
a horse could pack. They were held together by pegs and withes and    1.67495327387791
in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.   It was Dickson    1.67495327387791
who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast    1.6432600607208703
by way of the United States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina)    1.67495327387791
Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux,    1.7026049541338664
he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the trip Selkirk decided    1.6065767145351917
that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern    1.6065767145351917
United States was the best route for goods from England to reach    1.6432600607208703
Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply    1.67495327387791
for many goods than either Canada or England. Upon arriving at    1.6065767145351917
Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams,    1.5636360329510388
Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade    1.5636360329510388
with "Missouri and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he    1.4513752902486308
declared prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at first,    1.6065767145351917
would increase with the progress of our Settlements **h".    1.5127085093302464
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop    1.6432600607208703
into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might    1.67495327387791
have expected. In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the    1.6065767145351917
Forks" (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort    1.6065767145351917
Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien.    1.6065767145351917
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three    1.67495327387791
months of labor on Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice    1.6065767145351917
gone from the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river)    1.5127085093302464
their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels    1.7026049541338664
of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats    1.6065767145351917
and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse,    1.67495327387791
and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820. This    1.6432600607208703
epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk @1,040.    1.6065767145351917
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were    1.6432600607208703
forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became    1.67495327387791
more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.   1.6432600607208703
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony    1.5636360329510388
on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send    1.67495327387791
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post    1.5127085093302464
300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien, until then the most advanced    1.6432600607208703
United States post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry    1.5636360329510388
arrived at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of navigation    1.67495327387791
on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St&    1.5127085093302464
Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander,    1.6065767145351917
Colonel Josiah Snelling.   It was from the American outposts    1.5127085093302464
that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules    1.6432600607208703
L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted    1.6065767145351917
to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and    1.6065767145351917
Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers. Bailly,    1.5636360329510388
after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave    1.6065767145351917
some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake    1.6432600607208703
Traverse "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the    1.6065767145351917
Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the    1.6065767145351917
fall. He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families    1.6432600607208703
of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward    1.5636360329510388
the United States. Observing their distressing condition, Colonel    1.4513752902486308
Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military    1.5636360329510388
reservation.   As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk    1.5127085093302464
settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman    1.5636360329510388
of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du Chien was traveling    1.5127085093302464
to Red River to open a trade in merchandise. Early in 1822 he was    1.7026049541338664
at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.    1.6432600607208703
Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird,    1.5127085093302464
a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such "sundry    1.6065767145351917
articles" to a value of @4,500.   For its part the Hudson's    1.6065767145351917
Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement.    1.5636360329510388
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier    1.6432600607208703
by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the    1.6432600607208703
Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer- was on American    1.6065767145351917
territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move    1.5127085093302464
north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating    1.6432600607208703
the timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything",    1.6065767145351917
he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment    1.6065767145351917
**h". Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut    1.5127085093302464
off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350    1.6432600607208703
persons stayed in the village. They would attempt to bring supplies    1.6065767145351917
from St& Louis or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well    1.6432600607208703
as danger".   At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided    1.6065767145351917
to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families    1.67495327387791
paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling. The disasters of 1825-1826    1.6432600607208703
caused more to leave. After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice,    1.6432600607208703
snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through    1.6432600607208703
a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick. In April    1.748515906000203
came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until    1.67495327387791
mid-June. On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month    1.6065767145351917
trip across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443 survivors    1.6065767145351917
of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but    1.5636360329510388
most of them were sent on to Galena and St& Louis, with a few going    1.7269387314284994
as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United    1.6432600607208703
States. In 1837, 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were    1.67495327387791
living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.   Below the fort,    1.5636360329510388
high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi    1.5636360329510388
River. At the point where they ended, another settlement grew    1.5636360329510388
up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier    1.67495327387791
in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American    1.5636360329510388
Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were    1.5636360329510388
joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major    1.6432600607208703
Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840.    1.5636360329510388
The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father    1.67495327387791
Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become an important center    1.5636360329510388
of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers    1.7269387314284994
who remained at Red River.   While population at Fort    1.5127085093302464
Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic    1.6432600607208703
opportunities did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though    1.5636360329510388
the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter    1.5636360329510388
which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the    1.6065767145351917
Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade. The Company    1.5636360329510388
maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased    1.6065767145351917
and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they    1.67495327387791
refrain from trading in furs. Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some    1.6065767145351917
of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs.    1.6432600607208703
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed    1.5636360329510388
a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed    1.67495327387791
as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power".    1.6432600607208703
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's    1.6065767145351917
local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding    1.5636360329510388
any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source    1.6065767145351917
of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men    1.6432600607208703
to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried    1.6065767145351917
pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St&    1.6065767145351917
Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells,    1.7026049541338664
transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This    1.5636360329510388
trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835,    1.67495327387791
but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty    1.6432600607208703
was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.   1.7269387314284994
The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow    1.6065767145351917
in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel.    1.7269387314284994
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer    1.67495327387791
humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in    1.67495327387791
the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some    1.7026049541338664
of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate    1.6065767145351917
observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen    1.6065767145351917
and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were    1.6065767145351917
"in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house".    1.67495327387791
A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".   1.67495327387791
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One    1.4513752902486308
wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse +    1.67495327387791
snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses    1.6065767145351917
in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times".    1.67495327387791
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved    1.5127085093302464
about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches    1.67495327387791
on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity    1.67495327387791
of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and    1.6065767145351917
sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following    1.6432600607208703
description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse    1.6065767145351917
girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h    1.6065767145351917
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from    1.6432600607208703
the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression.    1.6065767145351917
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become    1.6432600607208703
of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my    1.67495327387791
love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell,    1.6432600607208703
an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved    1.4513752902486308
in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked    1.5127085093302464
to    1.0
tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about    1.7026049541338664
a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive    1.67495327387791
letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married    1.67495327387791
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar    1.7026049541338664
as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as    1.7269387314284994
I am    1.0
so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote:    1.5636360329510388
"I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another    1.67495327387791
Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down    1.6065767145351917
to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite    1.6432600607208703
before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"".    1.6065767145351917
Charles    1.0
Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his    1.5636360329510388
comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation,    1.7026049541338664
well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like    1.67495327387791
his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his    1.67495327387791
service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups,    1.748515906000203
name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and    1.5636360329510388
then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and    1.67495327387791
'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file    1.5127085093302464
of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and    1.6432600607208703
wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most    1.67495327387791
common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities    1.6065767145351917
referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but    1.5636360329510388
a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier    1.6065767145351917
stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough    1.6065767145351917
as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs    1.7026049541338664
from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer    1.6065767145351917
to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering    1.6432600607208703
from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier    1.4513752902486308
gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence    1.6065767145351917
of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three    1.67495327387791
days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack    1.7026049541338664
and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother:    1.6065767145351917
"I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear    1.67495327387791
and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters    1.6432600607208703
which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances.    1.6065767145351917
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers    1.5636360329510388
rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of    1.6432600607208703
the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of    1.67495327387791
bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of    1.7026049541338664
the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many    1.67495327387791
Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing    1.5636360329510388
from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the    1.7026049541338664
sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously    1.7026049541338664
written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing    1.5127085093302464
about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863,    1.6065767145351917
stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced    1.67495327387791
writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we    1.6432600607208703
take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed    1.6432600607208703
his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often    1.6432600607208703
**h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just    1.7269387314284994
count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every    1.7269387314284994
time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta    1.5127085093302464
reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they    1.5636360329510388
The most    1.0
common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But    1.67495327387791
fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and    1.5127085093302464
these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing    1.6432600607208703
of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include    1.6065767145351917
in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro    1.6065767145351917
community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the    1.6065767145351917
war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro    1.67495327387791
"body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging,    1.6065767145351917
cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.    1.4513752902486308
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters    1.6065767145351917
of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members    1.5636360329510388
of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on    1.4513752902486308
correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages    1.5636360329510388
characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were    1.4513752902486308
stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally    1.4513752902486308
gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about    1.6432600607208703
their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or    1.4513752902486308
Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier    1.5636360329510388
whose    1.0
feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully    1.5636360329510388
of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout    1.5127085093302464
I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it    1.7026049541338664
all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five    1.7269387314284994
of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I    1.7026049541338664
recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they    1.748515906000203
would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk".    1.7026049541338664
Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who,    1.6065767145351917
from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment    1.6065767145351917
on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself    1.67495327387791
thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was    1.6432600607208703
a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having    1.7026049541338664
any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse **h.    1.748515906000203

helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as    1.7269387314284994
i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from    1.5127085093302464
soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions.    1.5127085093302464
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his    1.5636360329510388
first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting    1.6065767145351917
yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they    1.6432600607208703
brok + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches    1.67495327387791
and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit    1.7269387314284994
Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers    1.6432600607208703
in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi    1.6065767145351917
soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain,    1.5636360329510388
stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry    1.4513752902486308
is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation    1.5636360329510388
of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to    1.6432600607208703
tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H&    1.6432600607208703
Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees    1.5636360329510388
from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a    1.6432600607208703
private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton    1.6432600607208703
and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head    1.67495327387791
cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps    1.6432600607208703
**h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow    1.67495327387791
their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point    1.67495327387791
graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments    1.5636360329510388
about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.    1.6432600607208703
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War    1.6065767145351917
version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves    1.5127085093302464
as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks    1.67495327387791
**h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten    1.7269387314284994
cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George    1.5636360329510388
Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My    1.6065767145351917
own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended    1.7026049541338664
long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I    1.6065767145351917
wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging    1.7269387314284994
them against [the other half]".   No group of officers    1.5127085093302464
came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal    1.6065767145351917
soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde    1.67495327387791
with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after    1.6065767145351917
the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank    1.5127085093302464
wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital    1.6432600607208703
for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed-    1.5636360329510388
thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union    1.6432600607208703
quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward    1.5636360329510388
each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut    1.67495327387791
of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to    1.6065767145351917
a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey    1.6432600607208703
+ gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier    1.5127085093302464
wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw    1.7026049541338664
they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h".    1.67495327387791
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote    1.5636360329510388
in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right    1.6065767145351917
**h found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe    1.7026049541338664
their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise    1.5636360329510388
with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would    1.6432600607208703
be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing    1.67495327387791
from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama    1.6432600607208703
Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that    1.6065767145351917

THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION    1.5636360329510388
to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism    1.6432600607208703
in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence    1.6065767145351917
across the world. Thus, if we are to observe American folklore    1.6065767145351917
in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships    1.6432600607208703
between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.   1.4513752902486308
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism    1.5636360329510388
and international influence. 1) Every age rewrites the events    1.5127085093302464
of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends    1.6432600607208703
about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary    1.5127085093302464
actions. What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important    1.6065767145351917
as what a given generation feels must have occurred. 2) As a country    1.67495327387791
superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches    1.5636360329510388
its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness. Its folklore    1.5636360329510388
and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account    1.5636360329510388
for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to    1.67495327387791
become a cohesive force for national identification.   One can apply    1.5636360329510388
these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries    1.6065767145351917
as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be    1.67495327387791
applied again to the United States in more recent years. The popularity    1.6432600607208703
of local color literature before the Spanish-American War, the    1.5127085093302464
steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the    1.6065767145351917
frontier west in our mass media are cases in point. Nor is it an accident    1.7269387314284994
that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years,    1.6432600607208703
has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such    1.6065767145351917
as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical    1.5127085093302464
Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature,    1.6432600607208703
American civilization, American anything have swept our school    1.4513752902486308
and college curricula.   Of course, nationalism has really    1.4513752902486308
outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its    1.6432600607208703
continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the    1.6065767145351917
twentieth-century    1.0
United States. Yet nationalism has lost few of its    1.5127085093302464
charms for the historian, writer or man in the street. It is an understandable    1.7026049541338664
paradox that most American history and most American literature    1.5127085093302464
is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic    1.5127085093302464
point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion    1.6432600607208703
over palm and pine. After all, the average American as he lies and    1.67495327387791
waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain    1.7269387314284994
hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or    1.6432600607208703
her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental    1.67495327387791
actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.    1.5127085093302464
Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether    1.3761581156320553
warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense    1.4513752902486308
emotional involvement. Such identification comes for each group in each    1.5636360329510388
crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate    1.5127085093302464
national heroes.   In America, such self-deception has served    1.4513752902486308
a particularly useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed it    1.5636360329510388
to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and    1.67495327387791
ever-changing    1.0
land. But we must never forget, most of the appropriate    1.5636360329510388
heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs,    1.6065767145351917
almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson Weems's George    1.5636360329510388
Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of    1.6065767145351917
the uniting States. Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of    1.5636360329510388
the national Constitution. Robert E& Lee represented the dignity    1.5127085093302464
needed by a rebelling confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by    1.6065767145351917
those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett,    1.5636360329510388
Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.   Therefore, the    1.4513752902486308
scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years,    1.67495327387791
will be mindful of two facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created    1.7026049541338664
to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are    1.6065767145351917
not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that an "American national    1.6432600607208703
folklore" exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.   1.4513752902486308
Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group    1.5127085093302464
of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission. It    1.5636360329510388
has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions,    1.6065767145351917
rhymes and such literary forms of expression. Related to    1.5127085093302464
written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written    1.5127085093302464
form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral    1.6432600607208703
existence. Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies,    1.6065767145351917
it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.   1.6432600607208703
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our    1.5127085093302464
folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as    1.6065767145351917
this. Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus    1.4513752902486308
materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor    1.5636360329510388
union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition. Nor    1.6432600607208703
have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of    1.67495327387791
isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did    1.5127085093302464
not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education    1.6065767145351917
and industrialization    1.0
had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as    1.5127085093302464
a means of carrying culturally significant material.   Naturally,    1.4513752902486308
such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make    1.67495327387791
money or fan patriotism by means of folklore. That much of what he    1.67495327387791
calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people    1.6432600607208703
with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction    1.6065767145351917
to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant. As long    1.6432600607208703
as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses    1.7026049541338664
and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains satisfied.   1.5127085093302464
From all this we can now see that two streams of development    1.6432600607208703
run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore. On    1.5127085093302464
the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained    1.6432600607208703
in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected    1.5636360329510388
and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic,    1.6432600607208703
regional and occupational groups that make up this nation. On the other    1.6432600607208703
we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been    1.6065767145351917
willing to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial material    1.5636360329510388
willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists (writers, movie    1.4513752902486308
producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore    1.5127085093302464
since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams    1.6065767145351917
even in the most general of ways. After all, the field is large, difficult    1.7026049541338664
to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates.    1.5127085093302464
In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many    1.6432600607208703
heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of    1.6432600607208703
print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society.    1.5636360329510388
The problems confuse even the experts.   For that matter,    1.5127085093302464
the experts themselves are a mixed breed. Anthropologists, housewives,    1.5127085093302464
historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline    1.5127085093302464
as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination    1.5127085093302464
of the four. They have widely varying backgrounds and aims.    1.5636360329510388
They have little "esprit de corps".   The outlook for the    1.5636360329510388
amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local    1.6065767145351917
history or for the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism    1.6065767145351917
in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.    1.67495327387791
Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain    1.67495327387791
as such. The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is    1.6432600607208703
actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field. The collector    1.7026049541338664
enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the    1.6065767145351917
very "field and stream" reasons that many persons hunt game; and    1.6065767145351917
only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has    1.67495327387791
located. Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector,    1.5636360329510388
are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between    1.5636360329510388
real folklore and bogus material.   But there are also the commercial    1.6065767145351917
propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other    1.5636360329510388
by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are primarily concerned    1.4513752902486308
with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector    1.67495327387791
has found. Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond    1.6432600607208703
the sewage system and the electric light lines. The commercial propagandist,    1.6065767145351917
who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the    1.6065767145351917
amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's    1.6432600607208703
toes by refusing to keep his material genuine. His standards are,    1.6065767145351917
of course, completely foreign to those of the analyst. To both the amateur    1.67495327387791
and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation    1.6065767145351917
with his endless probings and classifications. Dominated by    1.4513752902486308
the vicious circle of the university promotion system, the analyst looks    1.6065767145351917
down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups, although    1.6432600607208703
he cannot deny his debt to the collector.   The knowledge that    1.6065767145351917
most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial    1.5636360329510388
propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors. The work    1.5636360329510388
done by the analysts, the men who really know what folklore is all about,    1.7026049541338664
has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort    1.67495327387791
and reaches a limited, learned audience. Publishers want books that    1.5636360329510388
will sell, recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to    1.6432600607208703
ears used to hillbilly and jazz music, grade and high schools want quaint,    1.67495327387791
but moral, material. The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit    1.67495327387791
in. As a result, most people don't have more than a vague idea what    1.7026049541338664
folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming, moral    1.6432600607208703
legends and patriotic anecdotes, with a superstition or remedy thrown    1.5636360329510388
in here and there. And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur    1.7026049541338664
and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the    1.6432600607208703
hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment    1.6065767145351917
and nationalism alone.   If one wishes to discuss a literary    1.5636360329510388
figure who uses folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize    1.67495327387791
is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American    1.6432600607208703
public. And while every writer must be dealt with as a special    1.6432600607208703
case, the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions    1.67495327387791
about each. Does the writer know the difference between an "ersatz"    1.6065767145351917
ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk? When    1.6432600607208703
the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial    1.67495327387791
effect or does he leave it pure? Is the writer propagandistic?    1.6065767145351917
Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was?    1.67495327387791
Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American    1.6432600607208703
attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they    1.5636360329510388
may be?   When he gets the answers to his questions he will be    1.67495327387791
discouraged. In the first place, a good many writers who are said to    1.67495327387791
use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional superstition or    1.6065767145351917
tale. Robert Frost, for instance, writes about rural life in New England,    1.6432600607208703
but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in    1.6065767145351917
his poems. This has not, however, prevented publishers from labeling    1.5636360329510388
him a "folk poet", simply because he is a rural one. In the second    1.7026049541338664
place, a large number of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost    1.67495327387791
to being "folk writers" of one sort or another, clearly make    1.6065767145351917
no distinctions between genuine and bogus material. Stephen Vincent    1.5127085093302464
Benet's <John Brown's Body> comes immediately to mind in this    1.5636360329510388
connection, as does John Steinbeck's <The Grapes of Wrath>    1.5127085093302464
and Carl Sandburg's <The People, Yes>. The last two writers    1.5636360329510388
introduce strong political bias into their works, and not unlike the union    1.6432600607208703
leaders that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir of    1.6432600607208703
protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass. Folklore, as    1.5636360329510388
used by such writers, really reflects images engraved into it by the very    1.67495327387791
person using it. The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect    1.6065767145351917
to nation or political attitude. In fact, there is much evidence to    1.6432600607208703
indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular    1.6065767145351917
regional, ethnic and occupational limits. Nevertheless, with a reading    1.5127085093302464
public that longs for the "good old days" and with an awareness    1.6432600607208703
of our expanding international interests, it is easy for the Benets    1.6065767145351917
to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of    1.67495327387791
Americana, real or fake, and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs    1.67495327387791
to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform    1.6065767145351917
into the minds of the folk.    1.2818970554302986
As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the spirit of peace    1.67495327387791
and good will, and in exchange for armed support in the April election    1.67495327387791
campaign, bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne    1.5636360329510388
Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade. The coalition    1.67495327387791
was to prove inadvisable.   O'Banion was a complex and frightening    1.5636360329510388
man, whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour    1.6432600607208703
into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a    1.6432600607208703
jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets    1.67495327387791
into someone's body. He carried three guns- one in the right    1.6065767145351917
trouser pocket, one under his left armpit, one in the left outside coat    1.67495327387791
pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands. He killed accurately,    1.6065767145351917
freely, and dispassionately. The police credited him with twenty-five    1.5127085093302464
murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them.    1.6432600607208703
Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He was an expert    1.67495327387791
florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths.    1.5636360329510388
He had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity    1.5636360329510388
into "right guys" and "wrong guys", and the wrong ones he    1.6065767145351917
was always willing to kill and trample under. He had what was described    1.67495327387791
by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality". He walked with a heavy    1.6432600607208703
list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other,    1.7026049541338664
but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns. Landesco    1.67495327387791
thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly" but he was,    1.6065767145351917
in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference    1.5636360329510388
to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also    1.6065767145351917
at this time, although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets    1.67495327387791
as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and most dangerous mob    1.6065767145351917
leader in the Chicago underworld, the roughneck king.   O'Banion    1.5127085093302464
was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer,    1.6065767145351917
in the North Side's Little Hell, close by the Sicilian quarter    1.6065767145351917
and Death Corner. He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral    1.7026049541338664
and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien. The influence    1.6065767145351917
of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum tenements    1.6432600607208703
among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust saloons of his birthplace;    1.6065767145351917
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood, and    1.6065767145351917
went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging,    1.5127085093302464
and housebreaking. At the age of ten, when he was working as    1.6432600607208703
a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted    1.7026049541338664
in his permanently shortened leg. Because of this he was known as    1.6432600607208703
Gimpy (but, as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in    1.6432600607208703
his presence). In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious    1.6065767145351917
Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's    1.6065767145351917
Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street, where    1.6432600607208703
befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing    1.6065767145351917
waiters before being thrown out. He then got a job with the Chicago    1.67495327387791
<Herald-Examiner> as a circulation slugger, a rough fighter    1.4513752902486308
employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon    1.6432600607208703
by rival vendors. He was also at the same time gaining practical    1.6432600607208703
experience as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how to shoot    1.6432600607208703
to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary, later    1.6065767145351917
committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes    1.6065767145351917
misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish    1.67495327387791
mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.   O'Banion's first conflict    1.5636360329510388
with the police came in 1909, at seventeen, when he was committed    1.6432600607208703
to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary; two years    1.5636360329510388
later he served another three months for assault. Those were his only    1.6432600607208703
interludes behind bars, although he collected four more charges on his    1.6065767145351917
police record in 1921 and 1922, three for burglary and one for robbery.    1.67495327387791
But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.    1.6065767145351917
On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was    1.6065767145351917
furnished by an alderman, and the charge was <nolle prossed>. On one    1.6432600607208703
of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant    1.67495327387791
John J& Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour    1.7026049541338664
office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building; the jury wanted    1.5636360329510388
better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at a cost of $30,000    1.67495327387791
in bribes, it was estimated. As promptly as Torrio, O'Banion jumped    1.6065767145351917
into bootlegging. He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous    1.6065767145351917
violence than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side    1.6065767145351917
portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money. Unlike the    1.67495327387791
Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe-cracking    1.4513752902486308
expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution. He was also personally    1.5636360329510388
active in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired    1.5636360329510388
sufficient political might to be able to state: "I always deliver    1.6065767145351917
my borough as per requirements".   But whose requirements?    1.4513752902486308
Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had    1.4513752902486308
kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic. There was a question-and-answer    1.6065767145351917
gag that went around at that time: Q& "Who'll    1.5127085093302464
carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards"? A& "O'Banion,    1.4513752902486308
in his pistol pocket". But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic    1.6432600607208703
hierarchy    1.0
was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion    1.4513752902486308
was being wooed by the opposition, and was meeting and conferring    1.6065767145351917
with important Republicans. To forestall any change of allegiance,    1.5127085093302464
the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion,    1.5127085093302464
as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where    1.67495327387791
his loyalties lay.   The reception was held in a private dining    1.6065767145351917
room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West. It was an interesting    1.67495327387791
fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers, ward heelers,    1.3761581156320553
sold-out officials, and gunmen. The guest list is in itself a little    1.6432600607208703
parable of the state of American civic life at this time. It included    1.67495327387791
the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.   1.5636360329510388
When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes    1.5636360329510388
for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department    1.6432600607208703
by consorting with these felons and fixers. Hughes said that he had    1.6432600607208703
understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the    1.6432600607208703
proprieter of a Loop gambling house. "But when I arrived and recognised    1.6432600607208703
a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective    1.6065767145351917
bureau basement half a dozen times, I knew I had been framed, and    1.67495327387791
withdrew almost at once".   In fact, O'Connor was honoured    1.5127085093302464
during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.    1.6065767145351917
There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men    1.5636360329510388
jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering    1.7026049541338664
him for a tip. Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum    1.6065767145351917
watch set with rubies and diamonds.   This dinner was the start    1.6065767145351917
of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians,    1.67495327387791
which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, "had been maintained with    1.5636360329510388
more or less stealth", but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious    1.6432600607208703
gatherings, denounced by a clergyman as "Belshazzar feasts",    1.4513752902486308
at which "politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters,    1.5127085093302464
openly, in the big downtown hotels". Pasley continued: "They    1.5127085093302464
became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the    1.67495327387791
moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments    1.5636360329510388
in 1928-29".   However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors    1.5127085093302464
no good whatever. O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes    1.6065767145351917
to his loyalty, and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican    1.6065767145351917
deal. On Election Day- November 4- he energetically marshalled    1.5127085093302464
his force of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat    1.6065767145351917
votes. The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates.   1.5636360329510388
This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power    1.3761581156320553
did not please Torrio and Capone. In the past year there had been    1.67495327387791
too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement    1.5127085093302464
for their liking. He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence    1.6065767145351917
that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards    1.5127085093302464
them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath    1.5636360329510388
their blandness. They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as,    1.5636360329510388
when his bodyguard, Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed    1.6065767145351917
by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of a Jewish    1.5636360329510388
gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation, who were Hirschey,    1.6432600607208703
a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion,    1.5636360329510388
Frank, a policeman, and Max, the youngest. To settle this    1.5636360329510388
slight, O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop,    1.6432600607208703
where, he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening of    1.6065767145351917
a musical comedy. At the end of the performance, Dave and Max came    1.67495327387791
out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed    1.67495327387791
first nighters. O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely    1.6065767145351917
wounding him in the stomach. A second bullet ricocheted off Max's    1.6065767145351917
belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some distress. O'Banion    1.5636360329510388
tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither    1.67495327387791
prosecuted nor even arrested. That sort of braggadocio, for that sort    1.6065767145351917
of reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense.    1.6432600607208703
A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was    1.5636360329510388
when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street    1.7026049541338664
and demanded $300 to let it through. One of the beer-runners telephoned    1.6432600607208703
O'Banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and    1.5636360329510388
reported the situation. O'Banion's reaction was: "Three hundred    1.4513752902486308
dollars! To them bums? Why, I can get them knocked off for    1.6432600607208703
half that much". Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle    1.5636360329510388
squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out    1.6065767145351917
to deal with the hijacking policemen. But in the meantime the beer-runner,    1.6432600607208703
unhappy with this solution, telephoned Torrio and returned to    1.5127085093302464
O'Banion with the message: "Say, Dionie, I just been talking    1.5636360329510388
to Johnny, and he said to let them cops have the three hundred. He    1.7026049541338664
says he don't want no trouble".   But Torrio and Capone had    1.6065767145351917
graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman. For three years,    1.6065767145351917
since the liquor territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic    1.5636360329510388
patience, and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent    1.6065767145351917
warfare and disaster to business, tolerated O'Banion's impudent    1.4513752902486308
double-crossing. They had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of    1.5636360329510388
his sharp practice in Cicero.   When, as a diplomatic gesture    1.5636360329510388
of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election,    1.7026049541338664
Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from    1.6065767145351917
that district had been $20,000 a month. In six months O'Banion had    1.6432600607208703
boosted the profits to $100,000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure    1.6065767145351917
to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the    1.6432600607208703
suburb. These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies    1.6065767145351917
from the Sheldon, Saltis-McErlane, and Druggan-Lake gangs,    1.3761581156320553
and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons;    1.6065767145351917
once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation    1.5127085093302464
of ill will. The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory    1.5127085093302464
went up still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone    1.6432600607208703
takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and    1.6065767145351917
West Sides. But he still showed no intention of sharing with the    1.6432600607208703
syndicate. At last, even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still,    1.6432600607208703
and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage    1.5636360329510388
in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer    1.6432600607208703
concession. O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.   1.6065767145351917
Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion    1.5127085093302464
gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car    1.6065767145351917
load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest    1.6432600607208703
coups of the Prohibition era- the Sibley warehouse robbery,    1.5127085093302464
which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation. Here was    1.6432600607208703
stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky. These 1750 cases were carted    1.6065767145351917
off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men, who left in    1.6432600607208703
their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.   1.5636360329510388
A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake    1.6432600607208703
or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous of all was launched by the    1.67495327387791
explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific    1.67495327387791
at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra    1.6432600607208703
with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away    1.7026049541338664
as San Francisco.   The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic    1.5127085093302464
inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale of    1.5636360329510388
the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth    1.6432600607208703
may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed,    1.6432600607208703
a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea    1.5636360329510388
in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists    1.6065767145351917
in the Biblical story of the Flood.   One of the most damaging    1.6432600607208703
tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November    1.5636360329510388
1, 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away    1.7026049541338664
as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in the Atlantic    1.6065767145351917
Ocean; they are far more common in the Pacific. Japan has had 15    1.67495327387791
destructive ones (eight of them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian    1.5636360329510388
Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.   1.6065767145351917
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled    1.67495327387791
into the Inland Sea; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and    1.6432600607208703
boats in Osaka Bay. A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869    1.6432600607208703
washed away an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn trees    1.6065767145351917
standing where the community had been. In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed    1.6432600607208703
27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes.   The dimensions    1.5127085093302464
of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement. An ordinary    1.6432600607208703
sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to    1.7026049541338664
crest- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the    1.7026049541338664
Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes    1.6432600607208703
as much as 600 miles from crest to crest. While a wind wave never    1.7026049541338664
travels at more than 60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in    1.7026049541338664
the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour. The greater    1.7026049541338664
the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave;    1.67495327387791
Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of    1.67495327387791
the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity. In    1.6432600607208703
the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles    1.7026049541338664
per hour.   Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length    1.6065767145351917
that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable. Their amplitude    1.6065767145351917
sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest. Usually it    1.67495327387791
is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build    1.67495327387791
up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day in 1896 when the    1.67495327387791
great waves approached Japan, fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells.    1.6065767145351917
Not until they sailed home at the end of the day, through a sea    1.7026049541338664
strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware of what    1.67495327387791
had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water    1.6432600607208703
from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning    1.6432600607208703
thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.   The    1.5636360329510388
giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones. They    1.67495327387791
usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into    1.7026049541338664
a ~V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.   1.6065767145351917
Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell,    1.6432600607208703
not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers.    1.6065767145351917
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore    1.67495327387791
as the first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and dry, and    1.67495327387791
the beaches are covered with stranded fish. At Hilo large numbers    1.6065767145351917
of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach.    1.67495327387791
Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for some    1.6432600607208703
minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore. After an earthquake    1.67495327387791
in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified    1.67495327387791
by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher    1.6432600607208703
ground. When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach,    1.6432600607208703
fearing that they might be buried under landslides. Just as they reached    1.6432600607208703
the shore, the first huge wave crashed upon them.   A tsunami    1.6065767145351917
is not a single wave but a series. The waves are separated by intervals    1.7026049541338664
of 15 minutes to an hour or more (because of their great length),    1.67495327387791
and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great    1.6432600607208703
wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves may keep coming for many    1.7269387314284994
hours. Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the    1.67495327387791
biggest.   Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was    1.6065767145351917
Francis P& Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,    1.5127085093302464
one of the world's foremost marine geologists. He was able to make    1.6432600607208703
a detailed inspection of the waves. Their onrush and retreat, he reported,    1.6432600607208703
was accompanied by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The    1.5636360329510388
third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some of the islands'    1.7026049541338664
beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the    1.6065767145351917
shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come.    1.67495327387791
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest waves,    1.7026049541338664
55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.   Scientists and fishermen    1.5127085093302464
have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon. During    1.5127085093302464
a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night. The    1.6432600607208703
luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the    1.67495327387791
stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism <Noctiluca miliaris>    1.5636360329510388
by the turbulence of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes    1.5636360329510388
observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have    1.6432600607208703
enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers    1.5127085093302464
of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance. The    1.6065767145351917
waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and    1.67495327387791
battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth    1.67495327387791
of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.   1.6065767145351917
The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in    1.5127085093302464
Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised    1.5636360329510388
by Commander C& K& Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff.    1.6432600607208703
It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber    1.6065767145351917
which record the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water    1.6432600607208703
tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period of between 10 and    1.67495327387791
40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding    1.7026049541338664
oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.    1.6065767145351917
This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the    1.6432600607208703
station that a tsunami is in progress. Such equipment has been installed    1.6432600607208703
at Hilo, Midway, Attu and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm    1.6065767145351917
goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which    1.5127085093302464
is the center of the warning system.   This center also receives    1.6065767145351917
prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the    1.6065767145351917
Pacific which are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary    1.6065767145351917
determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide    1.5636360329510388
stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By means of charts showing    1.6432600607208703
wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is    1.6432600607208703
possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival    1.6432600607208703
at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific.    1.7026049541338664
The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger,    1.6065767145351917
and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps. All    1.6065767145351917
of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system,    1.5636360329510388
and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work    1.6432600607208703
smoothly.   Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami    1.5636360329510388
in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence. On November 4,    1.67495327387791
1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula.    1.6065767145351917
At 17:07 that afternoon (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded    1.5636360329510388
by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately    1.5636360329510388
went into action. Within about an hour with the help of reports    1.6432600607208703
from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and California, the quake's    1.5636360329510388
epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees    1.6065767145351917
East longitude. While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came    1.6065767145351917
in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported it was covered    1.6432600607208703
with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian station made its calculations    1.6065767145351917
and notified the military services and the police that the first big    1.6432600607208703
wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.   It    1.5636360329510388
turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946. They hurled a    1.7269387314284994
cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone    1.6065767145351917
lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows.    1.4513752902486308
But not a single human life was lost, and property damage in the Hawaiian    1.7026049541338664
Islands did not exceed $800,000. There is little doubt that the    1.6065767145351917
warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.   But it is    1.6065767145351917
plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough. In the    1.6432600607208703
vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against    1.5636360329510388
building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they    1.6432600607208703
be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.    1.6065767145351917
The key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the    1.6432600607208703
same. Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the    1.6065767145351917
sea to complex combinations in man. The land, too, is changing, and    1.6432600607208703
earthquakes are daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements    1.5636360329510388
in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes this is accompanied    1.6432600607208703
by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts    1.5636360329510388
cannot be seen, but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars    1.67495327387791
of earlier breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are most    1.5636360329510388
numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated,    1.5636360329510388
but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth    1.7026049541338664
that has not had them.   The effects of earthquakes on civilization    1.6065767145351917
have been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role of    1.5127085093302464
an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously    1.6065767145351917
frightening, but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular    1.6432600607208703
disaster. Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.   1.5636360329510388
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know    1.6065767145351917
about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth    1.6065767145351917
which emerge with information about the materials through which they    1.5636360329510388
have traveled. These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface    1.6432600607208703
a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.   1.7026049541338664
Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface,    1.5636360329510388
but they do not occur at greater depths. Two unsolved mysteries are    1.6432600607208703
based on these facts. (1) As far down as 400 miles below the surface    1.7026049541338664
the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to    1.67495327387791
twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface    1.6432600607208703
rocks do. (2) If earthquakes do occur at such depths, why not deeper?   1.67495327387791
Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been    1.4513752902486308
applied in various fields. In the search for oil and gas, we make    1.67495327387791
similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from    1.5636360329510388
them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation    1.6065767145351917
of these resources. We have also developed techniques for recognizing    1.5636360329510388
and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the    1.5636360329510388
ground which they generate.   The following discussion of this subject    1.5636360329510388
has been adapted from the book {Causes of Catastrophe} by    1.5636360329510388
L& Don Leet.    1.0
<At twelve    1.0
minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday>, April 18, 1906,    1.6065767145351917
San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake. A sharp tremor    1.6065767145351917
was followed by a jerky roll.   1.2818970554302986
{IN} Ireland's County Limerick, near the River    1.3761581156320553
Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which    1.67495327387791
means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the residents realize    1.5636360329510388
the influence their town has had on American military history,    1.5636360329510388
or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"!    1.7269387314284994
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was    1.5636360329510388
the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes,    1.6432600607208703
Sioux and Apaches, Mexican <banditos> under Pancho Villa, Japanese    1.5127085093302464
in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists    1.5636360329510388
in Korea. Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U& S& Cavalry    1.67495327387791
Regiment, "The Fighting Seventh".   Today a battle    1.3761581156320553
cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, <esprit de corps>    1.67495327387791
has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables. But don't    1.5636360329510388
tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a    1.6432600607208703
saloon on Saturday night.   Of all the thousands of men who have    1.6432600607208703
served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than    1.67495327387791
Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C& Chandler. Wiry and burr-headed,    1.4513752902486308
with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler    1.6065767145351917
is the epitome of the old-time trooper. The truth is, however, that    1.6432600607208703
when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he    1.6432600607208703
had ever ridden    1.0
was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded    1.6432600607208703
was a pencil.   Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical    1.5636360329510388
Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas    1.6432600607208703
City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make    1.67495327387791
the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it. Though    1.7269387314284994
he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other    1.6432600607208703
desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces. The    1.6432600607208703
next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer    1.6432600607208703
of Troop ~H, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.   1.67495327387791
Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher    1.5636360329510388
spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a new ~CO brought in from    1.7269387314284994
the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper. Second,    1.5127085093302464
if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's    1.748515906000203
on maneuvers. In combat, helping your ~CO make a fool of himself    1.6432600607208703
might mean getting yourself killed. But in maneuvers, with the top    1.6065767145351917
brass watching him all the time, it's easy.   Chandler understood    1.5636360329510388
this and expected the worst. But his first few days with Troop    1.6432600607208703
~H were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert    1.5636360329510388
Early. Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.    1.6432600607208703
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident. He had    1.5636360329510388
enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately    1.6432600607208703
set about learning his new trade. There was no weapon Early could not    1.67495327387791
take apart and reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and    1.6065767145351917
he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's    1.7026049541338664
correspondence courses. He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics,    1.5127085093302464
history and literature as well.   But for all his erudite    1.5636360329510388
confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold.    1.5636360329510388
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved    1.6432600607208703
Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new ~CO know just how lucky    1.6432600607208703
he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United    1.7269387314284994
States Army. He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and    1.67495327387791
the regiment. For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry    1.6432600607208703
under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the    1.6432600607208703
Battle of The Little Big Horn.   It didn't take Captain    1.5636360329510388
Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition    1.7026049541338664
on his shoulders as commander of Troop ~H. But what made the    1.6432600607208703
load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper    1.6065767145351917
was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop    1.7269387314284994
and the regiment.   Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison    1.5636360329510388
duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was the    1.6065767145351917
7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial    1.5636360329510388
Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler was not completely    1.6065767145351917
convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen".    1.6065767145351917
The final proof was a small incident.   It happened    1.5127085093302464
at the St& Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which    1.67495327387791
had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains    1.67495327387791
of an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler looked    1.6432600607208703
up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above    1.67495327387791
the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen. The faces belonged    1.6065767145351917
to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And    1.6065767145351917
when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish    1.67495327387791
songs the best.   Though there was an occasional good-natured    1.5127085093302464
chuckle about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago,    1.5127085093302464
singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really thought it was strange.    1.67495327387791
For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni Martini, the bugler boy    1.5127085093302464
who carried Custer's last message, or Margarito Lopez, the one-man    1.5636360329510388
Army on Leyte, was a Garryowen, through and through. It was no    1.6432600607208703
coincidence    1.0
that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders    1.5636360329510388
in the regiment.   And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen.    1.6432600607208703
He set out to keep Troop ~H the best troop in the best regiment.    1.7026049541338664
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook    1.67495327387791
and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the    1.6432600607208703
troop. Even the mess sergeant, Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer    1.6065767145351917
from an airborne division, went out on the range.   The troop received    1.6432600607208703
a new leader, Lieutenant Robert M& Carroll, fresh out of    1.5636360329510388
~ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status. Carroll was sharp    1.5636360329510388
and military, but he was up against tough competition for that ~RA    1.6432600607208703
berth, and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set out to    1.7026049541338664
sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold    1.7026049541338664
a short time before.   When the Korean war began, on June 25,    1.6432600607208703
1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the    1.67495327387791
Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead    1.6432600607208703
of Leyte during World War /2,, the 7th Cavalry was not in the    1.67495327387791
best fighting condition. Its entire complement of non-commissioned    1.4513752902486308
officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit,    1.6432600607208703
and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World    1.7026049541338664
War /2,.   Just a month after the Korean War broke out,    1.6065767145351917
the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat. From    1.6432600607208703
then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting    1.67495327387791
in Korea.   One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler    1.5636360329510388
called on that fabled <esprit de corps>. The regiment was dug in    1.6432600607208703
on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building    1.7026049541338664
up a concentration of crack troops on the other side. The troopers    1.6432600607208703
knew an attack was coming, but they didn't know when, and they    1.6432600607208703
didn't know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12, they    1.67495327387791
were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against Troop ~H.   1.6065767145351917
The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full    1.67495327387791
force of 1000 men, armed with Russian machine guns, attacked the position    1.6432600607208703
held by Chandler's men. They came in waves. First came the    1.6065767145351917
cannon fodder, white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive    1.6065767145351917
human battering ram. They were followed by crack North Korean troops,    1.6065767145351917
who mounted one charge after another. They overran the 7th Cav's    1.6065767145351917
forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers, over    1.5127085093302464
piles of their own dead.   Another force flanked the company    1.5636360329510388
and took up a position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw    1.7026049541338664
that it was building up strength. He assembled a group of 25 men, composed    1.7026049541338664
of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply    1.5127085093302464
men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill. One of the more    1.7026049541338664
seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking    1.5127085093302464
for the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill    1.67495327387791
to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.   Then    1.6065767145351917
Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one step, two, broke    1.6432600607208703
into a trot and then into a run. The first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"!    1.748515906000203
burst from his throat. His followers shouted the old    1.5127085093302464
battle cry after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.   1.6432600607208703
The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned    1.7026049541338664
down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire. Chandler, looking to    1.6065767145351917
right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure    1.7026049541338664
bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry    1.6065767145351917
as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued    1.67495327387791
with the spirit of Garryowen. He had formed his own task force    1.6432600607208703
of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge.    1.7026049541338664
Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been    1.6065767145351917
pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again. But an enemy    1.7026049541338664
grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously. He    1.5636360329510388
went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face    1.7269387314284994
of    1.0
the withering enemy fire.   Enemy reinforcements came pouring down,    1.5127085093302464
seeking a soft spot. They found it at the junction between Troops    1.6432600607208703
~H and ~G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin Goulding saw    1.5636360329510388
what was happening. He turned to his platoon. "Okay, men", he    1.6065767145351917
said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward,    1.6065767145351917
"Garryowen"! on his lips, his men following. But the bullets    1.5636360329510388
whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding    1.6065767145351917
fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that    1.6432600607208703
their lieutenant,    1.0
the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead.    1.5127085093302464
Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming    1.67495327387791
and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy like    1.5127085093302464
wild men.   That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant    1.6065767145351917
Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy    1.5127085093302464
soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements    1.6432600607208703
came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's    1.6432600607208703
platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled    1.5636360329510388
across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes were called in    1.6065767145351917
to kill them by the hundreds.   Though Bob Carroll seemed to have    1.6432600607208703
had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived.    1.6432600607208703
Today he is a major- in the Regular Army.   So filled    1.6065767145351917
was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was    1.6432600607208703
over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment.    1.7026049541338664
After years of digging, nights and weekends, he put together the    1.6065767145351917
big, profusely illustrated book, <Of Garryowen and Glory>, which    1.5127085093302464
The    1.0
battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle    1.67495327387791
cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off. For nearly    1.67495327387791
a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the    1.7026049541338664
regiment.   Take the case of Major Marcus A& Reno, who survived    1.6065767145351917
the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the enlisted    1.6432600607208703
men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried    1.6065767145351917
to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus    1.7026049541338664
Reno. Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But    1.6432600607208703
when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice    1.7026049541338664
made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield    1.6432600607208703
and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left    1.67495327387791
to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him.    1.7026049541338664
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.   Although it was    1.6065767145351917
at    1.0
the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been    1.6432600607208703
written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry    1.6432600607208703
first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by    1.67495327387791
then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's    1.5636360329510388
first permanent commander and, like such generals as George    1.5127085093302464
S& Patton and Terry de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military    1.67495327387791
prominence,    1.0
Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.   During    1.5636360329510388
the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant record, was    1.5636360329510388
made    1.0
brigadier general at the age of 23.   He finished the war as    1.6432600607208703
a major general, commanding a full division, and at 25 was the youngest    1.67495327387791
major general in the history of the U& S& Army.    1.5636360329510388
I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in    1.6432600607208703
the sense that everyone agrees with them. If they were, Walter Lippmann    1.6432600607208703
would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock    1.6065767145351917
would have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however, that    1.6432600607208703
<I> take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying    1.6432600607208703
would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions. _ASSUMPTION    1.5127085093302464
1._ The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish    1.6065767145351917
a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom    1.6432600607208703
and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular-    1.5636360329510388
since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions    1.5127085093302464
be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak of "the largest    1.7026049541338664
possible measure" because any person who supposes that these    1.5127085093302464
conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons    1.5127085093302464
without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human    1.5636360329510388
beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around. _ASSUMPTION    1.6065767145351917
2._ These conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable    1.5127085093302464
in the qualified sense I have indicated- without the prior defeat    1.6065767145351917
of world Communism. This is true for two reasons: because Communism    1.6065767145351917
is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions;    1.5636360329510388
and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet    1.6065767145351917
power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization. Moreover,    1.5636360329510388
as Communist power increases, the enjoyment of these conditions    1.5127085093302464
throughout the world diminishes <pro rata> and the possibility of    1.5636360329510388
their restoration becomes increasingly remote. _ASSUMPTION 3._ It    1.4513752902486308
follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal    1.5636360329510388
of American policy. Proximate in the sense that there are more distant,    1.6432600607208703
more "positive" ends we seek, to which victory over Communism    1.5636360329510388
is but a means. But dominant in the sense that every other objective,    1.67495327387791
no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it. Peace is a worthy    1.67495327387791
objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the    1.6065767145351917
Communists out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the sense    1.6432600607208703
of self-determination, is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination    1.5636360329510388
to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into    1.5127085093302464
the Sino-Soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice    1.5636360329510388
is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails driving    1.6065767145351917
the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West,    1.6432600607208703
then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards    1.6065767145351917
yet a while longer. Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing    1.6432600607208703
higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient    1.6065767145351917
guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and    1.5127085093302464
denials will have to be made. It may be, of course, that such objectives    1.7026049541338664
can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism;    1.6065767145351917
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be    1.6065767145351917
resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant    1.6065767145351917
world- the absence of Soviet Communist power.    1.3761581156320553
This much having been said, the question remains whether we    1.5636360329510388
have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat Communism-    1.6432600607208703
and, if so, how those resources ought to be used. This brings us squarely    1.7026049541338664
to the problem of <power,> and the uses a nation makes of power.    1.67495327387791
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that    1.6432600607208703
it always has been, that it always will be. And I suggest further    1.67495327387791
that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of    1.7269387314284994
American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership    1.5127085093302464
in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.    1.5636360329510388
In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting    1.5636360329510388
the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them    1.7269387314284994
into proper focus. One was demonstrably false; the other, for the    1.6065767145351917
most part, true.   The first was that America had become- or    1.6065767145351917
was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I know I    1.6432600607208703
do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention. You    1.67495327387791
may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment-    1.5636360329510388
I certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all American    1.6065767145351917
strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States    1.5127085093302464
not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the    1.67495327387791
development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent    1.6432600607208703
feature of U&S&-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future.   1.4513752902486308
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority    1.6432600607208703
on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr& Jameson    1.6065767145351917
Campaigne has done it well in his new book <American Might and Soviet    1.67495327387791
Myth>. Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we    1.6065767145351917
were in the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000    1.6065767145351917
modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases    1.6065767145351917
in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming Russian naval power would    1.5636360329510388
always be within a few hundred miles of our coast. Half of the population    1.7026049541338664
of the U&S& would be needed to work on arms just to feed    1.67495327387791
the people". Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where    1.67495327387791
oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity.    1.67495327387791
Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would    1.5127085093302464
severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the    1.67495327387791
missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.   If    1.6065767145351917
we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's    1.7026049541338664
nightmarish worries- or, at least, of the worries he might have if    1.6432600607208703
his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage.    1.4513752902486308
The other charge was that America's political position    1.4513752902486308
in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years. The    1.5636360329510388
contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it    1.6065767145351917
ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to    1.7026049541338664
see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.   1.6432600607208703
The argument was typically advanced in terms of U&S& "prestige".    1.5636360329510388
Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem; and    1.6065767145351917
even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading. Prestige    1.6432600607208703
is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill. But contrary    1.7269387314284994
to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important    1.6432600607208703
for its own sake. Only the vain and incurably sentimental among    1.6065767145351917
us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed    1.6432600607208703
by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose sleep over    1.7026049541338664
is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are    1.67495327387791
likely to do about it.   The evidence suggests that foreign peoples    1.6065767145351917
believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and    1.6065767145351917
is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead. This ignorant    1.67495327387791
estimate, I repeat, is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes    1.67495327387791
very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically    1.6065767145351917
do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be    1.67495327387791
the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining U&S& prestige    1.6065767145351917
means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on    1.6432600607208703
an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet    1.6432600607208703
intimidation, there is reason for concern.   Still, these guesses    1.5127085093302464
about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the    1.6432600607208703
actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here    1.5636360329510388
I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and    1.67495327387791
overwhelming but of political power- of influence, if you will-    1.5636360329510388
about which the relevant questions are: Is Soviet influence throughout    1.5636360329510388
the world greater or less than it was ten years ago? And is Western    1.7026049541338664
influence greater or less than it used to be?    1.5127085093302464
In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether    1.6065767145351917
Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy    1.6065767145351917
before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform    1.5636360329510388
are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded:    1.6065767145351917
the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend    1.6065767145351917
on such spectacular and definitive conquests. Success may mean merely    1.5636360329510388
the displacement of Western influence.   Communist political    1.3761581156320553
warfare, we must remember, is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages.    1.6065767145351917
Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they    1.6065767145351917
could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where    1.6065767145351917
the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla    1.6065767145351917
skirmishes,    1.0
in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine    1.5636360329510388
meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations,    1.4513752902486308
on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences- preferably at    1.5127085093302464
the highest level.   The Soviets understand, moreover, that the    1.5127085093302464
first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against    1.67495327387791
the West. Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover    1.6065767145351917
is to "neutralize" a country. The second stage is to retain the    1.6432600607208703
nominal classification of "neutralist", while in fact turning the    1.5127085093302464
country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy. And    1.6065767145351917
this may be as far as the process will go. The Kremlin's goal is    1.7026049541338664
the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States-    1.6432600607208703
and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade    1.6432600607208703
under a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries    1.5636360329510388
of the Soviet Foreign Office.   To recite the particulars of    1.5636360329510388
recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring.   Six years ago    1.5127085093302464
French Indochina, though in troubie, was in the Western camp. Today    1.6065767145351917
Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between    1.5127085093302464
Communism and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all    1.4513752902486308
practical purposes, neutralist.   Indonesia, in the early days of    1.5127085093302464
the Republic, leaned toward the West. Today Sukarno's government    1.5127085093302464
is heavily besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist"    1.6432600607208703
pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.   Ceylon    1.5636360329510388
has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly    1.5636360329510388
hostile to the West.   In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and    1.6065767145351917
Egypt were, a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser    1.67495327387791
and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent    1.6065767145351917
for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel;    1.5127085093302464
in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.   1.5636360329510388
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve. Never    1.6065767145351917
mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination:    1.5636360329510388
the point is that in the struggle for the world that    1.6065767145351917
vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West. Today,    1.67495327387791
Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging,    1.5636360329510388
it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.   Latin America was once    1.6065767145351917
an area as "safe" for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today    1.67495327387791
it is up for grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become    1.6432600607208703
a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In some countries    1.6065767145351917
the trend has gone further than others: Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela    1.6065767145351917
are displaying open sympathy for Castroism, and there is no country-    1.6065767145351917
save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently    1.5127085093302464
arranged- where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent    1.4513752902486308
the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause.   1.4513752902486308
Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the    1.67495327387791
surface. The strains of neutralism are running strong, notably in    1.5636360329510388
England, and even in Germany.    1.1606783668269585
What have    1.0
we to show by way of counter-successes? We have had opportunities-    1.6065767145351917
clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron    1.67495327387791
Curtain. There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised    1.5127085093302464
and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish Revolution    1.6065767145351917
which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable    1.6065767145351917
to Soviet interests. There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended    1.6432600607208703
did not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively    1.6065767145351917
and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power: in Guatemala.    1.5127085093302464
And contrary to what has been said recently, we did not wait for "outside    1.7026049541338664
pressures" and "world opinion" to bring down that Communist    1.5127085093302464
government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist    1.4513752902486308
<coup    1.0
d'etat>. We served our national interests, and by so doing we    1.6065767145351917
saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.   1.5127085093302464
THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening,    1.6432600607208703
roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.   "Sounds    1.6065767145351917
exactly like last time". The young man spoke steadily enough,    1.5636360329510388
but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven. The middle-aged man    1.6065767145351917
said over and over, "Why did I come here, why did I come    1.67495327387791
here".    1.0
Then he was sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons,    1.67495327387791
I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the lights went out.   1.6065767145351917
This was my    1.0
second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of    1.4513752902486308
Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave. Where was my flashlight?    1.6432600607208703
Where should I go? To my room? Better stay in the hotel lobby,    1.67495327387791
where the walls looked good and thick.   Chinese and Indian    1.5636360329510388
merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters. Hotel    1.5636360329510388
attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small    1.6432600607208703
boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please".    1.5127085093302464
She held out her hand to show that she had money.   The American    1.67495327387791
newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office. But what    1.5636360329510388
was the story? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this    1.6065767145351917
far? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane?   "Let's    1.5127085093302464
play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof and see".    1.6065767145351917
By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had    1.4513752902486308
been an eclipse of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that    1.6432600607208703
the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all    1.7269387314284994
possible noise, ideally with firearms.   The din was successful,    1.5127085093302464
too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had    1.6065767145351917
begun    1.0
to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.   How    1.6432600607208703
quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant posted a reminder to    1.67495327387791
patrons "who became excited and left without paying their checks".    1.5636360329510388
But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later.    1.6432600607208703
And no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood, had    1.6065767145351917
become the City of Bullet Holes.   I saw holes in planes at the    1.67495327387791
airport and in cars in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly    1.6432600607208703
a house had not been peppered. In place of the police headquarters    1.6432600607208703
was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars had demolished the    1.6065767145351917
defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door. What    1.6432600607208703
had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened    1.6065767145351917
brick.   This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane,    1.6065767145351917
fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments    1.5636360329510388
had ruled here in three days (December 9-11, 1960). And now, in March,    1.67495327387791
all Laos suffered a state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held    1.6432600607208703
two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.    1.6065767145351917
Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush    1.5636360329510388
and death.   "And it's all the more tragic because it's    1.5636360329510388
so little deserved", said Mr& J& J& A& Frans, a Belgian    1.6065767145351917
official of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural    1.5127085093302464
Organization. We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with    1.5636360329510388
the U& N& flag.   Practically all the people of Laos, he    1.6065767145351917
explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers, and the means    1.6432600607208703
and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel    1.7026049541338664
plows. They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes    1.6065767145351917
in ten or eleven thousand villages, with an average of 200 souls.    1.6432600607208703
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are. They spread    1.6432600607208703
over an area no larger than Oregon; yet they include peoples as different    1.67495327387791
from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians.    1.4513752902486308
"What matters here is family loyalty;    1.2818970554302986
faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the <phis>, the spirits;    1.67495327387791
and to live in harmony with nature".   Harmony in Laos?    1.5636360329510388
"Precisely", said Mr& Frans. He spoke of the season of    1.5636360329510388
dryness and dust, brought by the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony    1.6432600607208703
with the season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from the southwest.    1.7026049541338664
The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering    1.5127085093302464
Mekong River. Shy, slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with    1.6065767145351917
the frangipani by the wayside. Even life in harmony with death. For    1.6432600607208703
so long as death was not violent, it was natural and to be welcomed,    1.7026049541338664
making a funeral a feast.   To many a Frenchman- they came    1.6065767145351917
95 years ago, colonized, and stayed until Laos became independent in    1.6065767145351917
1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti.    1.6065767145351917
Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen    1.6432600607208703
around the globe. The Pathet Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans    1.5636360329510388
from neighboring North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft.    1.5636360329510388
The Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped with    1.67495327387791
American funds. In six years, U& S& aid had amounted to more    1.6432600607208703
than $1.60 for each American- a total of three hundred million dollars.   1.6432600607208703
We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened    1.6432600607208703
to ignite another war among the world's giants. Even if it    1.6065767145351917
did not, how would this little world of gentle people cope with its    1.67495327387791
new reality of grenades and submachine guns?   To find out, we    1.6065767145351917
traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled, in    1.5636360329510388
the daytime at least, by the Royal Lao Army: from Attopeu, the    1.6432600607208703
City    1.0
of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the City of    1.6432600607208703
Lions in the northwest, close to Communist China (map, page 250).    1.6065767145351917
We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil    1.7269387314284994
between ruts, all four wheels spinning uselessly. We flew in rickety    1.6065767145351917
planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash. In the    1.6432600607208703
end we ran into Communist artillery fire.   "We" were Bill    1.5636360329510388
Garrett of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Illustrations Staff, whose    1.4513752902486308
three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any    1.6432600607208703
fighting man we met; Boun My, our interpreter; and myself.   1.5636360329510388
Boun My- the name means one who has a <boun>, a celebration, and    1.67495327387791
is therefore lucky- was born in Savannakhet, the Border of Paradise.    1.6065767145351917
He had attended three universities in the United States. But    1.5636360329510388
he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane,    1.7026049541338664
including the royal capital, Luang Prabang. Before the airplanes    1.5127085093302464
came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible.    1.5636360329510388
Alas, so it almost proved for us, too. To    1.5127085093302464
go outside the few cities required permits. and getting them seemed    1.6065767145351917
a life's work. Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured, and    1.6432600607208703
few soldiers could be spared as escorts.   We were told that to    1.6432600607208703
the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped American was worth at least $750, a fortune    1.67495327387791
in Laos. Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had    1.6065767145351917
spurned an escort. Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching    1.5636360329510388
him barefoot from village to village, as evidence of evil American    1.6065767145351917
intervention.   Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government    1.5127085093302464
offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation    1.5636360329510388
in French, we were getting nowhere. We had nearly decided    1.5636360329510388
that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true, when we were invited    1.7026049541338664
to take a trip with the Prime Minister. Could we be ready in 15    1.7026049541338664
minutes? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of    1.67495327387791
town, and he was eager to be off.    1.4513752902486308
And    1.0
so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing    1.6065767145351917
along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun    1.6065767145351917
Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket    1.67495327387791
and a ten-gallon hat from Texas. From his shoulder bag peeked the    1.6432600607208703
seven-inch barrel of a Luger.   The temperature rose to 105`.    1.5636360329510388
With our company of soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.   1.67495327387791
In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister    1.5636360329510388
bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks for me.    1.6065767145351917
Then we drove on, until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice    1.7269387314284994
fields, bouncing across their squat earth walls.   It was a    1.5636360329510388
spleen-crushing day. An hour of bouncing, a brief stop in a village to    1.67495327387791
inspect a new school or dispensary. More bouncing, another stop, a    1.6065767145351917
new house for teachers, a new well. Then off again, rushing to keep up.    1.7026049541338664
We were miserable.   But our two Jeep mates- Keo Viphakone    1.5636360329510388
from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania-    1.5127085093302464
were beaming under their coatings of dust. Together they had probably    1.6065767145351917
done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century-    1.7026049541338664
constructively. Mr& Keo, once a diplomat in Paris and Washington,    1.5636360329510388
was Commissioner of Rural Affairs. John, an engineer and anthropologist    1.5636360329510388
with a doctorate from the London School of Economics,    1.5127085093302464
headed the rural development division of ~USOM, the United States    1.5636360329510388
Operations Mission administering U&S& aid.   "What    1.2818970554302986
you see are self-help projects", John said. "We ask the people    1.6065767145351917
what they want, and they supply the labor. We send shovels, cement,    1.6432600607208703
nails,    1.0
and corrugated iron for roofs. That way they have an infirmary    1.6065767145351917
for $400. We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up to a lot more    1.7269387314284994
than just roads and wells and schools. Ask Mr& Keo".    1.5636360329510388
Mr&    1.0
Keo agreed. "Our people have been used to accepting things as    1.6065767145351917
they found them", he said. "Where there was no road, they lived    1.6432600607208703
without one. Now they learn that men can change their surroundings,    1.6065767145351917
through their traditional village elders, without violence. That's    1.4513752902486308
a big step toward a modern state. You might say we are in the nation-building    1.7269387314284994
business".   In the villages people lined up to give    1.5127085093302464
us flowers. Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine. The Prime Minister    1.6432600607208703
paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode rapidly among the    1.6065767145351917
houses, joked with the local soldiery, and made a speech. The soldiers    1.6432600607208703
are fighting and the Americans are helping, he said, but in the    1.6432600607208703
fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.   1.6432600607208703
Then we were off again. We did it for three days.   But    1.6432600607208703
our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery. Crossing the 4,000-foot    1.6432600607208703
width of the Mekong at Champassak, on a raft with an outboard    1.6432600607208703
motor, we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean    1.6432600607208703
breeze. Then we hung overboard in the water.   Briefly we rolled    1.6065767145351917
over a paved road up to Pak Song, on the cool Bolovens Plateau.    1.67495327387791
The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported    1.5127085093302464
by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and fed rice    1.6432600607208703
to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song.    1.6432600607208703
In the village of Soukhouma, which means    1.3761581156320553
"Peaceful", we had a <baci>. This is the most endearing of Lao    1.6432600607208703
ceremonies. It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing    1.6065767145351917
for myriad occasions- for the traveler, a wedding, a newborn child,    1.6065767145351917
the sick, the New Year, for any good purpose.   The preparations    1.6065767145351917
were elaborate: flowers, candles, incense sticks, rice wine, dozens    1.5127085093302464
of delicacies, and pieces of white cotton string. The strings were    1.6065767145351917
draped around flowers in tall silver bowls (page 261).   The    1.5636360329510388
candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village    1.6432600607208703
notables. I was careful to keep my feet, the seat of the least worthy    1.7026049541338664
spirits, from pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits    1.5636360329510388
reside. Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to    1.6065767145351917
come and join us.   Next he addressed himself to our souls. A    1.6432600607208703
man has 32 souls, one for each part of the body. Those souls like to    1.7269387314284994
wander off, and must be called back.   With the divinities present    1.6065767145351917
and our souls in place, we were wished health, happiness, and power.    1.6432600607208703
Then, one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings    1.6065767145351917
around our wrists. These were to be kept on, to hold in the 32 souls.   1.7269387314284994
As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came up to John    1.67495327387791
Cool and silently showed him his hand. It had a festering hole as    1.67495327387791
big as a silver dollar. We could see maggots moving.   John said:    1.6432600607208703
"I have some antiseptic salve with me, but it's too late for    1.6432600607208703
that".   1.0
My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening    1.5636360329510388
of religious and ethnic bonds. Jewish identity was often confused    1.5636360329510388
with social and economic strivings. "Being Jewish gives you tremendous    1.5636360329510388
drive", a boy remarked. "It means that you have to get    1.6065767145351917
ahead". When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I encountered    1.6065767145351917
the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith good will, and    1.5636360329510388
a small residue of ethnic loyalty.   "I like the tradition",    1.5636360329510388
a girl said. "I like to follow the holidays when they come along.    1.67495327387791
But you don't have to worship in the traditional way. You can communicate    1.67495327387791
in your own way. As I see it, there's no real difference between    1.67495327387791
being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant".   Another teen-ager    1.3761581156320553
remarked: "Most Jews don't believe in God, but they believe    1.5636360329510388
in people- in helping people". Still another boy asserted:    1.5127085093302464
"To be a good Jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person".    1.748515906000203
When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant,    1.6065767145351917
the boy answered, "It's the same thing".   This accords    1.5127085093302464
with the study by Maier and Spinrad. They discovered that, although    1.6065767145351917
42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the    1.7269387314284994
Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings    1.6065767145351917
of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this    1.67495327387791
conviction. The most important aims of the Jewish students were as    1.6065767145351917
follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent;    1.7026049541338664
to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence-    1.6065767145351917
21 per cent.   Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers    1.4513752902486308
I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even    1.5636360329510388
envisioned joining a synagogue or temple. However, they were hostile    1.5636360329510388
to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to believe in Judaism "but in a    1.6065767145351917
moderate way". One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews: "It's    1.5636360329510388
the twentieth century, and they don't have to wear beards".   1.5636360329510388
The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked    1.5636360329510388
force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds. "We were brought    1.6065767145351917
up that way" was one statement which won general assent. "I    1.6065767145351917
want to show respect for my parents' religion" was the way in which    1.67495327387791
a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism. Still    1.6065767145351917
another suggested that he would join a temple "for social reasons,    1.6065767145351917
since I'll be living in a suburb".   Intermarriage, which    1.5127085093302464
is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not    1.6432600607208703
with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval.    1.6432600607208703
Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic    1.5636360329510388
grounds. "When you marry, you want to have things in common", a    1.6432600607208703
girl said, "and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your    1.6432600607208703
own background".   A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle    1.4513752902486308
West observed wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently interfered    1.5636360329510388
with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities    1.5127085093302464
that many middle class Jews now regard as religious. It appears    1.6065767145351917
that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing    1.6432600607208703
sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would    1.6065767145351917
not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food. Another    1.6065767145351917
girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as "the    1.6065767145351917
only Orthodox girl in town". This is, no doubt, inaccurate,    1.5636360329510388
but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the    1.7026049541338664
nonobservant.    1.0
One of the significant things about    1.2818970554302986
Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.    1.67495327387791
Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college    1.5127085093302464
age attend institutions of higher learning. This is substantially higher    1.5636360329510388
than the figures for the American population at large- 45.6 per    1.6065767145351917
cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females. This may help explain    1.67495327387791
a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy. In their first two    1.6432600607208703
years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions    1.6432600607208703
to win positions on the school teams. However, in their junior and    1.6432600607208703
senior years, they generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably    1.5127085093302464
in the interest of better academic achievement. It is significant,    1.5636360329510388
too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed, unlike the    1.5636360329510388
younger ones, that Jewish students tend to do better academically than    1.6065767145351917
their gentile counterparts.   The percentage of Jewish girls    1.4513752902486308
who attend college is almost as high as that of boys. The motivations    1.67495327387791
for both sexes, to be sure, are different. The vocational motive is    1.6432600607208703
the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls attend college for social    1.6432600607208703
reasons and to become culturally developed. One of the significant    1.5636360329510388
developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers    1.5127085093302464
are largely the women. It is they who read- and make- Jewish    1.6432600607208703
best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.   In    1.5636360329510388
upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group tends to have a sense    1.6432600607208703
of marginality. "People automatically assume that I'm in college",    1.5127085093302464
a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably. However, among    1.3761581156320553
the girls, there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going    1.5636360329510388
to college. The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an    1.6065767145351917
office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and, buttressed    1.5127085093302464
by a respectable income, she is likely to dress better and live    1.6432600607208703
more expansively than the college student. She is even prone to regard    1.6432600607208703
the college girl as immature.    1.1606783668269585
One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers    1.6065767145351917
in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend    1.67495327387791
local colleges at modest cost. This is particularly true in large centers    1.6432600607208703
of Jewish population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.   1.5127085093302464
What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is    1.5636360329510388
that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their    1.5127085093302464
gentile counterparts,    1.0
they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed    1.5127085093302464
Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish    1.5127085093302464
world.   Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College-    1.4513752902486308
constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can    1.6432600607208703
serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle class Jewish student.   1.6065767145351917
There is, to begin, an important sex difference. Typically, in    1.5636360329510388
a lower-middle class Jewish family, a son will be sent to an out-of-town    1.67495327387791
school, if financial resources warrant it, while the daughter will    1.5636360329510388
attend the local college. There are two reasons for this. First,    1.6065767145351917
the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's. Second,    1.6065767145351917
the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter    1.6432600607208703
than toward the son. Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise    1.6065767145351917
vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by    1.6065767145351917
keeping them home. The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn    1.67495327387791
College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically.    1.5127085093302464
One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.   1.67495327387791
Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their    1.5127085093302464
school. On the one hand, there is a sense of not having moved beyond    1.7026049541338664
the ambiance of their high school. This is particularly acute for    1.6065767145351917
those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street    1.5636360329510388
from Brooklyn College. They have a sense of marginality at being denied    1.6432600607208703
that special badge of status, the out-of-town school. At the same    1.6065767145351917
time, there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good    1.6432600607208703
college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable    1.5636360329510388
virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling    1.5636360329510388
that the college generates. "It's people of your own kind", a girl    1.6432600607208703
remarked. "You don't have to watch what you say. Of course,    1.6065767145351917
I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds    1.7026049541338664
of people, but I would want lots of Jewish kids there".   For    1.6432600607208703
most Brooklyn College students, college is at once a perpetuation    1.5636360329510388
of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood    1.67495327387791
and family. @rooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in    1.4513752902486308
tone, and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably    1.6065767145351917
midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing. However, a    1.5636360329510388
growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by    1.5127085093302464
courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly    1.5127085093302464
critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents. And    1.5127085093302464
the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional    1.6065767145351917
conflict of culture but, rather, a protest against a culture that they    1.6432600607208703
view as softly and insidiously enveloping. "As long as I'm home,    1.6065767145351917
I'll never grow up", a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.    1.5127085093302464
"They don't like it if I do anything away from home. It's so    1.67495327387791
much trouble, I don't usually bother".   For girls, the overprotection    1.5636360329510388
is far more pervasive. Parents will drive on Friday night    1.5636360329510388
to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting.    1.6432600607208703
A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn    1.67495327387791
College and demanded the "low-down" on a boy who was going out    1.6432600607208703
with his daughter. The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice    1.6065767145351917
of a major field. Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn    1.6432600607208703
College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with    1.5636360329510388
marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient    1.4513752902486308
working hours. This means that a great many academically talented girls    1.6065767145351917
are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.    1.6065767145351917
A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls    1.6432600607208703
as it does in the realm of sex.   The breaking away from the prison    1.7026049541338664
house of Brooklyn is gradual. First, the student trains on his    1.6065767145351917
hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological    1.5636360329510388
and sociological insights. Then, with the new affluence, there is    1.5636360329510388
actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide world beyond the precincts    1.6432600607208703
of New York. It is significant that the Catskills, which used to    1.6432600607208703
be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb    1.6432600607208703
of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for    1.6432600607208703
those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day    1.67495327387791
camps. The great world beyond beckons. But it should be pointed out    1.6432600607208703
that some of the new watering places- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton,    1.6065767145351917
Long Island, for example- tend to be homogeneously Jewish.    1.5127085093302464
Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad    1.5127085093302464
program, a good number of students spend summers in Europe. In    1.6065767145351917
general, however, the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that    1.5636360329510388
of the student at Harvard or Smith. And acculturation into the world    1.6432600607208703
at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after    1.6432600607208703
college rather than during the four school years.   Brooklyn    1.5127085093302464
College is Marjorie Morningstar territory, as much as the Bronx or    1.6065767145351917
Central Park West. There are hordes of nubile young women there    1.6065767145351917
who, prodded by their impatient mothers, are determined to marry.    1.5636360329510388
It is interesting that, although the percentage of married students    1.5636360329510388
is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per    1.6065767145351917
cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class-    1.7269387314284994
the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate. "Almost    1.6065767145351917
everybody in the senior class is married", students say dogmatically.    1.5636360329510388
And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities,    1.5636360329510388
and houses (in the House Plan Association) that have good    1.5636360329510388
news to impart. These announcements are, in effect, advertisements    1.5127085093302464
for themselves as thriving marriage marts. There are boxed proclamations    1.5636360329510388
in the newspaper of watchings, pinnings, ringings, engagements, and    1.5127085093302464
marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity. "Witt House    1.5636360329510388
happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz    1.5636360329510388
of Fife House".   The Brooklyn College student shows    1.4513752902486308
some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models. The Ivy    1.5127085093302464
League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are as likely to    1.67495327387791
dress in rather foppish Continental fashion, or even in nondescript    1.5636360329510388
working class manner, as they are in the restrained, button-down Ivy    1.6065767145351917
way. The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts    1.67495327387791
out of town, and eye shadow, mascara, and elaborate <bouffant>    1.5636360329510388
hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel-    1.4513752902486308
are not unknown even in early morning classes.   Among the    1.5636360329510388
boys, there is very little bravado about drinking. Brooklyn College    1.5636360329510388
is distinctive for not having an official drinking place. The Fort Lauderdale    1.6432600607208703
encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College    1.5127085093302464
boys.    1.0
This should be used frequently (but shaken before using). For galled    1.6065767145351917
breasts, the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard    1.67495327387791
enough white chalk to make a paste. This could also be used for any    1.7026049541338664
other skin irritation. Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for    1.6432600607208703
a short time and then apply this under her breasts.   "Female    1.6065767145351917
troubles" of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the    1.67495327387791
frontier; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind    1.67495327387791
in my collection, one for hastening delayed menstruation. The sufferer    1.5636360329510388
drinks tansy tea.   Bruises, burns, cuts, etc&, occurred frequently    1.5127085093302464
on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers to these    1.6065767145351917
problems too. Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of    1.6065767145351917
raw beefsteak. (Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness    1.7026049541338664
of the applications which relieved the pain.) Salted butter was    1.5636360329510388
another    1.0
cure for bruises. Many people agreed that burns should be treated    1.6065767145351917
with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard, but one informant    1.6432600607208703
told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed    1.7026049541338664
watery fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed by    1.6432600607208703
bathing it with epsom salts. Another swore by vinegar baths for burns,    1.6432600607208703
and still another recommended salted butter. "Butter salve" or    1.5127085093302464
"butter ointment" was used for burns, and for bruises as well. This    1.6432600607208703
was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil;    1.7269387314284994
when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and bottled. Cow's    1.6432600607208703
milk was another cure for burns, and burns covered with gum arabic or    1.67495327387791
plain mucilage healed quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and    1.6432600607208703
eyes by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not find a doctor    1.7026049541338664
at the time. A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings,    1.6432600607208703
which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat".    1.7026049541338664
Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results    1.6065767145351917
were good, but which treatment helped is still not known.   To    1.6065767145351917
stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds. One old-timer    1.6065767145351917
said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut, even when on a knuckle, if it    1.7269387314284994
was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent    1.7026049541338664
infection. My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy    1.6432600607208703
for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury    1.6432600607208703
and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth, over which she poured    1.6432600607208703
turpentine. He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically    1.6432600607208703
amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar    1.6432600607208703
showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw" of tobacco put    1.6065767145351917
on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing. Or a thin slice    1.67495327387791
of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing. One    1.67495327387791
old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a    1.7850786258589375
fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his    1.7026049541338664
head. His brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached    1.67495327387791
the boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the scalp back    1.7026049541338664
in place, and covered the raw edges with the slices. Then he put a rag    1.7269387314284994
around the dressing to keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further    1.7026049541338664
care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no    1.67495327387791
scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding,    1.6432600607208703
and rue was an antiseptic. Until quite recently, "sterile" maggots    1.5636360329510388
could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface,    1.7026049541338664
leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.   Tetanus    1.6065767145351917
could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound. One family    1.6432600607208703
bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips, or, if these were not    1.67495327387791
handy, plain lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the    1.6432600607208703
wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were cured or prevented    1.6432600607208703
by "madstones" which the pioneer wore or carried. In 1872 there were    1.6432600607208703
known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the    1.67495327387791
family for 200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds,    1.67495327387791
then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.   While nowadays    1.6065767145351917
we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at    1.6432600607208703
the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had    1.67495327387791
little    1.0
variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused it, a cold pack    1.67495327387791
was usually first aid. This might be applied to the top of the nose    1.7026049541338664
or the back of the neck, pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the    1.7269387314284994
nostril (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could be    1.6065767145351917
stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and    1.6432600607208703
tying in it a knot for each year of his life. Or the victim could chew    1.748515906000203
hard on a piece of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in    1.6432600607208703
his ears.   Old sores could be healed by the constant application    1.6065767145351917
of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood blisters could    1.67495327387791
be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with    1.6065767145351917
any hard nonpoisonous substance. Felons were cured by taking common    1.5636360329510388
salt and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing it with equal    1.7269387314284994
parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on    1.6065767145351917
a cloth and wrapped around the affected part. As the cloth dried, more    1.67495327387791
of the mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the felon was    1.6432600607208703
supposed to be "killed".   Insect bites were cured in many    1.5636360329510388
ways. Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; "get a bite,    1.6432600607208703
spit on it" was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow    1.67495327387791
clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings;    1.67495327387791
not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular. Chiggers were a    1.6065767145351917
common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so    1.6065767145351917
small as to be scarcely visible to the eye, they buried themselves in    1.67495327387791
the victim's flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief    1.6065767145351917
and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased by applying liquid    1.6432600607208703
bluing. For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half    1.7026049541338664
a glass of soda was made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by    1.67495327387791
scraping an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to bathe the    1.67495327387791
painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well    1.6432600607208703
as soap. Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve    1.7269387314284994
wasp or bee stings.   Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days;    1.6432600607208703
to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore. Bed    1.7026049541338664
slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were placed in cups    1.67495327387791
of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate,    1.6065767145351917
applied with a feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding    1.5636360329510388
pioneer homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice in their    1.67495327387791
hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment, but it did the    1.6432600607208703
job.   To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should    1.6065767145351917
be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be removed from the    1.67495327387791
eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye. As the seed swelled its glutinous    1.7026049541338664
covering protected the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder    1.5636360329510388
and the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove small    1.67495327387791
objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle    1.67495327387791
would then move toward the nose, where it could be wiped out with    1.67495327387791
a wisp of cotton.   Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug,    1.6432600607208703
used in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and    1.6432600607208703
one    1.0
ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth. Itching    1.6432600607208703
skin, considered "just nerves", was eased by treating with    1.5127085093302464
whiskey and salt. Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider    1.6432600607208703
in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To cure fungus growths    1.6065767145351917
on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of    1.7026049541338664
sassafras bark in a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning    1.7269387314284994
and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same    1.67495327387791
solution. Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and    1.6065767145351917
had defied other remedies. Frostbite was treated by putting the feet    1.6065767145351917
and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one hears that    1.7269387314284994
heat and hot water are used instead. Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus,    1.67495327387791
used as well for chilblains. Chilblains were also treated with    1.5636360329510388
tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.   Boils have always been    1.5636360329510388
a source of much trouble. A German informant gave me a sure cure    1.67495327387791
made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice    1.6432600607208703
was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped in water    1.67495327387791
until it formed a sticky, gummy solution. This was also used for sores.    1.67495327387791
Another frequent pioneer difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy    1.5636360329510388
shoes and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me she has    1.6432600607208703
used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they    1.7026049541338664
remove the pain or "fire". Another common cure was to soak the    1.6432600607208703
feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of    1.7026049541338664
equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight.    1.67495327387791
This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed    1.7026049541338664
the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.   1.7026049541338664
There were many cures for warts. One young girl told me how her    1.67495327387791
mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in    1.67495327387791
vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several    1.67495327387791
times. Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a    1.6432600607208703
bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the    1.7269387314284994
house for seven days. Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's    1.6432600607208703
sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on    1.6065767145351917
wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear    1.7026049541338664
after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did    1.6065767145351917
just that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy.    1.748515906000203
Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie    1.6432600607208703
it on the wart, and wear it for a week. A simpler method was to tie    1.748515906000203
a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way. I    1.7269387314284994
know this worked. One person recommended to me washing the wart with    1.6432600607208703
sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato    1.6432600607208703
three times daily. Another common method was to cut an onion in two and    1.7026049541338664
place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened    1.7026049541338664
together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave. As the    1.6065767145351917
onion decayed, so did the wart.   Sore muscles were relieved by    1.6065767145351917
an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's    1.6432600607208703
ubiquitous herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water    1.7026049541338664
in which two cups of salt had been dissolved. Leg cramps, one person    1.67495327387791
tells me, were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the    1.6432600607208703
body on the heel and pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I    1.7026049541338664
can testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy    1.6065767145351917
before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in the back of the leg and in    1.7269387314284994
the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope    1.67495327387791
about the patient's waist.   For sprains and swellings, one    1.5127085093302464
pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added    1.67495327387791
to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.   1.6065767145351917
EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable    1.6065767145351917
plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock    1.5636360329510388
the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper    1.67495327387791
or <negociant> who in turn supplies him. In instances where    1.5636360329510388
both of these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation is ideal.    1.67495327387791
It may, on occasion, be anything but that. However, by cultivating    1.6065767145351917
a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain    1.6432600607208703
whether he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he may    1.67495327387791
have been told by salesmen and promoters) and, better yet, whether he    1.6432600607208703
has a taste for wine. Again, by spreading one's purchases over several    1.6432600607208703
wine dealers, one becomes familiar with the names and specialties    1.5636360329510388
of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This is important because,    1.6065767145351917
despite all the efforts of the French government, an appreciable    1.5636360329510388
segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a    1.6432600607208703
misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many    1.4513752902486308
too many <negociants> who would rather turn a <sou> than amass a    1.6432600607208703
creditable reputation overseas.   A good <negociant> or shipper    1.4513752902486308
will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from    1.7269387314284994
the best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also be the    1.7026049541338664
one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards    1.6432600607208703
generally in his own district. These are the wines the French themselves    1.6432600607208703
use for everyday drinking, for even in France virtually no one    1.6065767145351917
drinks the <Grands Crus> on a meal-to-meal basis. The <Grands    1.5636360329510388
Crus> are expensive, and even doting palates tire of them. And certainly,    1.6432600607208703
in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine    1.6065767145351917
drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready    1.6432600607208703
for the <Grands Crus> as a steady diet without frequent recourse    1.6065767145351917
to <crus> of less renown. There is nothing <infra dig> about a    1.6432600607208703
good blend from a good shipper. Some of them are very delicious indeed,    1.67495327387791
and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately, along with    1.5636360329510388
others not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable wine dealer    1.6432600607208703
and constant experimentation- "steering ever from the known to    1.5127085093302464
the unknown"- are the requisites.   Wine waiters are something    1.5127085093302464
else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great    1.6432600607208703
deal, their importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate    1.6065767145351917
on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and    1.6432600607208703
some other Latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty    1.6065767145351917
of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof    1.6065767145351917
on the customer himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!)    1.6432600607208703
is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly, if everyone    1.6432600607208703
in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them, the    1.67495327387791
supply would dry up in no time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating,    1.748515906000203
argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible    1.5636360329510388
attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine waiter is,    1.6432600607208703
paradoxically, the guardian (and not the purveyor) of his cellar against    1.6065767145351917
the Visigoths. Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible    1.6065767145351917
supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped    1.7026049541338664
with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine    1.6065767145351917
waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence. The one way to    1.6065767145351917
get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking    1.6432600607208703
to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter    1.6432600607208703
is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending    1.7026049541338664
money. Only then, perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.   1.6432600607208703
Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest    1.6065767145351917
for several weeks before it is served. This is especially true of    1.6432600607208703
red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well    1.6432600607208703
worth the effort. It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter    1.748515906000203
of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal. Wine stored    1.7026049541338664
for a long time should be on its side; otherwise, the cork dries    1.67495327387791
and air enters to spoil it. When stacking wine on its side in a bin,    1.7269387314284994
care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next    1.7269387314284994
to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling    1.67495327387791
around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard    1.7269387314284994
or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture.    1.67495327387791
Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again with ill effects.    1.67495327387791
The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine (provided the eye    1.6432600607208703
has not already spotted it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after    1.7269387314284994
pulling it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right;    1.67495327387791
if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.   Seasonal    1.6065767145351917
rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely.    1.67495327387791
The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five    1.5636360329510388
degrees, with an allowable range of five degrees above or below    1.6065767145351917
this, provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged vibration    1.6065767145351917
is also undesirable; consequently, one's wine closet or cellar    1.5127085093302464
should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces. If    1.5636360329510388
one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have    1.7026049541338664
one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time.    1.7026049541338664
Light, especially daylight, is always bad for wine.   All in    1.5636360329510388
all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations    1.67495327387791
thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go    1.5127085093302464
to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without    1.6065767145351917
further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious    1.6065767145351917
cork. No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure    1.6432600607208703
they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning    1.6432600607208703
is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree    1.7026049541338664
of purism! But the fact remains that in most restaurants, including    1.6065767145351917
some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle    1.6432600607208703
is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered,    1.67495327387791
and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place    1.6065767145351917
while the chef is preparing the meal. A white wine, already at cool    1.67495327387791
cellar temperature, may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and    1.6432600607208703
water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the former is far    1.6432600607208703
preferable) in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter    1.6432600607208703
climate, there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow. Though    1.67495327387791
by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought    1.67495327387791
from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so    1.67495327387791
before serving time. It may be a bit cold when poured; but again,    1.67495327387791
as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should    1.67495327387791
be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is never filled more    1.6432600607208703
than half full. In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly-    1.67495327387791
and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste    1.7026049541338664
and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or the course), in    1.67495327387791
the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting    1.67495327387791
stages. The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming    1.6065767145351917
a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an    1.7850786258589375
open fire. This invariably effaces any wine's character, and drives    1.5636360329510388
its fragrance underground.   It should not be forgotten that    1.5127085093302464
wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly    1.6065767145351917
in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams,    1.5636360329510388
Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively. Very old red wines    1.4513752902486308
often require several hours of aeration, and any red wine, brought from    1.6432600607208703
the cellar within half an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed    1.67495327387791
some air. But white wines never! White wines should be opened    1.6065767145351917
when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their    1.5636360329510388
sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse    1.6065767145351917
or a Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted    1.5636360329510388
method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white    1.67495327387791
wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving    1.67495327387791
a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive.    1.5636360329510388
The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death    1.67495327387791
when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air. To quote    1.748515906000203
Professor Saintsbury: "The last glass of claret or Burgundy    1.5127085093302464
is as good as the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem    1.67495327387791
or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This does not    1.67495327387791
mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there    1.6065767145351917
is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or    1.67495327387791
the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good. If    1.7026049541338664
this must be done, they should always be corked and kept in a cool place;    1.7269387314284994
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably    1.5636360329510388
shorter than those of milk.   A few red wines, notably those    1.6065767145351917
of the Beaujolais, are better consumed at cellar temperature. By    1.5636360329510388
tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-    1.6065767145351917
if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin    1.6432600607208703
and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well. Thus,    1.67495327387791
red wine must, if possible, never be disturbed or shaken; very old    1.6432600607208703
red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which    1.6432600607208703
have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself.    1.67495327387791
A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may    1.6065767145351917
do as much harm as a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually    1.7269387314284994
and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.   Many    1.6065767145351917
people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully    1.6432600607208703
from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without    1.6432600607208703
disturbing the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and    1.6065767145351917
insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand    1.67495327387791
on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom,    1.7269387314284994
after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position    1.6432600607208703
on its side in the cradle.   In France, when one wishes to entertain    1.67495327387791
at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the    1.67495327387791
restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice    1.6432600607208703
of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them. The wine    1.67495327387791
waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened    1.7269387314284994
at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on    1.67495327387791
end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines,    1.7269387314284994
be decanted. Decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be-    1.6432600607208703
practically speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process    1.6065767145351917
of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead of several    1.6065767145351917
or more times at the table: hence, a minimum of the undesirable mixture    1.67495327387791
of wine and dregs.   Though there are many exceptions, which    1.5636360329510388
we have noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best consumed    1.7026049541338664
between two and six years old, and red wines, nowadays, between three    1.6432600607208703
and ten. Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep    1.7026049541338664
longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite    1.5636360329510388
number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into their own until    1.6432600607208703
they are ten or fifteen years of age, or even more. If a red Bordeaux    1.7269387314284994
of a good name and year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting,    1.7026049541338664
leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais, on    1.67495327387791
the other hand, <should> be drunk while very young; and Alsatians    1.6065767145351917
<may> be.    1.0
Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest assured that    1.4513752902486308
your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter    1.5636360329510388
and Spirit strictly complied with **h and most particularly in regard    1.6065767145351917
to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane    1.7026049541338664
views".   Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.    1.5127085093302464
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's    1.7026049541338664
overseer. An excellent crop was expected that year.    1.4513752902486308
William,    1.0
who lived in neighboring St& Mary's parish, had taken charge and    1.6065767145351917
decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated    1.67495327387791
for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this plan, citing the    1.6065767145351917
depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions    1.6432600607208703
at the plantation. If sold then, the land and improvements might    1.6065767145351917
bring only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference with    1.6432600607208703
Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning of Gorham's    1.6065767145351917
intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother.    1.5127085093302464
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs,    1.6432600607208703
he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless    1.67495327387791
Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation,    1.6065767145351917
and Louisiana law required their removal from the state. Gorham    1.5636360329510388
refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how    1.6432600607208703
much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the    1.6065767145351917
North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was    1.6065767145351917
not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes    1.6432600607208703
who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid    1.7026049541338664
his annoyance, although both he and William were furious with their    1.6065767145351917
Yankee brother. William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen    1.6065767145351917
that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would    1.7026049541338664
sue "amicably" to protect his interests.   Palfrey was    1.4513752902486308
determined    1.0
that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers    1.6065767145351917
during the transition period before emancipation. If William wished    1.5127085093302464
to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes    1.6432600607208703
undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there as are ever    1.67495327387791
paid the labor of persons of their sex + age. A disposition to exert    1.67495327387791
themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them    1.67495327387791
**h to come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our plantation    1.67495327387791
+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement". When he heard    1.6065767145351917
of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could    1.6065767145351917
be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was willing    1.7026049541338664
to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block    1.6432600607208703
his ultimate aim. William was adamant on one point: under no circumstances    1.6432600607208703
would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his    1.6432600607208703
and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom. Knowing    1.6432600607208703
the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the    1.5127085093302464
number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them    1.5636360329510388
to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific    1.67495327387791
instructions, he agreed to William's condition.   In March    1.4513752902486308
there was a division of the slaves, and Giffen carried out his instructions    1.67495327387791
as nearly as possible. Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded    1.5636360329510388
in getting a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered    1.67495327387791
that your views would be best carried out", he explained,    1.5636360329510388
"by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend    1.67495327387791
the philantrophy of Emancipation. I have also taken the old servants    1.6065767145351917
of your father as a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages    1.6065767145351917
of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to    1.6432600607208703
an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the    1.6432600607208703
wickedness of slavery, they were put aside after he received an inventory    1.6432600607208703
of the slave property he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human    1.6432600607208703
worth in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity, was all    1.6432600607208703
he needed. Each human being, known only by a given name, had a cash value.    1.7269387314284994
Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150;    1.5636360329510388
Rose, a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential, was worth $400.    1.5127085093302464
In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey    1.6432600607208703
was giving up close to $7,000.   Palfrey's brothers each received    1.5636360329510388
lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed    1.6065767145351917
that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus twenty "black    1.6432600607208703
souls" were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land    1.6432600607208703
of free men. Giffen extracted one concession from William: the house    1.6065767145351917
servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.   1.5636360329510388
Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans for freeing    1.5127085093302464
his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he could get the necessary approval,    1.67495327387791
fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special    1.5636360329510388
permission. According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty    1.67495327387791
years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned the state legislature    1.6432600607208703
to waive the requirement. Otherwise, freedom would mean removal    1.5127085093302464
from the state in which "as the place of their past residence from    1.67495327387791
birth, or for many years, it would **h be materially for their advantage    1.67495327387791
to be at liberty to remain". On March 11 the Louisiana legislature    1.6432600607208703
voted unanimously to table the petition. News of the legislative    1.5636360329510388
veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William    1.6065767145351917
became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt    1.7026049541338664
in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of    1.6065767145351917
the New Orleans <Courier,> shouting that the emancipation scheme    1.5127085093302464
had become a public affair, and that it would reach the "Ears of the    1.7026049541338664
People on the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".   1.5127085093302464
His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had    1.5636360329510388
imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves, and to keep    1.67495327387791
the family from falling apart over the issue. When Giffen decided    1.6065767145351917
to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily    1.6432600607208703
assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers    1.6432600607208703
would never have any cause to complain of him.   in view of these    1.67495327387791
difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana. Giffen had already    1.5636360329510388
urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters.    1.7269387314284994
His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him    1.5127085093302464
to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April. Palfrey    1.6065767145351917
told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New    1.7026049541338664
Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence    1.4513752902486308
that he might be allowed to see his family again.   During his journey    1.67495327387791
Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists. In both cases he    1.6065767145351917
desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived    1.6065767145351917
in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed him    1.6065767145351917
enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from the Legislature    1.5636360329510388
of Louisiana, and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood    1.6432600607208703
of man". Mrs& Child, who had once apologized for sending    1.5636360329510388
editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one    1.67495327387791
of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before,    1.5636360329510388
but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana. She agreed to    1.67495327387791
take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send    1.7026049541338664
them north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey consulted    1.4513752902486308
with Cassius M& Clay on the same subject, but with no apparent    1.6432600607208703
result.   Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety,    1.4513752902486308
Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial. Instead    1.5636360329510388
of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature of his mission,    1.6065767145351917
he received many calling cards and invitations from "gentlemen of mark,    1.6065767145351917
on whom I had no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations    1.67495327387791
than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of    1.6065767145351917
the "marked attention and civility" with which the New Orleans    1.5636360329510388
gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him. The memory of this southern    1.6432600607208703
hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years    1.5636360329510388
and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic    1.4513752902486308
account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas,    1.6065767145351917
"many of whom were coarse + passionate people, much excited by what    1.6065767145351917
they heard of my plans". He proceeded with his task bravely- in    1.6432600607208703
his memoirs, at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should    1.6065767145351917
have time to boil too high".   Palfrey had already made up his    1.6432600607208703
mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely    1.7026049541338664
whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by remaining behind    1.67495327387791
condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage. He had a    1.6065767145351917
short private talk with each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey    1.6432600607208703
soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others. All the    1.67495327387791
slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure    1.6432600607208703
until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in "their    1.7026049541338664
own little produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain    1.5636360329510388
as wage laborers for his account. William's threat that under    1.5636360329510388
no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious" slaves to mix with    1.5636360329510388
his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation    1.6432600607208703
as before. Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to    1.5127085093302464
have made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience".   1.6065767145351917
From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest    1.3761581156320553
in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time for their departure    1.7026049541338664
approached, his solicitousness increased. Should any slave change    1.4513752902486308
his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage    1.6432600607208703
at once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally    1.6065767145351917
established,    1.0
Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters    1.5636360329510388
in New Orleans and aboard ship. Giffen assured him that the captain    1.6432600607208703
and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration.    1.6432600607208703
Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage    1.5636360329510388
to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation was sold in January,    1.67495327387791
1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people    1.6432600607208703
two months' wages. Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation    1.5636360329510388
for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined to    1.6065767145351917
enter into any philanthropic arrangement.   On March 21, 1845 the    1.5636360329510388
bark <Bashaw> weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee    1.6065767145351917
Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former    1.5636360329510388
chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled    1.6432600607208703
regret and jubilation.   Not all of Palfrey's slaves were    1.5127085093302464
aboard the <Bashaw>. Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult    1.67495327387791
to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants. Two of    1.6065767145351917
these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen filed a petition for    1.6065767145351917
permission to emancipate four slaves (all more than fifty years old)    1.6065767145351917
with the St& Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection,    1.6065767145351917
which he attributed to a "general Excitement against Abolition    1.5127085093302464
and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right individuals on the    1.5127085093302464
jury, and got the permission without further delay.   When the    1.5636360329510388
Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were, of course, no longer    1.67495327387791
slaves. Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of    1.5636360329510388
the constitution of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and    1.6432600607208703
equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's    1.5127085093302464
Chapel to formalize the emancipation. An eyewitness recalled    1.4513752902486308
how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed    1.5636360329510388
in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed    1.6065767145351917
while they listened to the few words that declared them free.   1.6065767145351917
Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction,    1.5636360329510388
he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes    1.6432600607208703
as servants. Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in    1.6065767145351917
the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts.    1.6432600607208703
Mrs& Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children    1.67495327387791
with a Quaker    1.0
family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York.    1.3761581156320553
This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was    1.5636360329510388
in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.   1.7026049541338664
But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a    1.5636360329510388
group more varied in background and interest. Secretary of State Dean    1.6065767145351917
Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean, has headed    1.6065767145351917
the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for    1.6065767145351917
international cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office    1.5636360329510388
was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first    1.6432600607208703
Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs.    1.5127085093302464
("In the late forties and fifties", Coombs has declared in defining    1.6065767145351917
his role, "two strong new arms were added to reinforce United    1.6065767145351917
States foreign policy **h economic assistance and military assistance.    1.5127085093302464
As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity **h to build    1.67495327387791
a third strong arm, aimed at the development of people, at the fuller    1.67495327387791
realization of their creative human potential, and at better understanding    1.5636360329510388
among them".)   Many of the new appointees are art collectors.    1.5636360329510388
Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital    1.4513752902486308
with a collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin,    1.5636360329510388
Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and    1.3761581156320553
Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps, R& Sargent Shriver,    1.6065767145351917
Jr&, a Kennedy brother-in-law, collects heavily among the moderns,    1.5127085093302464
including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury    1.5636360329510388
Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet, <Femmes dans un jardin>.   1.5636360329510388
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President    1.3761581156320553
of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation different from    1.6065767145351917
that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson,    1.5636360329510388
who had been head of General Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at    1.6065767145351917
times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara    1.5127085093302464
is the scholar-businessman. An inveterate reader of books, he chose    1.5636360329510388
while working in Detroit to live in the University community of    1.6065767145351917
Ann Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller of    1.6065767145351917
Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former Rhodes Scholar, Charles    1.6065767145351917
Hitch, who is author of a study on <The Economics of Defense    1.6432600607208703
in the Nuclear Age>.   One of the President's special assistants,    1.5636360329510388
the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry    1.5127085093302464
L& Stimson of the latter's classic memoir, <On Active Service>.    1.5636360329510388
Another, Arthur M& Schlesinger, Jr&, has won a Pulitzer    1.5127085093302464
Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter. The    1.6065767145351917
Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy as a pianist.    1.6065767145351917
("It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who **h neither    1.7026049541338664
know nor understand music", he declared not long ago in proposing    1.6065767145351917
that White House prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs& Arthur    1.6432600607208703
Goldberg, wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally    1.5127085093302464
and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District    1.5636360329510388
of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a new frontier", she claims.    1.6065767145351917
"In fact, the search is almost more important than the find".)    1.6065767145351917
Mrs& Henry Labouisse, wife of the new director of the foreign    1.6065767145351917
aid program, is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.   The list    1.6065767145351917
goes on. At last count, sixteen former Rhodes Scholars (see box on    1.6432600607208703
page 13) had been appointed to the Administration, second in number    1.6065767145351917
only to its Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice Department's    1.5636360329510388
Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has won a Pulitzer    1.4513752902486308
Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster General J& Edward    1.4513752902486308
Day, who must deal with matters of postal censorship, is himself    1.6065767145351917
author of a novel, <Bartholf Street,> albeit one he was obliged to    1.6432600607208703
publish    1.0
at his own expense.   Two men show promise of playing prominent    1.6065767145351917
roles:   William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has    1.2818970554302986
been a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in Washington    1.6065767145351917
about the same time during the early postwar years: Kennedy as the    1.6432600607208703
young Congressman from Massachusetts; Walton, after a wartime stint    1.5127085093302464
with <Time-Life>, to become bureau chief for the <New Republic>.    1.5636360329510388
Both lived in Georgetown, were unattached, and shared an active    1.5636360329510388
social life. Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become    1.6432600607208703
one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters, vows that he    1.5636360329510388
and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days. Nonetheless, they    1.6065767145351917
found common interests. During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked    1.5127085093302464
Walton, an utter novice in organization politics, to assist him.    1.5636360329510388
Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the    1.6065767145351917
hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted    1.6065767145351917
to be liaison officer to critically important New York City.   1.5636360329510388
Walton, who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's    1.5636360329510388
paratroopers during the invasion of France, combines the soul    1.5127085093302464
of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials    1.7026049541338664
when, after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House    1.5127085093302464
with Mrs& Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased the    1.6065767145351917
joint to see what was there". But his credentials are impeccable.    1.6065767145351917
Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise    1.6432600607208703
on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the    1.6432600607208703
renovation of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will continue    1.6432600607208703
to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter, strictly ex    1.5636360329510388
officio, for culture.   A more official representative is the Secretary    1.5636360329510388
of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon    1.6065767145351917
first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken man with a lust    1.6065767145351917
for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight.    1.7026049541338664
But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians, he displays    1.5636360329510388
a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments.    1.5636360329510388
His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals    1.6432600607208703
such as C& P& Snow, Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.   1.5636360329510388
Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great    1.5127085093302464
deal more than dams and wildlife preserves. After promoting Frost's    1.5636360329510388
appearance at the Inauguration, he persuaded the poet to return    1.5636360329510388
several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet    1.67495327387791
members, members of Congress, and other Washington notables gathered    1.5127085093302464
in the State Department auditorium. The event was so successful    1.5636360329510388
that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar    1.6065767145351917
ones from time to time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment    1.67495327387791
of the Administration.   His Ideas in this respect, however,    1.5127085093302464
sometimes arouse critical response. One tempest was stirred up last    1.5636360329510388
March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue    1.5127085093302464
of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum,    1.5636360329510388
would be sent "on indefinite loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's    1.5636360329510388
birthplace. Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors    1.3761581156320553
promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his    1.6065767145351917
own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech he had made two    1.7269387314284994
years earlier as a Congressman, decrying the more than two hundred    1.6065767145351917
statues, monuments, and memorials which "dot the Washington landscape    1.5127085093302464
**h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching    1.5636360329510388
new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall had proposed    1.6432600607208703
that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.   1.67495327387791
He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the    1.6065767145351917
case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce    1.6432600607208703
that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no    1.6432600607208703
desire to "hustle" it out of Washington. The last Congress adopted    1.6065767145351917
seven bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko,    1.5127085093302464
the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced. Active    1.5127085093302464
warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first    1.67495327387791
Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac, and T&    1.5636360329510388
R&'s own living children, who wish to preserve the island as    1.6065767145351917
a wildlife sanctuary. The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin    1.6065767145351917
D& Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved with    1.5636360329510388
his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its critics, "Instant    1.6065767145351917
Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's headaches, since as supervisor    1.5127085093302464
of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility    1.6065767145351917
for building it.   "Washington", President Kennedy    1.2818970554302986
has been heard to remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency    1.6432600607208703
and northern charm". There have been indications that he hopes    1.5636360329510388
to redress that situation, commencing with the White House. One of    1.6065767145351917
Mrs& Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state    1.6065767145351917
of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national    1.67495327387791
shrine. Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture    1.6065767145351917
assembled by President Thomas Jefferson, the White House has collected    1.5636360329510388
a hodgepodge of period pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.   1.6065767145351917
Mrs& Kennedy shows a determination to change all this.    1.5127085093302464
Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk, hewed from    1.7026049541338664
the timbers of the British ship H&M&S& <Resolute> and    1.5127085093302464
presented to    1.0
President Hayes by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President    1.5636360329510388
in his oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the    1.6432600607208703
<Gazette des Beaux-Arts,> she found a description of a handsome gilt    1.6065767145351917
pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe. She traced    1.5636360329510388
it to a storage room. With its coating of gold radiator paint removed-    1.67495327387791
a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its    1.6065767145351917
rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White    1.7026049541338664
House.   But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century    1.6065767145351917
furniture (which Mrs& Kennedy feels is the proper period    1.5127085093302464
for    1.0
the White House) must be pursued in places other than government storage    1.6432600607208703
rooms.    1.0
The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee    1.5127085093302464
for the White House, to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange    1.67495327387791
ways to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living Presidents    1.67495327387791
on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes    1.5636360329510388
no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee, headed by Henry    1.6065767145351917
Francis Du Pont, contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats.   1.6065767145351917
The press releases emanating from the White House give    1.5127085093302464
a clue to the activity within. A curator has been appointed. A valuable    1.67495327387791
pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore    1.4513752902486308
Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein    1.5636360329510388
and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute    1.5636360329510388
of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library. Secretary    1.5636360329510388
and Mrs& Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire    1.5127085093302464
furniture, including Dolley Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room    1.5636360329510388
in that style. And part of a fabulous collection of <vermeil> hollowware,    1.6432600607208703
bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs& Margaret    1.5636360329510388
Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display    1.7026049541338664
in the State dining room.   Woman's place is in the home:    1.6065767145351917
man must attend to matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems    1.67495327387791
to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just    1.5636360329510388
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Congress had    1.5127085093302464
already appropriated money, and plans were well along to tear down the    1.6432600607208703
buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one    1.5636360329510388
critic calls the "marble monumentality" of government office buildings.    1.5127085093302464
While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to    1.5636360329510388
preserve the Belasco Theater, as well as the Dolley Madison and the    1.6432600607208703
Benjamin Taylor houses, all scheduled for razing.   What to    1.5127085093302464
do about it now that he was President? Only a few days after moving    1.7026049541338664
into the White House. Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square.    1.6432600607208703
Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem    1.6432600607208703
to him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided it    1.6432600607208703
didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.   The situation    1.5127085093302464
involved some political perils. One of the offices slated for reconstruction    1.6065767145351917
is the aged Court of Claims, diagonally across the street    1.5636360329510388
from the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown. But    1.6065767145351917
Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court, is an elderly    1.6065767145351917
gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk    1.6432600607208703
to work. More importantly, he also happens to be the brother-in-law    1.6065767145351917
of Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.   There were aesthetic    1.5636360329510388
problems as well as political. On delving deeper, Walton discovered    1.5636360329510388
that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified    1.6065767145351917
as "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over which many    1.5636360329510388
people had grown sentimental, was only a shell of its former self    1.6432600607208703
after arduous years as a ~USO Center. The Dolley Madison House,    1.6065767145351917
Walton concluded, was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt    1.4513752902486308
to save the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half a    1.6065767145351917
century too late".    1.0
Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious and beautiful. The    1.6065767145351917
buildings are mostly Georgian. The Dartmouth student does not live    1.5636360329510388
in monastic seclusion, as he once did. But his is still a simple life    1.7026049541338664
relatively free of the female presence or influence, and he must go    1.6432600607208703
far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated pleasures. He is    1.6432600607208703
still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence, if he chooses to be.   1.7269387314284994
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the    1.7026049541338664
last century, down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal    1.7269387314284994
for book learning in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's    1.6065767145351917
Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven.    1.6065767145351917
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend,    1.5636360329510388
toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke, are no less rakish than    1.6432600607208703
those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia. But there has    1.5127085093302464
always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate    1.5636360329510388
and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment. No one    1.6065767145351917
here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie    1.7026049541338664
probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League. It even affects    1.5636360329510388
the faculty.   Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival-    1.3761581156320553
widely recognized as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend    1.5127085093302464
anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup,    1.5636360329510388
Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter    1.6065767145351917
garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been    1.6065767145351917
acquired from a Smith girl. President Dickey's golden retriever,    1.5127085093302464
frolicking in the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine    1.67495327387791
informality.   This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up    1.4513752902486308
again in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour, wearing    1.5636360329510388
ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival.    1.6065767145351917
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown    1.7026049541338664
on her head. So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.   1.6432600607208703
Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal    1.4513752902486308
<sang-froid>. For example, groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut    1.5127085093302464
River. This is in honor of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped    1.67495327387791
a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in    1.7269387314284994
his own student days. And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated    1.6065767145351917
today. They are hailed by the nation's press, and Smith girls throng    1.6432600607208703
the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the <voyageurs> with    1.5127085093302464
hot soup and kisses.   Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic    1.5127085093302464
recreation is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand    1.5636360329510388
pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United    1.6065767145351917
States, the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team    1.5636360329510388
as another name for their own. Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant    1.6432600607208703
member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union, which includes the winter    1.5636360329510388
sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country.   Dartmouth    1.6432600607208703
students ski everywhere in winter, starting with their own front    1.5636360329510388
door. They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him, or move    1.67495327387791
out to Oak Hill, where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway,    1.6065767145351917
at Holt's Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the best    1.7026049541338664
terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.   Forty    1.5636360329510388
miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's own mountain.    1.5127085093302464
Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President Dickey acts as host every    1.6065767145351917
year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth    1.67495327387791
Outing Club to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn    1.6432600607208703
virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining, sleeping, or    1.5636360329510388
lounging in its huge living room. The Outing Club also owns a chain    1.67495327387791
of fourteen cabins and several shelters, extending from the Vermont    1.5636360329510388
hills, just across the river from the college, through Hanover to the    1.6432600607208703
College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in    1.6065767145351917
the logging country. The cabins are equipped with bunks, blankets,    1.5636360329510388
and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips.    1.6432600607208703
The club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of the students    1.67495327387791
prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting,    1.67495327387791
fishing, climbing, or skiing.   Under the auspices of the Outing    1.5636360329510388
Club, Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes    1.5127085093302464
on tough climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose interests    1.6065767145351917
are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's Team, which    1.5127085093302464
competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and    1.5636360329510388
chopping,    1.0
canoe races, and the like.   There is much to be said for a college    1.7026049541338664
that, while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives    1.5636360329510388
its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along    1.7026049541338664
back roads where a glimpse of small game, deer, or even bear is not    1.7026049541338664
uncommon. City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle    1.7269387314284994
or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly in a backwoods    1.7026049541338664
logging camp. And on the summit of Mount Washington, where thirty-five    1.6065767145351917
degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered    1.6065767145351917
higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of wisdom    1.67495327387791
to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas "because    1.6432600607208703
it is there".   There is much to be said for such a college-    1.67495327387791
and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too    1.67495327387791
loudly. Their affection for their college home has even caused President    1.6065767145351917
Dickey to comment on this "place loyalty" as something rather    1.5636360329510388
specially Hanoverian.   Probably a lawyer once said it best for    1.5636360329510388
all time in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in the    1.67495327387791
nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about    1.5636360329510388
for a way to found its own state university. It fixed on Dartmouth College,    1.7026049541338664
which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered. The    1.5636360329510388
legislators decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war    1.5636360329510388
with the college trustees over the control of classrooms, faculty,    1.5636360329510388
and chapel. For a time there were two factions on the campus    1.6432600607208703
fighting for possession of the student body.   The struggle was    1.5636360329510388
resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing    1.67495327387791
cases in our judicial history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating    1.6432600607208703
the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters. A lawyer,    1.5636360329510388
hired by the college, was arguing specifically for Dartmouth:    1.5127085093302464
Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made her plight the dramatic focus    1.6065767145351917
of his whole plea. In an age of oratory, he was the king of orators,    1.7269387314284994
and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly    1.6432600607208703
tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax:   "It    1.5127085093302464
is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those    1.7026049541338664
who love it **h".   Dartmouth is today still a small college-    1.6065767145351917
and still a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.   This    1.5636360329510388
is not out of keeping with its origins, probably the most humble of    1.67495327387791
any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock, a Presbyterian minister,    1.5636360329510388
founded the school in 1769, naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth,    1.67495327387791
its sponsor and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain,    1.5636360329510388
found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands    1.6432600607208703
built the first College Hall, a log hut dedicated "for the education    1.6432600607208703
+ instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading,    1.6432600607208703
writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and    1.5636360329510388
expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children of Pagans as well    1.5127085093302464
as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth    1.6432600607208703
and any others".   It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's    1.5636360329510388
was indeed "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to    1.6432600607208703
be    1.0
hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to    1.5127085093302464
permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first    1.6432600607208703
Dartmouth commencement in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully    1.5636360329510388
brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still    1.5636360329510388
one of the cherished possessions of the college.   The exuberance    1.5636360329510388
on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings.    1.5636360329510388
A student orator "produced tears from a great number of the learned"    1.6432600607208703
even before the punch was served. Then from the branches of a    1.6432600607208703
near-by tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform and    1.5636360329510388
the English language, harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue.    1.5636360329510388
Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green    1.6065767145351917
beneath the three-hundred-foot pines, and a barrel of rum was broached.    1.6065767145351917
The cook got drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man    1.6432600607208703
of broad talents by carving the ox himself.   Future commencements    1.5636360329510388
were more decorous perhaps, but the number of graduates increased    1.5636360329510388
from the original four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the    1.7026049541338664
nineteenth    1.0
century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and Penn    1.5636360329510388
were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine.    1.5127085093302464
The dormitories, including the beloved Dartmouth Hall, could barely    1.5127085093302464
house two hundred students in Spartan fashion.   Then in 1893    1.5636360329510388
Dr& William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's    1.5127085093302464
great awakening began. He transformed Dartmouth from a small New    1.5636360329510388
Hampshire institution into a national college. By 1907 the number of    1.6065767145351917
undergraduates had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in    1.6065767145351917
that year, Dr& Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence    1.6065767145351917
of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the    1.6065767145351917
college. The presidents of Cornell, Wisconsin, C&C&N&Y&,    1.3761581156320553
Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard    1.4513752902486308
and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.   1.5636360329510388
Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today, with approximately    1.5636360329510388
twenty-nine hundred undergraduates. But it has achieved a    1.4513752902486308
cross-section of students from almost all the states, and two-thirds of    1.6065767145351917
its undergraduates come from outside New England. Over 450 different    1.5636360329510388
schools are usually represented in each entering class. Only a dozen    1.6065767145351917
or so schools send as many as six students, and there are seldom more    1.7026049541338664
than fifteen men in any single delegation. About two-thirds of the    1.6065767145351917
boys now come from public schools.   It is still a college only    1.6432600607208703
and not a university; it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy    1.7026049541338664
group. However, three distinguished associated graduate schools offer    1.4513752902486308
professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical School (third oldest    1.4513752902486308
in the country and founded in 1797), the Thayer School of Engineering,    1.6432600607208703
and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. All    1.5127085093302464
three are purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment of    1.6065767145351917
about two hundred.   All three schools coordinate their educational    1.5127085093302464
programs with that of the undergraduate college and, like the college    1.6065767145351917
proper,    1.0
place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation    1.6432600607208703
for specialized study. Students of the college who are candidates    1.5636360329510388
for the A&B& degree and can satisfy the academic requirements    1.5636360329510388
of the medical and business schools, may enter either of these associated    1.6432600607208703
schools at the beginning of senior year, thus completing the    1.5636360329510388
two-year postgraduate course in one year. The Thayer School offers    1.5636360329510388
a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins    1.7026049541338664
a B&S& in engineering.   So Dartmouth is moving closer    1.5127085093302464
to the others in the Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member    1.7026049541338664
of the League, if not in years at least in the catching up it has    1.7269387314284994
had to do. It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span    1.748515906000203
the other Ivies have enjoyed. However much football has been over-emphasized,    1.6065767145351917
the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by    1.5127085093302464
the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its record a thought again    1.67495327387791
since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth    1.67495327387791
had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national    1.6065767145351917
recognition.   It has come on with a rush in more significant areas.    1.6432600607208703
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions    1.6065767145351917
might consider somewhat breathtaking. But Dartmouth preserves    1.3761581156320553
its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes, and, although    1.5636360329510388
some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage, they    1.6432600607208703
make for lively copy.   President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed    1.5127085093302464
to corral an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover.    1.4513752902486308
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified. It was    1.67495327387791
a busy street, conveniently near the shopping center, and unattended    1.5636360329510388
horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.   There are,    1.6065767145351917
of course, many weaknesses in any case against Emma. She didn't like    1.6432600607208703
her stepmother, but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before    1.6065767145351917
the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had no    1.67495327387791
way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed.    1.6065767145351917
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized    1.7269387314284994
during her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy,    1.6432600607208703
the stableman might have recognized her. If police had checked on    1.6065767145351917
her more thoroughly than is indicated, she would be completely eliminated    1.6065767145351917
Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate    1.3761581156320553
popular suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden    1.5127085093302464
home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him,    1.7269387314284994
although he clearly intended to stay overnight, if not longer.   1.5636360329510388
Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were    1.6432600607208703
in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders, she had been    1.6432600607208703
disturbed by their voices and had closed her door, even though it was    1.67495327387791
a very hot day.   It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything    1.67495327387791
she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse. At that    1.6065767145351917
time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S& Phillips.    1.6065767145351917
A few years ago, not too long before his death, Phillips revealed    1.6432600607208703
in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders.    1.67495327387791
He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that    1.6432600607208703
day, information which must have come from Lizzie. It was obviously    1.6065767145351917
the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door.   1.6432600607208703
The New Bedford <Standard-Times> has reported Knowlton    1.3761581156320553
as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew what Borden said    1.7026049541338664
during his conversation with Morse, he would have convicted "somebody".    1.5636360329510388
Notice, Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a    1.6065767145351917
conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have convicted    1.67495327387791
"somebody".   It is known that Morse did associate with    1.5127085093302464
a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at    1.6065767145351917
Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were a vagabond lot    1.67495327387791
and considered to be shady and undesirable characters. Fall River police    1.6065767145351917
did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against    1.67495327387791
Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from    1.6432600607208703
among these men. These officers found no incriminating information.   1.5127085093302464
Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He said he    1.6432600607208703
returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar. The woman    1.67495327387791
in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said    1.7026049541338664
she left when he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a    1.7269387314284994
fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve noon. If this woman    1.6432600607208703
had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping, she would have    1.6432600607208703
had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was    1.6432600607208703
eaten at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse told the woman    1.7026049541338664
it was 11:20, but it could have been earlier, since she did serve    1.67495327387791
dinner on time. Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi.    1.67495327387791
They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he    1.5636360329510388
had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger. Questioned    1.67495327387791
further, Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding    1.6432600607208703
on the same car with him. The conductor did recall having priests    1.6432600607208703
as passengers and this satisfied police, although the conductor also    1.5636360329510388
pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests    1.6065767145351917
riding on almost every trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement    1.6065767145351917
really proved nothing.   We do know that Morse left the house    1.6065767145351917
before nine o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through the    1.6065767145351917
side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door.    1.67495327387791
From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked    1.7269387314284994
leisurely to where his niece was staying, more than a mile away.    1.6432600607208703
He met nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting of his movements    1.7269387314284994
in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs&    1.67495327387791
Borden was killed.   Morse testified that while he was having    1.5636360329510388
breakfast in the dining room, Mrs& Borden told the servant, "Bridget,    1.6065767145351917
I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's testimony    1.5636360329510388
was in direct contradiction. She said it was after she returned    1.6065767145351917
from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs& Borden told    1.6432600607208703
her to wash the windows. This was long after Morse had left the house.   1.7026049541338664
Morse's knowledge of what Mrs& Borden told Bridget could    1.5127085093302464
indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden    1.6432600607208703
there. He knew the house fairly well, he had been there on two previous    1.7026049541338664
visits during the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's    1.6432600607208703
attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than    1.6065767145351917
a drum, this was not true. The screen door was unlocked for some ten    1.7026049541338664
or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back. It was unlocked    1.67495327387791
all the time she was washing windows. Morse could have returned    1.6065767145351917
openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room    1.7269387314284994
he had occupied. Mrs& Borden would not have been alarmed if she    1.6432600607208703
saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm    1.748515906000203
the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet    1.7026049541338664
at the farm. Mrs& Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him    1.67495327387791
and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she    1.67495327387791
could cry out. He could have left for Weybosset Street after her    1.6432600607208703
murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.   If    1.67495327387791
he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return, he could    1.67495327387791
have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr& Borden came    1.6065767145351917
home. With Lizzie in the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget    1.6432600607208703
upstairs in her attic room, he would have had free and easy access to    1.7026049541338664
the house. With the second murder over, he could have left, hidden the    1.67495327387791
weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood.    1.6432600607208703
His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree,    1.67495327387791
with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding    1.6432600607208703
the side door, was odd. There was no close examination of his    1.6432600607208703
clothes for bloodstains, and certainly no scientific test was made of    1.6065767145351917
them. And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing,    1.67495327387791
a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.   1.7026049541338664
The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was    1.5636360329510388
no financial gain for Morse in the murders.   On the other side    1.6432600607208703
of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with    1.748515906000203
whom she was staying. The time would have been shortly after the    1.6432600607208703
murder of Mrs& Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior.    1.6432600607208703
He said he had promised Mrs& Borden to return in time for dinner    1.67495327387791
and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden    1.7269387314284994
What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible    1.5636360329510388
suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:   "The    1.4513752902486308
police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr& Morse as in    1.67495327387791
possession of guilty knowledge. Neither had any interest in the deaths;    1.6065767145351917
indeed, it was probably to Mr& Morse's advantage to have    1.5636360329510388
Mr& and Mrs& Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated    1.6065767145351917
by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion of Bridget    1.5636360329510388
Sullivan as a possible suspect.   Although Pearson disbelieved    1.4513752902486308
almost everything Lizzie said, and read a sinister purpose into almost    1.6065767145351917
everything she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget    1.5636360329510388
as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be said about the    1.67495327387791
servant girl.   The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration,    1.6065767145351917
but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported in the    1.5636360329510388
testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer had asked Lizzie    1.5636360329510388
if she suspected her Uncle Morse, and she replied she didn't    1.6065767145351917
think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned    1.7026049541338664
after them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie    1.6065767145351917
pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her    1.7026049541338664
room    1.0
before her father's murder and came down when she called her.   1.6065767145351917
Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told police about    1.5636360329510388
the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some    1.6065767145351917
weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of    1.7026049541338664
town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner.    1.6432600607208703
And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington, she also did not    1.6065767145351917
accuse him. At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew    1.6432600607208703
anybody her father had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings    1.6432600607208703
toward    1.0
her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has not been    1.67495327387791
friendly with him. They have not been friendly for years". Asked    1.6065767145351917
who this was, she named Harrington. Her statement certainly was true;    1.6065767145351917
the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview,    1.5636360329510388
but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the    1.6432600607208703
killer.   When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up pears    1.6432600607208703
in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in the household besides    1.67495327387791
Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the    1.67495327387791
murders. He said he had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget    1.67495327387791
Sullivan"? I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there",    1.5636360329510388
he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant    1.5636360329510388
she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed    1.6065767145351917
at the time of the murders.   Everyone somehow manages to overlook    1.6065767145351917
completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two    1.67495327387791
people in and about the house at the time of both murders: Lizzie    1.67495327387791
Borden and Bridget Sullivan.   All the officials on the case    1.5636360329510388
seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was    1.7026049541338664
concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of    1.5636360329510388
servants who have murdered their employers. True, it is no longer cricket    1.6432600607208703
for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing    1.7026049541338664
here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters    1.6065767145351917
and situations.   The actions of Bridget should be examined,    1.5127085093302464
since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her    1.67495327387791
innocence. There are also other factors that require closer examination.   1.5636360329510388
The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes    1.6065767145351917
the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the    1.5636360329510388
trial with a "big bundle" of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping    1.67495327387791
her mouth shut. The people who believe and retell the legend have    1.6432600607208703
apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know    1.6432600607208703
that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to    1.6432600607208703
the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget did get any bundles of cash,    1.6432600607208703
the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would    1.6432600607208703
have been Lizzie Borden.   Bridget was born in Ireland, one    1.5636360329510388
of fourteen children. She was apparently the pioneer in her family because    1.6432600607208703
she had no close relatives in this country at that time. She worked    1.67495327387791
as a domestic, first in Newport for a year, and then in South    1.67495327387791
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for another year. She finally settled in Fall    1.5636360329510388
River and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs& Reed, was    1.67495327387791
hired by the Bordens.   I have previously described how, during    1.5636360329510388
the week of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing    1.67495327387791
and ironing clothes.    1.0
Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in    1.6065767145351917
the famous introduction to the <Scarlet Letter> as one of those who    1.6432600607208703
came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor    1.7026049541338664
of the port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr& Upton possessed    1.6432600607208703
intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a devoted Christian.    1.5636360329510388
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical    1.5636360329510388
subjects. Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad    1.6432600607208703
interests.   There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood    1.5127085093302464
had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye, a retentive memory,    1.6432600607208703
and a critical faculty. When she was nine years old, she wrote    1.6432600607208703
a description of a store she had visited. She named 48 items, and said    1.7026049541338664
there were "many more things which it would take too long to write".    1.67495327387791
An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years of age quoted the    1.6432600607208703
Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada,    1.5636360329510388
and the views of George Washington.   Lucy Upton was graduated    1.5636360329510388
from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and    1.6065767145351917
Elmira, were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning    1.6432600607208703
that could not be denied.   A picture of her in high school comes    1.67495327387791
from a younger schoolmate, Albert S& Flint, friend of her brother    1.6065767145351917
Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer. He recalled    1.5636360329510388
Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly    1.5636360329510388
through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little    1.7026049541338664
recitation room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive    1.5636360329510388
mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected    1.67495327387791
to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men.    1.67495327387791
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this. With four younger    1.6432600607208703
children at home, Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after    1.6432600607208703
the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's comfort    1.6065767145351917
and stay until he died in 1879. But even so Lucy could not give up    1.7269387314284994
her intellectual pursuits. When her brother Winslow became a student    1.5636360329510388
at Brown University in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history    1.67495327387791
he was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof& Diman's    1.5636360329510388
definition of civilization, and take the world through, is its progress    1.6065767145351917
ever onward, or does it retrograde at times? Do you think I    1.6432600607208703
might profitably study some of the history you do, perhaps two weeks    1.6432600607208703
behind you **h". And that she proceeded to do.   Many years later    1.6432600607208703
(on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon    1.5636360329510388
to be graduated from Smith College: "While I love botany which,    1.6065767145351917
after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods    1.6065767145351917
of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating    1.7269387314284994
to take up zoology in the way you are doing. Whatever was the    1.67495327387791
science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite    1.7026049541338664
study. Mathematics came next".   Her study of history    1.4513752902486308
was persistently pursued. She read Maitland's <Dark Ages>, "which    1.5127085093302464
I enjoyed very much"; La Croix on the <Customs of the Middle    1.6432600607208703
Ages>; 16 chapters of Bryce "and liked it more and more";    1.6065767145351917
more chapters of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's <Eastern Church>.    1.5127085093302464
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions    1.6065767145351917
that came to her as she studied alone.   Lucy's correspondence    1.5636360329510388
with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken    1.6065767145351917
up with academic studies. She played chess with him by postcard.    1.6065767145351917
Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could    1.67495327387791
make the most words from the letters in "importunately". Who won    1.6065767145351917
is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to    1.6432600607208703
1,212 words.   There was another family interest also. Winslow    1.5127085093302464
had musical talents, as had his father before him. At different times    1.6432600607208703
he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist. And it was    1.67495327387791
Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music    1.67495327387791
at Spelman College.   Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown    1.5127085093302464
University and two years of graduate study, accepted a position    1.5636360329510388
at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was connected with    1.6065767145351917
the U&S& Naval Observatory and with the U&S& Signal Corps;    1.5636360329510388
and after 1883, was professor of astronomy at Brown University.    1.5636360329510388
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was    1.67495327387791
a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as    1.6432600607208703
to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's death, Lucy    1.6432600607208703
and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington,    1.67495327387791
D&C&. "Their house", writes Albert S& Flint,    1.3761581156320553
"was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful    1.6065767145351917
to one like myself far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the    1.7026049541338664
household. Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor. Winslow,    1.6065767145351917
as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize    1.5636360329510388
her as "our iron sister". There is reason to suppose that Lucy    1.6432600607208703
would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother    1.6065767145351917
had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about    1.7026049541338664
to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert S& Flint expressed    1.6432600607208703
his conviction that "her physical strength, her mental power, her    1.5636360329510388
lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve    1.6432600607208703
her fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished career    1.6065767145351917
amongst the noted women of this country".   While in Washington,    1.5636360329510388
D&C&, Lucy Upton held positions in the U&S& Census    1.5127085093302464
Office, and in the Pension Bureau. They were not sufficiently challenging    1.6065767145351917
however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her    1.6432600607208703
brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study. After the    1.67495327387791
months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church    1.6432600607208703
and community life.   What was called an "accidental meeting"    1.5127085093302464
with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman.    1.5636360329510388
Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence with Miss    1.6065767145351917
Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came    1.67495327387791
to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although    1.6432600607208703
there was then no money available to pay her a salary. She served for    1.7026049541338664
a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.   1.6065767145351917
Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship    1.5636360329510388
and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students;    1.6432600607208703
of her "great power of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness    1.5127085093302464
of dress", "her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts    1.6065767145351917
of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants and birds;    1.6432600607208703
and her close knowledge of individual students.   She drew    1.5127085093302464
on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them    1.7026049541338664
at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on    1.67495327387791
her purse as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only    1.7026049541338664
because of her unobtrusive help.   Under Miss Upton, the work    1.5636360329510388
of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption. After all,    1.5636360329510388
she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except    1.7026049541338664
for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She had taught classes    1.6065767145351917
in botany, astronomy (with the aid of a telescope), geometry,    1.5636360329510388
and    1.0
psychology.   Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact,    1.6065767145351917
had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring minds; and    1.6432600607208703
both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the    1.6432600607208703
development of sturdy character and Christian zeal. Both loved the    1.5636360329510388
out-of-doors, including mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890    1.5127085093302464
when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss    1.67495327387791
Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and "with rare    1.6432600607208703
executive ability" bore the brunt of "the entire pilgrimage from    1.5636360329510388
beginning to end". So strenuous it was physically, with its days of    1.6432600607208703
horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance    1.67495327387791
for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived on    1.6065767145351917
it.   At the Fifteenth    1.0
Anniversary (1896) as already quoted, Miss    1.2818970554302986
Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future    1.6065767145351917
as a college of first rank, with expanding and unlimited horizons.    1.6065767145351917
When Dr& Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined    1.6065767145351917
to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley    1.6432600607208703
(April 7, 1923) "**h If you had asked me, I think I would have    1.7026049541338664
suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton. Her services    1.6065767145351917
to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I    1.7026049541338664
have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her".   1.67495327387791
Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary    1.5636360329510388
after the death of Miss Giles.   At the meeting of the    1.6065767145351917
Board of Trustees, on March 3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual    1.6432600607208703
report of the President. She noted that no student had been withdrawn    1.6432600607208703
through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase    1.5636360329510388
of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work    1.6065767145351917
had gone forward smoothly. She urged the importance of more thorough    1.6065767145351917
preparation for admission. The raising of the $25,000 Improvement    1.5127085093302464
Fund two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous "praise    1.6432600607208703
demonstration" held afterward on the campus, were reported as    1.5127085093302464
events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles. With the Fund in    1.6432600607208703
hand, the debt on the boilers had been paid; Rockefeller and Packard    1.6432600607208703
Halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken    1.6065767145351917
for the superintendent's home. Miss Upton spoke gratefully of    1.5127085093302464
the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise    1.6432600607208703
the Fund, and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly    1.6065767145351917
needed current expenses. She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the    1.6065767145351917
many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the    1.5636360329510388
years had made the work so fruitful in results.   Two bequests    1.6065767145351917
were recorded: one of $200 under the will of Mrs& Harriet A&    1.6432600607208703
Copp of Los Angeles; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia    1.7026049541338664
L& Brett of Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.   1.6432600607208703
Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles    1.6065767145351917
was "the sorest grief" the Seminary had ever been called upon    1.6065767145351917
to bear. The daughters of Spelman, she said, had never known or thought    1.67495327387791
of Spelman without her. The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier    1.6432600607208703
had caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles.    1.6065767145351917
Now the school was indeed bereft. "Yet Spelman has strong, deep roots,    1.6432600607208703
Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became ill in    1.5127085093302464
March, 1910; and when school closed, she was unable to travel to Massachusetts.    1.67495327387791
She remained in Atlanta through June and July; she    1.5127085093302464
died on August sixth.   Before coming on a visit to Spelman    1.6065767145351917
in 1885, Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and    1.6432600607208703
her position there was held open for her for a considerable period. But    1.67495327387791
she decided to stay at Spelman. She helped with teaching as well    1.6432600607208703
as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes    1.7026049541338664
in geography, rhetoric and bookkeeping. Soon the office work claimed    1.5636360329510388
all her time. She was closely associated with the Founders in all    1.6432600607208703
their trials and hardships. Quiet and energetic, cheerful and calm,    1.5636360329510388
she too was a power in the development of the seminary. Miss Giles    1.67495327387791
always used to refer to her as "Sister". She served as secretary    1.6432600607208703
in the Seminary office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence,    1.67495327387791
records, and bookkeeping. The books of the school hold a memorial    1.6065767145351917
to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.   1.6432600607208703
Mary J& Packard, states a <Messenger> editorial, was "efficient,    1.5127085093302464
pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating the spirit of her    1.4513752902486308
Master. With infinite patience she responded to every call, no matter    1.6065767145351917
at what cost to herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to    1.7269387314284994
have the needed information or word of cheer.   1.4513752902486308
In a few school districts one finds a link between school and    1.6432600607208703
job. In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money,    1.5127085093302464
there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer    1.7026049541338664
on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other. In these cases    1.7026049541338664
a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program, saving    1.5636360329510388
a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12. The apprentice    1.7026049541338664
program will involve further education on a part-time basis, usually    1.5636360329510388
at night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high    1.6432600607208703
school. These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such    1.6432600607208703
crafts as auto mechanics, carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die    1.5127085093302464
work, and sheet-metal work.   Formally organized vocational    1.3761581156320553
programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to    1.5636360329510388
gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time    1.7269387314284994
job on graduation. The "diversified occupations" program is a    1.5127085093302464
part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on    1.5127085093302464
a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business    1.6065767145351917
employers. The "distributive education" program operates in    1.3761581156320553
a similar way, with arrangements between the school and employers in    1.6065767145351917
merchandising    1.0
fields. In both cases the student attends school half-time    1.5127085093302464
and works in a regular job the other half. He receives remuneration    1.6432600607208703
for his work. In a few places cooperative programs between schools    1.6065767145351917
and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing    1.6432600607208703
the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are    1.6065767145351917
immediately marketable upon graduation.   Adult education courses,    1.3761581156320553
work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of    1.5636360329510388
a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities    1.5636360329510388
for out-of-school youth. In general, however, it may be said    1.5636360329510388
that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school, the school authorities    1.7026049541338664
play little or no part in the decision of what happens next. If the    1.7026049541338664
student drops out of high school, the break with the school is even    1.67495327387791
more complete. When there is employment opportunity for youth, this    1.5636360329510388
arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well. Indeed,    1.5636360329510388
in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities    1.67495327387791
have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were    1.6432600607208703
potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and    1.6432600607208703
went to work. Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation,    1.6432600607208703
although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in    1.6432600607208703
retrospect may have been a wise one. I make no attempt to measure the    1.7026049541338664
enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work    1.6432600607208703
on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business    1.6432600607208703
which he entered. He may or may not be "better off" than his    1.67495327387791
classmate who went on to a college and professional school. But in    1.6432600607208703
the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all    1.6432600607208703
the potential professional talent.   In a later chapter dealing    1.5127085093302464
with the suburban school, I shall discuss the importance of arranging    1.6065767145351917
a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any    1.6432600607208703
high school where he is found. In the Negro neighborhoods and also    1.6432600607208703
to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of    1.67495327387791
identification and motivation. High motivation towards higher education    1.4513752902486308
must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches    1.7026049541338664
grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are    1.7026049541338664
essential for academic work. Undoubtedly far more can be done in the    1.6432600607208703
lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools. However, the teacher    1.6432600607208703
can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family    1.7026049541338664
is anti-intellectual. And the fact remains that there are today few    1.6065767145351917
shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.    1.5127085093302464
This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern    1.7269387314284994
universities. Quite the contrary, as I can testify from personal    1.5636360329510388
experience as a former university president. Rather we see here    1.5636360329510388
another vicious circle. The absence of successful Negroes in the world    1.6065767145351917
of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among    1.6065767145351917
Negro youth for academic careers. I believe the situation is improving,    1.6065767145351917
but the success stories need to be heavily publicized. Here again    1.6065767145351917
we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated    1.67495327387791
as Negroes in the press. How can the vicious circle be broken? This    1.67495327387791
is a problem to which leaders of opinion, both Negro and white,    1.6432600607208703
should devote far more attention. It is at least as important as the    1.67495327387791
more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South.    1.6432600607208703
I should like to underline four points    1.3761581156320553
I made in my first report with respect to vocational education. First    1.6432600607208703
and foremost, vocational courses should not replace courses which    1.5127085093302464
are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation. Second,    1.6065767145351917
vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and    1.6065767145351917
not require more than half the student's time in those years; however,    1.6432600607208703
for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to    1.5636360329510388
begin earlier. Third, the significance of the vocational courses is    1.5636360329510388
that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize    1.6065767145351917
the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers, and this    1.67495327387791
sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they    1.6432600607208703
are studying at the same time. Fourth, the type of vocational training    1.6432600607208703
programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the    1.5636360329510388
general locality. This last point is important because if high school    1.6065767145351917
pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain    1.67495327387791
vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training,    1.6432600607208703
the whole idea of relevance disappears. Vocational training which    1.5127085093302464
holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable    1.67495327387791
skill becomes just another school "chore" for those whose interest    1.5636360329510388
in their studies has begun to falter. Those who, because of population    1.6432600607208703
mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees,    1.6432600607208703
would limit vocational education to general rather than specific    1.5127085093302464
skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind    1.67495327387791
of school experience.   I have been using the word "vocational"    1.5636360329510388
as a layman would at first sight think it should be used. I intend    1.7026049541338664
to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys    1.6432600607208703
and girls. These courses develop skills other than those we think of    1.6432600607208703
when we use the adjective "academic". Practically all of these practical    1.6065767145351917
skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained    1.7026049541338664
in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at    1.67495327387791
once on the basis of the skill. They are in this sense skills marketable    1.7026049541338664
immediately on graduation from high school. To be sure, in tool-and-die    1.6065767145351917
work and in the building trades, the first job must be often    1.6432600607208703
on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time vocational training    1.6065767145351917
enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status.    1.6432600607208703
Similarly, a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography    1.6432600607208703
and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job    1.7026049541338664
at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two    1.7269387314284994
of further study in a community college or secretarial school. Of course,    1.6432600607208703
it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and    1.6432600607208703
with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill. So, too, is the    1.67495327387791
mathematical    1.0
competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics.    1.5636360329510388
In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be    1.6432600607208703
considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student    1.6432600607208703
in his vocation (which may be a profession) will be called upon to use    1.7026049541338664
some of the skills developed and the competence obtained. In spite    1.6065767145351917
of the shading of one type of course into another, I believe it is useful    1.7269387314284994
to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses.    1.5636360329510388
Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which    1.6432600607208703
proves the rule. Today many college bound students try to take a    1.6432600607208703
course in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of mastery of    1.67495327387791
this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work    1.67495327387791
in college and a professional school.   Most of our largest    1.5636360329510388
cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools.    1.6065767145351917
In this respect, public education in the large cities differs from education    1.6432600607208703
in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts. The    1.5127085093302464
neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking, comprehensive schools,    1.5127085093302464
because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational    1.6432600607208703
or technical high school instead of the local school. Indeed, one    1.6065767145351917
school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term    1.67495327387791
comprehensive    1.0
high school for the senior high schools in his city, because    1.6065767145351917
these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs. He prefers    1.5636360329510388
to designate such schools as "general" high schools. The suburban    1.5636360329510388
high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely comprehensive    1.6432600607208703
high school because of the absence of vocational programs. The reason    1.6065767145351917
is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community. Therefore    1.7269387314284994
employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan    1.5636360329510388
area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic    1.6065767145351917
of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.   1.5636360329510388
The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities    1.6065767145351917
must be reckoned as permanent institutions. By and large their programs    1.6065767145351917
are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and    1.5127085093302464
to the realities of the apprentice system. It is not often realized    1.6432600607208703
to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of    1.6432600607208703
employment, except for a lucky few. One has to talk confidentially with    1.6432600607208703
some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a    1.6432600607208703
boy cannot just say, "I want to be a plumber", and then, by doing    1.7026049541338664
good work, find a job. It is far more difficult in many communities    1.67495327387791
to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval    1.6065767145351917
than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation.    1.6432600607208703
Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind. One vocational instructor    1.6432600607208703
in a city vocational school, speaking of his course in a certain    1.6432600607208703
field, said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs <outside>    1.6432600607208703
of the city. In the city, he said, the waiting list for those    1.67495327387791
who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside    1.748515906000203
track he can't get in. In a far distant part of the United States,    1.7026049541338664
I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade    1.7026049541338664
was doing special work. "What does he have in mind to do when he    1.7026049541338664
graduates"? "Oh, he'll be a plumber", came the answer. "But    1.5636360329510388
isn't it almost impossible to get into the union"? I asked.    1.6065767145351917
"He'll have no difficulty", I was told. "He has very good    1.6065767145351917
connections".   In my view, there should be a school which offers    1.6065767145351917
significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every    1.5636360329510388
family in a city. Ideally these schools should be so located that    1.6432600607208703
one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is    1.7026049541338664
at the highest.   An excellent example of a successful location    1.5636360329510388
of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School    1.6432600607208703
in Chicago. Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment,    1.6065767145351917
this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational    1.6065767145351917
aims of its students. Hardly a window has been broken since    1.6065767145351917
Dunbar    1.0
first was opened (and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many    1.67495327387791
slum areas). I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost    1.67495327387791
all the pupils were Negroes. They were learning trades as diverse    1.6065767145351917
as shoe repairing, bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics,    1.5127085093302464
and airplane mechanics. The physical facilities at Dunbar are    1.5127085093302464
impressive, but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils.   1.5636360329510388
The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the    1.6065767145351917
world. In the United States, where half of the world crop is grown,    1.67495327387791
soybeans are processed for their edible oil. The residue from soybean    1.6065767145351917
processing goes mainly into animal feeds.   Soybeans are extensively    1.5127085093302464
processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient.    1.6065767145351917
American chemists, seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have    1.5127085093302464
adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their    1.5127085093302464
use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh    1.67495327387791
of Indonesia. Soybean flour, grits, flakes, "milk", and curd can    1.5636360329510388
be bought in the United States.   Peanuts are the world's    1.5636360329510388
second most important legume. They are used mainly for their oil. We    1.6432600607208703
produce peanut oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed.    1.7026049541338664
Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating    1.6065767145351917
as nuts, are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off.   1.6065767145351917
Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans,    1.6065767145351917
comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of    1.6065767145351917
Asia and Africa.   In western Europe and North America, where    1.5636360329510388
the level of economic development is higher, grains and other seed    1.6065767145351917
products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed. Rather,    1.5636360329510388
meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy products are the main sources of    1.6432600607208703
carbohydrate,    1.0
protein, oils, and fats. People depend less on seeds for    1.5636360329510388
foods in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive grazing    1.5636360329510388
lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption of meat is high.   1.6432600607208703
Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's    1.5127085093302464
cereal crop in 1957-1958. Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy    1.7026049541338664
cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry. About 90 percent    1.6432600607208703
of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals. The rest    1.7026049541338664
is used for human food and industrial products. More than half of the    1.67495327387791
sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the    1.67495327387791
milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.   1.6432600607208703
More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed    1.6432600607208703
to livestock annually in the United States.   The efficiency    1.5127085093302464
with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily    1.6432600607208703
in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased    1.6432600607208703
feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds    1.6432600607208703
THE DEMAND for food is so great in    1.4513752902486308
the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood    1.7026049541338664
crops. Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor    1.5636360329510388
position.   Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial    1.5636360329510388
uses are the oil-bearing seeds- flax, castor, tung (nuts from    1.5636360329510388
the China wood-oil tree), perilla (from an Oriental mint), and oiticica    1.6065767145351917
(from a Brazilian tree).   Oils, or liquid fats, from the    1.5636360329510388
seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints    1.67495327387791
and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood    1.5636360329510388
and metal. These oils develop hard, smooth films when they dry and form    1.67495327387791
resinlike substances.   The artist who paints in oil uses drying    1.5636360329510388
oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the    1.67495327387791
ages. One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds.   1.6432600607208703
Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape yield semidrying    1.5636360329510388
oils. Some are used in paints along with drying oils. Palm oil    1.6432600607208703
protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin.   1.6432600607208703
Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out of style as a    1.6432600607208703
medicine. This nondrying oil, however, is now more in demand than ever    1.6432600607208703
before as a fine lubricant, as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically    1.6432600607208703
operated equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.   1.6065767145351917
Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used extensively    1.5127085093302464
in perfumery to extract flower fragrances. It is still used in drugs    1.6432600607208703
and cosmetics, but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with    1.6432600607208703
oils from peach and plum seeds.   Liquid fats from all these    1.6065767145351917
oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household    1.6432600607208703
and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives.   1.5636360329510388
Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel oil- seed    1.5636360329510388
oils that are produced primarily for food purposes- also are used    1.6065767145351917
to make soaps, detergents, and paint resins.   Solid fats from    1.5636360329510388
the seeds of the mahua tree, the shea tree, and the coconut palm are used    1.7269387314284994
to make candles in tropical countries.   Seeds are a main source    1.6065767145351917
of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world.    1.67495327387791
Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada,    1.67495327387791
and Australia. In other countries where cereal grains are not    1.5636360329510388
among the principal crops of a region, starchy tubers or roots are processed    1.67495327387791
for starch. Starch is used in the paper, textile, and food-processing    1.6065767145351917
industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.   1.5127085093302464
Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium (fleawort), flax,    1.4513752902486308
and locust (carob) seeds in ancient times. Today the yearly import    1.6065767145351917
into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds;    1.7026049541338664
of psyllium seed, more than 2.6 million. The discovery during    1.5636360329510388
the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust    1.6432600607208703
gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the    1.6432600607208703
United States.   Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs    1.5636360329510388
and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners, stabilizers,    1.6065767145351917
or dispersing agents. Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes    1.5636360329510388
ice cream. Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting    1.6065767145351917
lotions. Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium was sold    1.5636360329510388
in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands.    1.6065767145351917
Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers    1.7026049541338664
THE SEEDS of hard, fibrous, stony fruits,    1.3761581156320553
called nuts, provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other materials    1.5636360329510388
of value. Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel    1.6065767145351917
and its thick, adherent, brown covering- the seedcoat.   The    1.5127085093302464
kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts, hazelnuts, hickory    1.5127085093302464
nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts are predominantly oily. Almonds    1.5636360329510388
and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein.    1.7026049541338664
Chestnuts are starchy. All nut kernels are rich in protein.    1.5636360329510388
The world production of familiar seed nuts- almonds, brazil nuts,    1.5636360329510388
filberts, and the English walnuts- totals about 300 thousand tons annually.   1.6065767145351917
Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the largest    1.5636360329510388
of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a    1.67495327387791
crop for domestic and export markets. The oil palm of West Africa yields    1.67495327387791
edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit.    1.7026049541338664
World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut,    1.5636360329510388
was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959. Exports from producing    1.67495327387791
countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million    1.67495327387791
tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about    1.7026049541338664
half was palm oil.   Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include    1.6065767145351917
the spicy nutmeg; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing power    1.6065767145351917
to natural saponins; the marking nut, used for ink and varnish; the    1.6432600607208703
aromatic sassafras nut of South America; and the sweet-smelling    1.5127085093302464
cumara nut, which is suited for perfumes.   A forest crop that has    1.6432600607208703
not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm.    1.6065767145351917
The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized    1.6065767145351917
seed. It is used for making buttons and other small, hard objects of    1.67495327387791
turnery. Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and    1.7026049541338664
THE COLOR AND SHAPE of    1.1606783668269585
seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations.   1.5636360329510388
Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from jobs-tears-    1.5127085093302464
the seeds of an Asiatic grass. Bead tree seeds are the necklaces    1.6432600607208703
of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba.    1.6432600607208703
Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.   1.67495327387791
Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety    1.5127085093302464
of seeds collected during the year.   Tradition has assigned    1.5127085093302464
medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils,    1.5636360329510388
and highly flavored components. Although science has given us more effective    1.6065767145351917
materials, preparations from anise, castorbean, colchicum, nux    1.3761581156320553
vomica, mustard, fennel, and stramonium are familiar to many for the    1.6065767145351917
relief of human ailments. Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still    1.5636360329510388
are used by some persons.   Peanut and sesame oils often are    1.6065767145351917
used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection.   1.5636360329510388
Still another    1.0
group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing    1.3761581156320553
fruits) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the    1.5636360329510388
nutrients they supply are quite negligible. The common spices, flavorings,    1.5636360329510388
and condiments make up this group.   Each year millions of    1.5636360329510388
pounds of anise, caraway, mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils    1.6065767145351917
extracted from them are imported.   Single-seeded dry fruits used    1.5127085093302464
for flavoring include several of the carrot family, such as cumin,    1.6065767145351917
dill, fennel, and angelica. Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages    1.6432600607208703
include fenugreek (artificial maple flavor) and cardamom. White    1.4513752902486308
pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit.   Sesame    1.6432600607208703
seed, which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt,    1.67495327387791
Brazil, and Central America, has a toasted-nut flavor and can be    1.6065767145351917
used in almost any dish calling for almonds. It is a main flavoring for    1.7026049541338664
halvah, the candy of the Middle East. Sesame sticks, a snack dip,    1.6432600607208703
originated in the Southwest.   Beverages are made from seeds    1.5127085093302464
the world over.   Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds    1.6432600607208703
of the coffee tree. World production of coffee broke all previous    1.6065767145351917
records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons. Per capita consumption    1.7026049541338664
remains around 16 pounds in the United States.   Cocoa,    1.5127085093302464
chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao    1.6432600607208703
tree. World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between    1.6432600607208703
Africa (63 percent) and South America (27 percent).   Several    1.5127085093302464
soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts, the seed of the kola    1.6432600607208703
tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America.   Cereal    1.5636360329510388
grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages.    1.5636360329510388
The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain. Arrack is    1.6065767145351917
distilled from fermented rice in India.   Beer, generally fermented    1.5127085093302464
from barley, is an old alcoholic beverage. Beer was brewed by the    1.6432600607208703
Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago. Brewers    1.5636360329510388
today use corn, rice, and malted barley.   Distillers use corn,    1.5636360329510388
SEED CROPS hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy    1.5636360329510388
of the United States.   The farm value of seeds produced in this    1.6432600607208703
country for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly 10 billion    1.6065767145351917
dollars a year. Cereal grains, oilseeds, and dry beans and peas account    1.6432600607208703
for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised.   1.6432600607208703
The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater, because    1.6065767145351917
additional returns are obtained from most of the corn, oats, barley,    1.6065767145351917
and sorghum- as well as the cake and meal from the processing    1.6432600607208703
of flaxseed, cottonseed, and soybeans- through conversion to poultry,    1.5127085093302464
meat, and dairy products.   Seeds furnish about 40 percent of    1.5636360329510388
the total nutrients consumed by all livestock. Hay and pasture are the    1.6432600607208703
other chief sources of livestock feed.   Seeds are the essential    1.5636360329510388
raw materials for milling grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining    1.5127085093302464
edible oil, brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.   More than 11    1.5636360329510388
thousand business establishments in the United States were based on    1.5636360329510388
cereals and oilseeds in 1954. The value of products from these industries    1.6432600607208703
was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third was created    1.5636360329510388
by manufacturing processes. Not included was the value of seed oil in    1.6432600607208703
paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries    1.6432600607208703
that are based on imported seed or seed products.   Cereal grains    1.6065767145351917
furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American    1.6065767145351917
diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock    1.6432600607208703
and poultry.   1.0
To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home    1.7269387314284994
was called "locatin'" 'em. To keep 'em scattered somewhat    1.5127085093302464
and yet herd 'em was called "loose herdin'". To hold 'em in    1.6432600607208703
a compact mass was "close herdin'". Cattle were inclined to remain    1.6065767145351917
in a territory with which they were acquainted. That became their    1.6065767145351917
"home range". Yet there were always some that moved farther and    1.6065767145351917
farther out, seekin' grass and water. These became "strays",    1.5127085093302464
the term bein' restricted to cattle, however, as hosses, under like    1.6065767145351917
circumstances, were spoken of as "stray hosses", not merely "strays".   1.5636360329510388
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it    1.6065767145351917
was over. You couldn't stop 'em; you had to go with 'em or wait    1.7026049541338664
till the storm was over, and follow. Such marchin' in wholesale    1.6065767145351917
numbers was called a "drift", or "winter drift", and if the storm    1.6432600607208703
was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the    1.6432600607208703
range. The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number    1.6432600607208703
of them animals. The single animal or a small bunch were referred    1.6432600607208703
to as "strays"; but when a large number were "bunched up"    1.6065767145351917
or "banded up", and marched away from their home range, as long as    1.67495327387791
they stayed together the group was said to be a "drift". Drifts    1.6432600607208703
usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds,    1.67495327387791
but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or    1.7269387314284994
grass because of a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede. Drifts    1.67495327387791
usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid    1.6432600607208703
'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.   The wholesale    1.5127085093302464
death of cattle as a result of blizzards, and sometimes droughts, over    1.6432600607208703
a wide range of territory was called a "die-up". Followin' such    1.6065767145351917
an event there was usually a harvest of "fallen hides", and the    1.6432600607208703
ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons. Cattle    1.5127085093302464
were said to be "potted" when "blizzard choked", that is, caught    1.6065767145351917
in a corner or a draw, or against a "drift fence" durin' a    1.67495327387791
storm. Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as    1.6432600607208703
the "winter kill". When cattle in winter stopped and humped their    1.6065767145351917
backs up they were said to "bow up". This term was also used by    1.7026049541338664
the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight, as one cowhand was    1.7026049541338664
heard to say, "He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm". Cattle    1.7026049541338664
drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature    1.6432600607208703
'em into prime beef were said to be "double wintered".   Cattle    1.6065767145351917
brought into a range from a distance were called "immigrants".    1.5636360329510388
Them new to the country were referred to as "pilgrims". This    1.6065767145351917
word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle, but later    1.6065767145351917
was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot. Hereford cattle    1.6432600607208703
were often called "white faces", or "open-face cattle",    1.4513752902486308
and the old-time cowman gave the name of "hothouse stock" to them    1.6432600607208703
newly introduced cattle. Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed,    1.5636360329510388
they were rarely seen on a ranch, though one might be found now and    1.7026049541338664
then for the milk supply. The cowboy called this breed of cattle "magpies".    1.67495327387791
A "cattaloe" was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and    1.5127085093302464
cattle.    1.0
"Dry stock" denoted, regardless of age or sex, such bovines    1.5636360329510388
as were givin' no milk. A "wet herd" was a herd of cattle made    1.7026049541338664
up entirely of cows, while "wet stuff" referred to cows givin'    1.6065767145351917
milk. The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a "milk    1.67495327387791
pitcher". Cows givin' no milk were knowed as "strippers".    1.5127085093302464
The terminology of the range, in speakin' of "dry stock" and    1.6065767145351917
"wet stock", was confusin' to the tenderfoot. The most common reference    1.6065767145351917
to "wet stock" was with the meanin' that such animals had    1.6065767145351917
been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their    1.6065767145351917
rightful owners. The term soon became used and applied to all stolen    1.6432600607208703
animals. "Mixed herd" meant a herd of mixed sexes, while a "straight    1.6432600607208703
steer herd" was one composed entirely of steers, and when the    1.6065767145351917
cowman spoke of "mixed cattle", he meant cattle of various grades,    1.6065767145351917
ages, and sexes.   In the spring when penned cattle were turned    1.6065767145351917
out to grass, this was spoken of as "turn-out time", or "put    1.6432600607208703
to grass". "Shootin' 'em out" was gettin' cattle out of    1.5636360329510388
a corral onto the range. When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin'    1.748515906000203
run she was said to "come out a-stoopin'". To stir cattle    1.6065767145351917
up and get 'em heated and excited was to "mustard the cattle", and    1.67495327387791
the act was called "ginnin' 'em 'round", or "chousin'    1.5127085093302464
'em". After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands    1.6432600607208703
toward their home range was called "throwin' over".    1.4513752902486308
A cow rose from the ground rear end first. By the time her hindquarters    1.7026049541338664
were in a standin' position, her knees were on the ground in a prayin'    1.7026049541338664
attitude. It was when she was in this position that the name    1.6432600607208703
"prayin' cow" was suggested to the cowboy. They were said to be    1.6432600607208703
"on their heads" when grazin'. "On the hoof" was a reference    1.6065767145351917
to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin'    1.6432600607208703
by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail. Shippin'    1.6432600607208703
cattle by train was called a "stock run". A general classification    1.6065767145351917
given grass-fed cattle was "grassers".   When a cowboy    1.4513752902486308
spoke of "dustin'" a cow, he meant that he throwed dust into her    1.67495327387791
eyes. The cow, unlike a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her    1.7026049541338664
mind on her business when chargin', and a cow "on the prod" or "on    1.7026049541338664
the peck" was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other    1.67495327387791
charges.   The Injun's name for beef was "wohaw", and many    1.5636360329510388
of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun    1.6432600607208703
on the trails. The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white    1.6432600607208703
man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters. Listenin'    1.6065767145351917
with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted    1.6432600607208703
"Whoa", "Haw", and "Gee", they thought them words the    1.5127085093302464
names of the animals, and began callin' cattle "wohaws". Rarely    1.5636360329510388
did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north    1.67495327387791
that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for "wohaw".   "Tailin'"    1.5636360329510388
was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a    1.67495327387791
rope. Any animal could when travelin' fast, be sent heels over head    1.6432600607208703
by the simple process of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail,    1.6065767145351917
and givin' the latter a pull to one side. This throwed the animal    1.67495327387791
off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders. Though    1.6432600607208703
the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results, many    1.5636360329510388
men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle    1.6432600607208703
horn, supplemented sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave    1.6432600607208703
of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail. Such tactics were    1.6065767145351917
resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns, and a thorough    1.5636360329510388
"tailin'" usually knocked the breath out of a steer, and so dazed    1.6432600607208703
'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day. It required both    1.67495327387791
a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider. When cattle became more    1.67495327387791
valuable, ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued,    1.6065767145351917
at least when the boss was 'round. When the cowboy used the word    1.67495327387791
"tailin's", he meant stragglers.   "Bull tailin'"    1.2818970554302986
was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas. From    1.6432600607208703
a pen of wild bulls one would be released, and with much yellin' a    1.7026049541338664
cowhand'd take after 'im. Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed    1.6432600607208703
his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin' the bull off    1.67495327387791
balance, and "bustin'" 'im with terrific force. Rammin' one    1.5127085093302464
horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called    1.7026049541338664
"peggin'".   Colors of cattle came in for their special names.    1.5636360329510388
An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was    1.6065767145351917
called a "brindle" or "brockle". A "lineback" was an animal    1.5636360329510388
with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin'    1.67495327387791
down its back, while a "lobo stripe" was the white, yeller, or    1.6432600607208703
brown stripe runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic    1.6432600607208703
of many Spanish cattle. A "mealynose" was a cow or steer of    1.6432600607208703
the longhorn type, with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest    1.67495327387791
of its body 'round the eyes, face, and nose. Such an animal was    1.67495327387791
said to be "mealynosed". "Sabinas" was a Spanish word used to    1.6065767145351917
describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'.    1.5636360329510388
The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up    1.6432600607208703
the trail "Sonora reds", while they called all cattle drove up from    1.6432600607208703
Mexico "yaks", because they came from the Yaqui Injun country,    1.5636360329510388
or gave 'em the name of "Mexican buckskins". Near the southern    1.6065767145351917
border, cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black    1.6065767145351917
with a lineback, with white speckles frequently appearin' on the    1.5636360329510388
sides and belly, were called "zorrillas". This word was from the    1.6065767145351917
Spanish, meanin' "polecat". "Yeller bellies" were cattle    1.3761581156320553
of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color. An    1.6432600607208703
animal with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished    1.5127085093302464
and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes used as a    1.67495327387791
"marker". Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the    1.6065767145351917
rustler.   Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was    1.5636360329510388
found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with    1.7026049541338664
the uncounted cattle was called a "range count". The countin'    1.5636360329510388
of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose    1.6432600607208703
was called a "pasture count". The counters rode through the    1.5636360329510388
pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted it back    1.6065767145351917
so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead. This    1.6432600607208703
method of countin' was usually done at the request, and in the presence,    1.67495327387791
of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the    1.6432600607208703
herd. Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as "cattle paper".   1.6065767145351917
A "book count" was the sellin' of cattle by the books,    1.6065767145351917
commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes much to the profit of    1.67495327387791
the seller. This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the    1.67495327387791
"books won't freeze". This became a common byword durin' the    1.5636360329510388
boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle    1.67495327387791
interests. The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper    1.6065767145351917
by the name of Luke Murrin. His saloon was a meetin' place for    1.67495327387791
influential Wyoming cattlemen, and one year durin' a severe blizzard,    1.5636360329510388
when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces, he said,    1.5636360329510388
"Cheer up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze". In    1.5636360329510388
this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin'    1.6065767145351917
custom of buyin' by book count, and created a sayin' which has survived    1.67495327387791
through the years. "Range delivery" meant that the buyer, after    1.5636360329510388
examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation    1.5127085093302464
for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed to own,    1.5636360329510388
then rode out and tried to find it.   When a cowhand said that a    1.7026049541338664
man had "good cow sense", he meant to pay 'im a high compliment.    1.67495327387791
No matter by what name cattle were called, there was no denyin' that    1.67495327387791
they not only saved Texas from financial ruin, but went far toward    1.6432600607208703
THE first use of the word    1.2818970554302986
"rustler" was as a synonym for "hustler", becomin' an established    1.5636360329510388
term for any person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in    1.6065767145351917
any enterprise. Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler,    1.67495327387791
and when the order was given to go out and "rustle the hosses",    1.67495327387791
it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in. Eventually herdin'    1.67495327387791
the hosses was spoken of as "hoss rustlin'", and the wrangler was    1.6432600607208703
called the "hoss rustler". Later, the word became almost exclusively    1.5636360329510388
applied to a cow thief, startin' from the days of the maverick    1.6432600607208703
when cowhands were paid by their employers to "get out and rustle    1.6432600607208703
a few mavericks".    1.0
IT WAS JOHN who found the lion tracks. He found them near the carcass    1.7026049541338664
of a zebra that had been killed the night before, and he circled    1.67495327387791
once, nose to the ground, hair shooting up along his back, as it did    1.7026049541338664
when he was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head and bayed,    1.7269387314284994
and the pack joined in, all heads high, and Jones knew it was a hot    1.7269387314284994
trail.   He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him    1.6065767145351917
straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain. This mountain was    1.5636360329510388
known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about    1.6432600607208703
two hundred feet, honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub    1.6065767145351917
and creepers and tall grass. On the south it ended sharply as though    1.67495327387791
the lava had been cut off there suddenly.   Kearton and Ulyate    1.6065767145351917
had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs, and Means    1.6432600607208703
and Loveless had taken another route, and now, with the discovery    1.6065767145351917
of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined in, in the    1.67495327387791
shadow of the Reef and pointed. Kearton focussed his field glasses.   1.6065767145351917
"That's the Colonel", he said, "But I can't see the    1.5636360329510388
dogs".   As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef.    1.5636360329510388
Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front    1.67495327387791
of him. The dogs were working a trail- lion? hyena? The pack    1.6432600607208703
had made a bend to the north, swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton    1.7026049541338664
and Ulyate could hear them faintly.   Kearton got off and    1.5636360329510388
tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled    1.7026049541338664
it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless    1.7269387314284994
and Means and the rest of the party.   "Not yet", cautioned    1.6065767145351917
Ulyate.   Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern    1.5636360329510388
toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly, Old John    1.67495327387791
with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others. There    1.5636360329510388
was Sounder, too, also a veteran of the North Rim, and Rastus and    1.67495327387791
the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London    1.7026049541338664
pound, and Simba, a terrier **h. A motley pack, chosen for effectiveness,    1.6432600607208703
not beauty. Jones was galloping close behind them leaning    1.5127085093302464
down, cheering them on.   "Light it"! Ulyate said, and Kearton    1.5636360329510388
touched a match to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked    1.7026049541338664
out. He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column of smoke rose.   1.7269387314284994
"That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we    1.6065767145351917
are".   Two quick shots sounded. Then there was a chorus of    1.6065767145351917
wild barking and baying. Then the heavy roar of a lion.   Kearton    1.6432600607208703
and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound.    1.67495327387791
It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away. At the    1.7269387314284994
base of the rocky hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot.    1.67495327387791
The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers and bushes, so    1.6065767145351917
thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called,    1.6065767145351917
Ulyate answered from ten feet away. Nice country to meet a lion in    1.67495327387791
face to face. Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the    1.67495327387791
barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion, till they    1.67495327387791
came, out of breath, to the crest, and peering through the branches of    1.67495327387791
a bush, this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently (and actually    1.67495327387791
had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside, sitting calmly on    1.5636360329510388
his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness, who was crouched    1.67495327387791
on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the    1.67495327387791
dogs whirled around her.   Ulyate drew back with a start, and put    1.6432600607208703
finger to lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her    1.67495327387791
off, "The dogs have got her bayed **h. She's just the other side    1.67495327387791
of that bush"! And when they had drawn back a step he added:    1.67495327387791
"Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her. Why she doesn't    1.7026049541338664
charge him, I don't know. And he hasn't even got a knife on    1.67495327387791
him. He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground **h. Careful,    1.7026049541338664
Jones had been about a hundred    1.2818970554302986
and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the    1.7269387314284994
Reef. She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when    1.7026049541338664
she saw him she rose to full height and roared, opening her mouth wide,    1.7026049541338664
lashing her tail, and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in    1.6432600607208703
irritation, as much as to say: "How dare you disturb me in my sacred    1.7026049541338664
precinct"?   Intuition told him, however, that she was tired    1.5127085093302464
and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge, yet. He    1.7026049541338664
moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her, being careful, because    1.6065767145351917
he knew the female is less predictable than the male. (In the graveyard    1.67495327387791
at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game    1.6432600607208703
hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso.    1.5636360329510388
Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed by lions, and eleven out    1.6432600607208703
of the seventeen by lionesses.) She snarled terribly but intuition    1.5636360329510388
told    1.0
him, again, that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her    1.67495327387791
attention was distracted by the dogs. He threw the lasso. It was falling    1.67495327387791
over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front    1.748515906000203
of her on the rock. Even then, if she took one step forward he could    1.7269387314284994
catch her. But John nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end    1.6432600607208703
was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona no matter- and she    1.67495327387791
changed ends and took a swipe at John, but he ducked back.   Jones    1.67495327387791
then recoiled his rope and threw again, this time hitting her on    1.6432600607208703
the back but failing to encircle her. She whirled and faced him, roaring    1.67495327387791
terribly, and Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand    1.5636360329510388
why she did not charge and obliterate him, because he wouldn't    1.6065767145351917
have much of a chance of getting away, in that thick growth, but she    1.7026049541338664
seemed just a trace uncertain; while Jones, on the other hand, appeared    1.6432600607208703
perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.   1.5636360329510388
From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature    1.5127085093302464
on the back of another creature, lashing out with its long thin paw,    1.67495327387791
very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with. But    1.67495327387791
now she sank lower to the rock. Her roar changed to a growl. Her    1.7026049541338664
tail    1.0
no longer lashed. Although she appeared more subdued and defeated,    1.5636360329510388
Jones knew she was growing more dangerous. She was rested and could    1.6432600607208703
mount a charge. Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched,    1.7026049541338664
and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.    1.6432600607208703
At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing through the undergrowth    1.6065767145351917
with their horses, and distracted her, and she ran off a short    1.6432600607208703
distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks. The dogs followed    1.6432600607208703
her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.   "We've    1.6065767145351917
got to get her out of there"! Jones yelled, "or she'll    1.6065767145351917
kill 'em all. Bring me the firecrackers".   For such an    1.5636360329510388
emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of    1.5636360329510388
their equipment. Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice, and the    1.6432600607208703
lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.   "Ain't she    1.5636360329510388
a beauty, though"? called out Means as she ran.   "Don't    1.5636360329510388
you go a step nearer her than I do", Jones warned, "and if    1.67495327387791
you do, go at a run so you'll have momentum"!   For two hours    1.67495327387791
they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of    1.67495327387791
the Reef, trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get    1.67495327387791
a good throw. But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore    1.7269387314284994
away. It was hot. The dogs were tired. The men were tired too. It    1.7026049541338664
was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again. And the sun was    1.7026049541338664
beginning to go down. If dark came they would lose her.   "I'll    1.6432600607208703
get a pole", Jones said finally, "and I'll poke a noose    1.6065767145351917
over her    1.0
head"!   At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like    1.5636360329510388
aperture halfway down the Reef. Ulyate made no comment but his face    1.6432600607208703
showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles,    1.6432600607208703
and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago, not the gentler    1.7026049541338664
ones of today, and this one was angry, with good reason. Loveless,    1.6432600607208703
too, objected. "It won't work, Colonel".   "Just the    1.4513752902486308
same we'll try it".   But without waiting for them to try it,    1.6432600607208703
she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain.   1.7026049541338664
John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out    1.6432600607208703
behind, many of them trailing blood. John himself was bruised and    1.6065767145351917
clawed from head to tail, but he was in this fight to the finish, running    1.7269387314284994
almost as strongly now as in the morning.   She took refuge    1.6065767145351917
on a tongue of land extending into a gully, crouched at the base of a    1.7269387314284994
thorn tree, and waited for them to come up. She had chosen the spot well.    1.7269387314284994
With the gully on three sides, she could be approached only along    1.6432600607208703
the tongue of land. "Careful, now", Jones warned.   Means    1.5127085093302464
tried her first. Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding,    1.6065767145351917
edging closer, watching for a chance to throw, but ready to spin and    1.67495327387791
run, rope whining about his head, horse edging tensely under him, but    1.6432600607208703
the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close    1.67495327387791
proximity of the lion. They tell you horses go crazy at the sight    1.67495327387791
or smell of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.   Means edged    1.67495327387791
closer. She snarled warningly. Means spit and edged on. Again she    1.6065767145351917
snarled, and again he edged. The pony was sidewise to her. With a whirling    1.7026049541338664
jump, it could get into gear **h. However nothing on four legs    1.6432600607208703
was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance, unless    1.67495327387791
it was a cheetah.   She charged. Means spun and spurred. For thirty    1.6432600607208703
yards she gained rapidly. She was closing and within one more bound    1.6432600607208703
would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay, but- and    1.7026049541338664
here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they    1.6432600607208703
were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound. Means held    1.6432600607208703
steady one jump ahead of her. Then gradually he began to pull away.    1.67495327387791
A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion, from a standing start.    1.6432600607208703
Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means **h.    1.6432600607208703
Of course the factor of head start made all the difference. How much    1.67495327387791
head start? No one knew exactly. That was the whole question.    1.6065767145351917
Enough, was the answer.   The lioness quickly changed front, when    1.5636360329510388
she saw she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones. As she had    1.67495327387791
done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but then Baldy began    1.6432600607208703
to draw away. Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the    1.7026049541338664
determining point.   When Jones too drew away, she returned to    1.5636360329510388
a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched low    1.7026049541338664
and waited as before. This new position, however, gave the ropers a    1.6432600607208703
better chance. There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and    1.7026049541338664
throw as you went. So: Means edged around on the north side of her,    1.7026049541338664
Jones moved in from the south. Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted    1.67495327387791
her attention. He succeeded almost too well, because once she    1.5636360329510388
rose as if to charge, and he half wheeled his horse- he was within    1.7026049541338664
fifty feet- but she sank back.   From behind her Means shot    1.6065767145351917
forward at a run. Kearton began shouting, "Wait, wait- the camera's    1.6065767145351917
jammed"! But Means kept on. He raced by within twenty feet    1.6065767145351917
of her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck is short and    1.7026049541338664
thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off.    1.6065767145351917
The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was    1.6432600607208703
once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies. But the time    1.6065767145351917
came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was    1.67495327387791
looked upon as deficient in its essential life. The Christian education    1.6065767145351917
of children, too, was once hardly more than a sideshow, but the day    1.67495327387791
came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church    1.67495327387791
school was thought of as failing in its duty.   The most serious    1.6432600607208703
weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally    1.6065767145351917
regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination    1.6432600607208703
and a few interdenominational executives. Most pastors and laymen,    1.5127085093302464
even though they believe it to be important, assume that the ecumenical    1.6432600607208703
movement lies outside the province of their parishes. They may    1.5636360329510388
even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the    1.6432600607208703
"ecclesiastical Rover Boys", as someone has dubbed them, who like    1.5636360329510388
to go to national and international assemblies, and have expense accounts    1.6065767145351917
that permit them to do so.   As long as this point of view    1.67495327387791
prevails, the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt. The next    1.6065767145351917
stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community.    1.7026049541338664
Progress will take place far less through what is done in any    1.6432600607208703
"summit conference" of the National Council or the World Council,    1.5636360329510388
or even in offices of the denominational boards, than through what    1.6065767145351917
happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors.    1.6065767145351917
The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping    1.5636360329510388
congregations of different traditions exist side by side. Until they    1.5636360329510388
see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their    1.67495327387791
own attitudes, programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable    1.5636360329510388
aspect of unreality. As things now stand, there is a grievous disparity    1.6432600607208703
between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings    1.6065767145351917
and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main    1.5636360329510388
Street in the nation.    1.0
The crux    1.0
of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation    1.6432600607208703
between congregations in the same community. The decisive question    1.5127085093302464
is what happens <within> each congregation and, finally, in the    1.5636360329510388
minds and hearts of the individual members. It is here that the local    1.67495327387791
and ecumenical must meet. It is here that the ecumenical must become    1.6432600607208703
local and the local become ecumenical.   It has become almost    1.5636360329510388
trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be "carried down to the    1.67495327387791
grass roots". This way of describing the matter is unfortunate.    1.5636360329510388
It implies two misconceptions. One is that whatever is ecumenical has    1.6065767145351917
to do with some over-all organization at "the top" and needs only    1.6432600607208703
to be understood at the so-called "lower levels". The truth, however,    1.6065767145351917
is that the ecumenical church <is> just the local church in its    1.6432600607208703
own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God    1.67495327387791
throughout the world. The other misconception is that our ecumenical    1.5636360329510388
problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide    1.7026049541338664
extension and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended    1.3761581156320553
by many national leaders, can be communicated to all congregations.    1.5636360329510388
However needed this may be, the fundamental problem is not information    1.6065767145351917
but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ    1.6432600607208703
in the world.   The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational    1.6432600607208703
polity, is always the congregation. It is hardly possible    1.5127085093302464
to emphasize this too much. Most people do not realize that the congregation,    1.67495327387791
as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face, personally    1.5636360329510388
sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience    1.5127085093302464
in daily relationships with one another, is unique. The idea that it    1.6432600607208703
is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken. The Jewish synagogue    1.6432600607208703
affords a parallel to the Christian congregation, but Hinduism,    1.5127085093302464
Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, although they    1.3761581156320553
have sacred scriptures, priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of    1.5127085093302464
prayer, do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and    1.67495327387791
love. Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an    1.6065767145351917
altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with    1.67495327387791
a distinctive kind of fellowship.   How far the fellowship in most    1.6065767145351917
local churches falls below what the New Testament means by <koinonia!>    1.6065767145351917
What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more    1.5636360329510388
than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind    1.6432600607208703
of people one likes. The <koinonia> of Acts and of the Epistles    1.6432600607208703
means sharing in a common relation to Christ. It is an experience of    1.67495327387791
a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate    1.6432600607208703
indwelling of Christ in His people. As Dietrich Bonho^ffer puts    1.5636360329510388
it, "Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ    1.6065767145351917
has done to both of us". This may mean having fellowship in the church    1.7026049541338664
with people with whom, on the level of merely human agreeableness,    1.6065767145351917
we might prefer not to have any association at all. There is a vast    1.7026049541338664
difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament    1.5636360329510388
describes and the community of congeniality found in the average    1.5636360329510388
church building.   Whenever a congregation really sees itself    1.4513752902486308
as a unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with the whole    1.67495327387791
Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world, a necessary    1.67495327387791
foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid. The    1.5127085093302464
antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists. The    1.6432600607208703
local and the ecumenical are one.   Of course, the perspective    1.5636360329510388
of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the    1.6432600607208703
People of God will always be different from the perspective of those    1.6432600607208703
who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a    1.6432600607208703
particular place. Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related    1.6065767145351917
to the other. Neither is adequate if it stands alone. Our difficulty    1.6432600607208703
arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other. And this is what    1.6432600607208703
all too often happens.    1.0
A little parable    1.0
illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor    1.6432600607208703
Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War. With great    1.6432600607208703
difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew    1.67495327387791
his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World    1.6432600607208703
Council of Churches. When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles,    1.6432600607208703
his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new    1.5127085093302464
ones. They were bifocals. He often spoke of them as his "ecumenical"    1.6432600607208703
glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is    1.7026049541338664
required in the church. It is, he said, a bifocal vision, which can    1.67495327387791
see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right    1.67495327387791
relation to both.   As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical    1.6432600607208703
tend to compete with each other. On the one hand, there are    1.6432600607208703
ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter    1.7026049541338664
with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church    1.7026049541338664
is doing in their own town. They do not escape the pitfall into which    1.7026049541338664
Charles Dickens pictured Mrs& Jellyby as falling. Her concern    1.5127085093302464
for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite    1.6065767145351917
forgot and neglected her son Peepy! Likewise, the ecumenist may become    1.6065767145351917
so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian    1.6065767145351917
state in East Germany, the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary    1.6432600607208703
China, and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South    1.6065767145351917
Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its    1.6432600607208703
unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service    1.4513752902486308
and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.   1.6065767145351917
On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering    1.6432600607208703
to the intimate, personal needs of individuals in his congregation    1.5636360329510388
that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social    1.7026049541338664
responsibility and world mission. As a result, they go on thinking    1.6065767145351917
of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction, only    1.5127085093302464
in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families.    1.67495327387791
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of    1.67495327387791
the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual    1.6432600607208703
concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the    1.6065767145351917
members. The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or    1.6432600607208703
the world.   The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the    1.5636360329510388
parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable    1.67495327387791
suburbs. It is eminently successful according to all conventional    1.5127085093302464
standards. It is growing in numbers. Its people are agreeable    1.5636360329510388
friends. It has a beautiful edifice. Its preaching and its music give    1.6432600607208703
refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain. It    1.6432600607208703
provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled. It helps children    1.6065767145351917
grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible. It draws    1.67495327387791
young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the    1.67495327387791
church from generation to generation. And it is easy for the ecumenical    1.6432600607208703
enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.   But what    1.6432600607208703
is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians    1.67495327387791
in the world? All too often its conception of parish ministry    1.6065767145351917
and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation    1.6065767145351917
to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind.    1.6432600607208703
It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with    1.67495327387791
the mind of Christ. It is not helping them face the moral crisis    1.67495327387791
involved in the use of nuclear energy. It is not making them sensitive    1.67495327387791
to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial    1.6065767145351917
life. It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship    1.6432600607208703
means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world    1.6065767145351917
to economically underdeveloped peoples. It is not developing an awareness    1.5636360329510388
of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young    1.67495327387791
churches emerge in Asia and Africa.   To put it bluntly, many    1.6065767145351917
a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want.    1.6432600607208703
It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility    1.6065767145351917
in relation to the world. We shall not make a decisive advance    1.6432600607208703
in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not    1.67495327387791
merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness    1.7269387314284994
and mission to the world.   There is a humorous but revealing    1.6065767145351917
story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted    1.7026049541338664
to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant    1.6432600607208703
community. He built a school and a library, then a recreation center    1.6432600607208703
and an inn. Desiring to fill the only remaining lack, he selected    1.6432600607208703
the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting    1.7269387314284994
it. A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired, "Do    1.5636360329510388
you belong to this church, Mr& Rancher"? "Why, no, ma'am",    1.5636360329510388
he replied, "this church belongs to me"! The story reflects    1.5636360329510388
the way too many people feel. As long as the congregation regards    1.6432600607208703
the church as "our" church, or the minister thinks of it as "my"    1.67495327387791
church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant    1.6065767145351917
advance. There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs    1.6432600607208703
not to us but to Christ, and that it is His purpose, not our own interests    1.748515906000203
and preferences, that determines what it is to be and do.    1.6065767145351917
A local church which conceives its function    1.3761581156320553
to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and    1.6065767145351917
concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an    1.6432600607208703
extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church. It would    1.7269387314284994
doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical    1.67495327387791
it is really failing to be the Church of Christ.   Yet the    1.6432600607208703
truth, according to the New Testament, is that every local church    1.6065767145351917
has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in    1.67495327387791
that particular place.    1.0
Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match    1.748515906000203
the boys from the neighboring farms; and buggies and wagons and chugging    1.6432600607208703
Fords kept gathering all morning, until the edges of the field    1.6065767145351917
were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field    1.67495327387791
to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was a formidable looking    1.6432600607208703
young man with the only baseball cap.   This was a bitterly    1.6065767145351917
fought game, carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight, with no    1.67495327387791
friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness    1.5127085093302464
that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls    1.6432600607208703
that went into the crowd. Every pitch in the game brought forth    1.6432600607208703
a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors    1.6432600607208703
dropped (and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from    1.6432600607208703
drink, they dropped many) called forth yelps of derision.   At    1.5636360329510388
one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting    1.7269387314284994
as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in    1.7269387314284994
the kidneys, he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled    1.6065767145351917
over whether the ball was "dead" or the base runners were    1.6065767145351917
free to score.   This was typical of such games, which were earnestly    1.6432600607208703
played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of    1.6432600607208703
good fellowship. When the visitors, after losing this game, rode along    1.6065767145351917
the village streets toward home, the youngsters who could keep abreast    1.6065767145351917
of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, "You bunch of    1.6432600607208703
hay-shakers! G'ahn back home! You hay-shakers"!   Baseball    1.3761581156320553
was surely the national game in those days, even though professional    1.6065767145351917
baseball may have been merely a business. Radio broadcasts had    1.5636360329510388
not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home,    1.6432600607208703
in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or three trips to the    1.7269387314284994
city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or    1.7026049541338664
the Red Sox.   Young men in school could look forward to playing    1.6432600607208703
ball for money in a dozen different places, even if they failed to    1.67495327387791
make the major leagues. Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might    1.67495327387791
find a payday awaiting him in the Three ~I League, or the Pony    1.67495327387791
League, or the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League,    1.6065767145351917
if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere.    1.7026049541338664
Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams,    1.6065767145351917
sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores,    1.5127085093302464
that played two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually in    1.67495327387791
the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan audience who    1.6432600607208703
did not begrudge a quarter each, or even more, to be dropped into a hat    1.7269387314284994
when the game was half over.   Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's    1.6432600607208703
hero, and everyone knew him, even though relatively few ever    1.5636360329510388
saw him play ball. His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes    1.6432600607208703
in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life. As the twenties grew    1.67495327387791
older, and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more    1.6432600607208703
and more people daily in the doings of the professionals, the great    1.6432600607208703
hitters (always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the game so that pitchers    1.6432600607208703
were nearly of no account. Boys no longer bothered learning to    1.6065767145351917
bunt and even school kids scorned to "choke up" on a bat as Willie    1.7026049541338664
Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.   Other    1.6065767145351917
hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared    1.7269387314284994
to dream of matching Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his    1.67495327387791
friends, or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him (Leo    1.67495327387791
was the name of the ball player he liked the least) and who called most    1.7269387314284994
of the world "Kid". Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster,    1.6065767145351917
and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs. But the nickname never    1.7026049541338664
stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in "color"- which is sometimes    1.67495327387791
a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field. Ruth    1.6432600607208703
was a delinquent boy still, but he was in every way a great ball    1.7026049541338664
player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone    1.7026049541338664
to do it.   A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities,    1.5636360329510388
with the encouragement of the press, so that they might    1.5636360329510388
see their names in big black print, along with Daddy Browning's,    1.6065767145351917
Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince of Wales'. One    1.5636360329510388
who, for a time, succeeded    1.1606783668269585
best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles    1.5636360329510388
Arthur Shires, who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the    1.5636360329510388
Great, or The Great Shires. It was his brag that he could beat    1.67495327387791
everybody at anything, but especially at fighting, and he once took on    1.6432600607208703
the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists.    1.67495327387791
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;    1.7026049541338664
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles    1.6432600607208703
in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First    1.67495327387791
Baseman for some forgotten reason. (This made a sportswriter named    1.5636360329510388
Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated    1.67495327387791
his manager.) The sorry fact about this young man, who was barely    1.6432600607208703
of age when he broke into major-league baseball, was that he really    1.6432600607208703
was a better ball player than he was given credit for being- never so    1.7026049541338664
good as he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates, but a    1.67495327387791
good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate    1.6432600607208703
on his skills or cut up in public.   In his minor way Charles    1.67495327387791
Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was, for    1.67495327387791
he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these    1.7269387314284994
Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers.    1.6432600607208703
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down;    1.6065767145351917
or who ingested strange objects, like live fish; or who undertook    1.6065767145351917
to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with or without    1.67495327387791
a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without    1.67495327387791
pausing for breath. One young man, exhilarated to the point of insanity    1.6432600607208703
by liquor and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect    1.6065767145351917
swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army    1.67495327387791
football game, landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below,    1.6432600607208703
and died at once.   But the twenties were not all insanity and    1.6432600607208703
a striving after recognition. The business of baseball began to prosper    1.6065767145351917
along with other entertainments, and performers- thanks partly to    1.5127085093302464
George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his    1.5636360329510388
salary higher and higher- prospered too. While fifty years before,    1.5636360329510388
Albert Goodwill Spalding, secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of    1.5636360329510388
the National League, could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo    1.6432600607208703
club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball    1.6432600607208703
game in August, in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium    1.67495327387791
might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate. And    1.6432600607208703
while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox- all of them    1.67495327387791
top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy Charles    1.5636360329510388
Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five    1.5636360329510388
hundred dollars a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars,    1.6065767145351917
twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars a season.   1.5636360329510388
The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New    1.5636360329510388
York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club    1.6432600607208703
by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins. Boston fans sometimes    1.6065767145351917
liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the    1.7026049541338664
great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox- sold to millionaires    1.6432600607208703
Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most    1.67495327387791
trifling desire. Ruth himself, still owning his farm in Massachusetts    1.5636360329510388
and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed    1.5636360329510388
his round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade down from Fenway    1.7026049541338664
Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays, Leslie "Joe" Bush,    1.5127085093302464
Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam Jones, catcher Wally Schang,    1.5636360329510388
third baseman Joe Dugan (who completed the "playboy trio" of    1.5636360329510388
Ruth, Dugan, and Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott. By 1926, when    1.6065767145351917
the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of these were    1.67495327387791
left but they still shone brightest, even beside able and agile rookies    1.6432600607208703
like Tony Lazzeri (who managed never to have one of his epileptic    1.6432600607208703
fits on the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras, and    1.6065767145351917
gray-thatched Earl Combs. The deeds of this team, through two seasons    1.6065767145351917
and in the two World's Series that followed, have been written    1.6065767145351917
and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said. But there    1.7026049541338664
is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in    1.7269387314284994
the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to    1.67495327387791
recall. Babe Ruth, as he always did in the Stadium, played right field    1.67495327387791
to avoid having the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather    1.67495327387791
mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St& Louis Cardinals,    1.5636360329510388
knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the    1.7026049541338664
permanent stands and the wooden bleachers, where Ruth could not reach    1.6065767145351917
it. The ball lay there, shining white on the grass in view of nearly    1.7026049541338664
every fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration, charged    1.6065767145351917
about the small patch of ground screaming, "Where's the -ing    1.5636360329510388
ball"? But, as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over,    1.6065767145351917
"not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me", so little Tommy    1.6432600607208703
ran all the way home.   The ordinary man and woman, however, saw    1.6432600607208703
little of the great professional games of those Golden Days, or of    1.6432600607208703
any other sporting event for that matter. Promoters always hastened    1.5636360329510388
to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators,    1.6432600607208703
and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in    1.748515906000203
with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest    1.7677783654484436
of any importance. Radio broadcasts, however- now that even plain    1.5636360329510388
people could afford "loud speakers" on their sets- held old    1.5636360329510388
fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones, chiefly women,    1.6065767145351917
who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition,    1.6065767145351917
became first inured, then attracted, then addicted to the long    1.5636360329510388
afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.   1.5636360329510388
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on    1.6432600607208703
weekends the announcer was silenced, and fans must needs drive to the    1.6432600607208703
city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.    1.67495327387791
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well    1.6432600607208703
as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies, some of which began    1.7026049541338664
to offer special excursion rates, including seats at the park, just    1.6065767145351917
as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new.    1.6065767145351917
While women had always attended ball games in small numbers (it was the    1.67495327387791
part of a "dead game sport" in the early years of the twentieth    1.67495327387791
century to be taken out to the ball park and to root, root, root for    1.7269387314284994
the home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom, unable even to    1.67495327387791
read the scoreboard, which sometimes seemed to indicate that one    1.5636360329510388
team    1.0
led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and    1.7026049541338664
fifty-one. The questions women asked at baseball games were standard    1.5636360329510388
grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women automobile drivers;    1.6432600607208703
for every grown man (except a few who were always suspected of    1.6432600607208703
being shy on virility) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just    1.6432600607208703
as every male American in this era liked to imagine (or pretend) that    1.67495327387791
he could fight with his fists. And women were not expected to know    1.67495327387791
that the pitcher was trying <not> to let the batter hit the ball.   1.67495327387791
Radio, however, so increased the interest of women in the game    1.6065767145351917
that it was hardly necessary even to have "Ladies' Days" any longer    1.6432600607208703
to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home.    1.67495327387791
Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where    1.5636360329510388
they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice    1.6432600607208703
stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.   1.67495327387791
The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative,    1.5127085093302464
despite the baseball jargon, that girls and women could begin to    1.6065767145351917
store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics    1.67495327387791
that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their    1.6432600607208703
lessons in school.    1.0
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores    1.6065767145351917
will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the "ideal",    1.5636360329510388
and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for    1.5127085093302464
preserving the ideal.   Our discussion of this involves using    1.5127085093302464
Erik Erikson's schema of "identity <vs&> identity diffusion"    1.4513752902486308
as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto    1.6065767145351917
the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers    1.5636360329510388
from whose case histories we quoted earlier. Our discussion does not    1.6065767145351917
utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended    1.6065767145351917
to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying    1.5636360329510388
unwed mothers. We hope thereby to emphasize that, from a psychological    1.6065767145351917
standpoint, the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous    1.5127085093302464
long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy    1.5636360329510388
through adolescence.   Hypothesizing a series of developmental    1.3761581156320553
stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old    1.6432600607208703
age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series    1.6432600607208703
of identity crises. The successful and positive resolution of these    1.5636360329510388
crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during    1.4513752902486308
adolescence, the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity    1.5636360329510388
crisis depend, to a considerable degree, on his already having    1.5636360329510388
resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy,    1.5127085093302464
childhood, and early adolescence. Within Erikson's schema, the    1.4513752902486308
adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case, her unwed motherhood-    1.5127085093302464
reflects her "identity diffusion", or her inability to resolve    1.5127085093302464
these various identity crises positively.   <The adolescent    1.3761581156320553
experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs& time diffusion>.    1.6065767145351917
Time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and    1.5636360329510388
to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range    1.5636360329510388
objectives- is more easily developed if, from infancy on, the individual    1.6065767145351917
has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which    1.7026049541338664
she lives. Erikson has noted that, unless this trust developed early,    1.6065767145351917
the time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and temporarily,    1.5127085093302464
by all adolescents (as a result of their remembering the more immediate    1.6432600607208703
gratification of wants during childhood, while not yet having fully    1.5636360329510388
accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood) may develop    1.5127085093302464
into a more permanent sense of time diffusion. Experience of this time    1.6432600607208703
diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate    1.67495327387791
urgency to act immediately.   These polar extremes in time    1.5127085093302464
diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported    1.6432600607208703
in earlier chapters. Some of these mothers, apparently feeling a    1.5636360329510388
desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the moment, commitments, in love    1.6432600607208703
and sex, that would have life-long consequences. Others displayed    1.5127085093302464
utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future.    1.67495327387791
For many of these unwed mothers, the data on their family life    1.6432600607208703
and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources    1.5127085093302464
of their    1.0
basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in    1.6432600607208703
general.   However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's    1.4513752902486308
failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood    1.5127085093302464
need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of    1.6432600607208703
identity diffusion in his (or her) adolescence. And, as shown in Chapter    1.6432600607208703
/6,, some ~SNP females originally developed such trust only    1.5127085093302464
during their adolescence, through the aid of, and their identification    1.5636360329510388
with, alter-parents. In the specific case of time diffusion, we    1.5636360329510388
must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust    1.5636360329510388
<when it is combined with> the inevitable time crisis experienced by    1.6065767145351917
most (if not all) adolescents in our society, and with the failure of    1.67495327387791
the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.   1.5127085093302464
<The adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty    1.4513752902486308
vs& an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation    1.2818970554302986
vs& negative identity>. A sense of self-certainty and the freedom    1.5636360329510388
to experiment with different roles, or confidence in one's own unique    1.6065767145351917
behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity, is more easily    1.5636360329510388
developed during adolescence if, during early childhood, the individual    1.5127085093302464
was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some    1.5636360329510388
autonomy.   However, if the child has been constantly surrounded,    1.5127085093302464
during nursery and early school age, by peer groups; inculcated    1.5636360329510388
with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed    1.6065767145351917
little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence    1.6065767145351917
her normal degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with    1.5127085093302464
whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable, will be compounded.    1.6065767145351917
Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions    1.4513752902486308
and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence    1.5127085093302464
are the manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been indoctrinated    1.6065767145351917
in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt, for failing to behave    1.6432600607208703
in a manner acceptable to, and judged by, the performance of her nursery-    1.67495327387791
and elementary-school peer friends. To be different is to invite    1.5636360329510388
shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's    1.7026049541338664
parents, who already consider one different and difficult to understand,    1.5636360329510388
than by one's peers, who are also experiencing a similar groping    1.6065767145351917
for and denial of adult status.   The attitudes of some unwed    1.6065767145351917
mothers quoted in Chapter /2,, revealed both considerable preoccupation    1.5127085093302464
with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.    1.6065767145351917
Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable    1.5636360329510388
means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but    1.5636360329510388
very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need    1.5636360329510388
to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and    1.6065767145351917
with one's self.   <Another identity crisis confronting the    1.4513752902486308
adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs& work-paralysis>.    1.3761581156320553
The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise    1.5127085093302464
the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends    1.4513752902486308
on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy, initiative, and    1.6432600607208703
self-discipline during childhood. The developmental process involves    1.3761581156320553
the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement    1.5636360329510388
resulting from having completed tasks, having kept commitments,    1.4513752902486308
and having created something (however small or simple- even a doll    1.6065767145351917
dress of one's own design rather than in the design "it ought    1.6432600607208703
to be"). These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty    1.5636360329510388
that the adolescent needs, for experimenting with many roles, and    1.5636360329510388
for the <freedom to fail sometimes> in the process of exploring and    1.6432600607208703
discovering her skills and abilities.   If she has not had such    1.6065767145351917
experiences, the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will    1.5127085093302464
be compounded. She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted    1.67495327387791
with present and future alternatives- e&g&, whether to prepare    1.5127085093302464
primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker; whether    1.6432600607208703
to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself    1.6065767145351917
while attending school; whether to pursue a college education or a    1.6065767145351917
job after high school; and whether to attend this or that college and    1.67495327387791
to follow this or that course of study. Erikson has noted that, as    1.67495327387791
this indecision mounts, it may result in a "paralysis of workmanship".    1.6065767145351917
This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and    1.5636360329510388
never completing- many jobs, tasks, and courses of study; and in    1.6065767145351917
the fact that she bases her decisions about work, college, carreer, and    1.6432600607208703
studies on what others are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity    1.7026049541338664
with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes. The absence,    1.5127085093302464
during her childhood and early adolescence, of experiences in developing    1.5636360329510388
the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences    1.5127085093302464
that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement-    1.5636360329510388
and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy    1.5127085093302464
and initiative in play and expression, both tend in her adolescence    1.6065767145351917
to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally    1.6432600607208703
in experimenting.   The comments made by some unwed mothers    1.5127085093302464
(quoted in Chapter /2,) reflect this paralysis of workmanship. They    1.5636360329510388
attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions    1.6065767145351917
others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available,    1.6065767145351917
convenient, and paid reasonably. These things both express and,    1.5127085093302464
at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity diffusion    1.5636360329510388
in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and    1.67495327387791
self-certainty. As their identity diffusion increased, they became more    1.5127085093302464
susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs. These    1.5636360329510388
affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities    1.5636360329510388
containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship,    1.5127085093302464
no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.   Childhood    1.6065767145351917
experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context    1.5636360329510388
of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance    1.4513752902486308
for the prevention of illegitimacy. The excerpts from case histories    1.5636360329510388
presented above confirm this significance, though through different    1.4513752902486308
facets of experience. For example, some unwed mothers had had no work    1.6432600607208703
experiences, household chores, and responsibilities during childhood    1.3761581156320553
and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours    1.5127085093302464
in searching for something exciting and diverting. Sex was both. On    1.6065767145351917
the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility    1.67495327387791
imposed on them at an early age, and had thus had so little freedom    1.7026049541338664
or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work    1.5636360329510388
and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped    1.5636360329510388
and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden    1.5127085093302464
sexual behavior.   <The adolescent also faces the identity    1.4513752902486308
crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs& diffusion    1.5127085093302464
of ideals>. In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations    1.6432600607208703
for the prevention of illegitimacy, we shall again superimpose    1.5127085093302464
Erikson's concept on our data.   Adolescents have a much-discussed    1.5127085093302464
tendency to polarize ideas and values, to perceive things as    1.5636360329510388
"either-or", black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively    1.5127085093302464
unimportant. This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in the    1.5636360329510388
literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents. Erikson    1.5127085093302464
has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily    1.3761581156320553
resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly    1.6065767145351917
changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood.    1.4513752902486308
It provides identification- with an idea, a value, a cause that    1.6065767145351917
cuts through, or even transcends, the multiple and ambivalent identities    1.5636360329510388
of their passage from child to adult, and permits their forceful    1.6065767145351917
and overt expression of emotion.   The positive development, during    1.5127085093302464
adolescence, of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with    1.6432600607208703
increasing independence, and to identify overtly either with or against    1.5636360329510388
given ideas, values, and practices, depends to a considerable degree    1.5636360329510388
on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy,    1.5127085093302464
initiative, and self-certainty. Most adolescents have some ideological    1.4513752902486308
diffusion at various developmental stages, as they experience a proliferation    1.5636360329510388
of ideas and values. The diffusion is most pronounced and    1.5636360329510388
most likely to become fixed, however, in those who have had no or very    1.7026049541338664
minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could    1.5636360329510388
have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources    1.6065767145351917
of developing self-certainty.   A pronounced ideological    1.2818970554302986
diffusion- i&e&, inability to <identify independently> with given    1.4513752902486308
ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways. For example,    1.6065767145351917
it is evinced by the adolescent (or adult) whose beliefs and actions    1.6432600607208703
represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior    1.6065767145351917
patterns of others, rather than his inner conviction and choice.    1.5636360329510388
It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and    1.6065767145351917
behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide    1.6065767145351917
with those of the individual or group present and most important    1.6065767145351917
at the moment. In another sense, it is represented in the arguments    1.6432600607208703
of the "true believers" who seek to disprove the validity of all    1.6432600607208703
other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.   1.6065767145351917
The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological    1.5127085093302464
diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's inability to <identify    1.5127085093302464
independently> with a given value system or behavior pattern, and    1.5636360329510388
her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility    1.4513752902486308
for her sexual behavior. For example, the unwed mothers expressed    1.5636360329510388
their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly "what    1.6065767145351917
it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly".    1.67495327387791
They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital    1.6065767145351917
sexual intercourse. They condemned the movie script writers for implying    1.5636360329510388
that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating. They criticized parents    1.5127085093302464
for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong;    1.5636360329510388
and they censured parents who "never disciplined and were too permissive"    1.6065767145351917
or who "never explained how easy it was to get pregnant".   1.6065767145351917
In the adult world, there are a number of rather general and    1.6432600607208703
diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the    1.5127085093302464
adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis.    1.5127085093302464
For example, some contemporary writing tends to fuse the "good    1.5636360329510388
guys" and the "bad guys", to portray the weak people as heroes and    1.67495327387791
weakness as a virtue, and to explain (or even justify) asocial behavior    1.6432600607208703
by attributing it to deterministic psychological, familial, and social    1.5127085093302464
experiences.    1.0
In the final accounting, these would have augmented the bill for both    1.6432600607208703
sides. An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.   1.6065767145351917
Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation,    1.6065767145351917
which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly contributed to constructive    1.5127085093302464
changes in legal procedure. The duration and other circumstances    1.5127085093302464
of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of    1.7026049541338664
patent infringement actions. The suit, as we have seen, came before    1.6065767145351917
the courts when patent attorneys, inventors, and laymen were making mounting    1.6065767145351917
demands for reforms in the American patent system. Chief among    1.5636360329510388
the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures    1.6065767145351917
in equity.   In a long and angry footnote to his opinion,    1.6065767145351917
Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism.    1.6432600607208703
"It is a duty", said Hough, "not to let pass this opportunity    1.6432600607208703
of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony    1.5636360329510388
in Equity, current in this circuit (and probably others), excused    1.5636360329510388
if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court, especially to    1.6432600607208703
be found in patent causes, and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation.    1.6065767145351917
As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition,    1.6432600607208703
rather than <viva voce> before an authoritative judicial officer,    1.5127085093302464
I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged, and expensive    1.6065767145351917
prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity". Observing    1.5127085093302464
that "reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible    1.5127085093302464
examples", Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing    1.5127085093302464
procedures. He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case    1.5636360329510388
record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous    1.5127085093302464
squabbles over minor matters; the "objections stated at outrageous    1.5127085093302464
length"; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts, "uncalled    1.5127085093302464
for and    1.0
unjustifiable, from the retort discourteous to the lie direct".   1.5127085093302464
The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was    1.5127085093302464
"a striking (though not singular) example", concluded Hough, "will    1.5127085093302464
remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial    1.6065767145351917
officer present, and responsible for the maintenance of discipline,    1.5127085093302464
and the reception or exclusion of testimony".   Not least    1.5127085093302464
among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment    1.6432600607208703
were those who had participated in the Selden suit. William A&    1.6065767145351917
Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under    1.67495327387791
rules of evidence, the testimony would have been completed in sixty    1.6065767145351917
days instead of five years. Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for    1.6432600607208703
reform, inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a "horrible    1.5636360329510388
example". Its costive deliberations were likened to those of    1.5127085093302464
the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in    1.5636360329510388
<Bleak House>.   Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism,    1.5636360329510388
did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects. But    1.5127085093302464
he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried. In a detailed    1.67495327387791
letter published in the <Scientific American> in 1912, he    1.5127085093302464
remarked that "loose statements" about the case showed scant understanding    1.5636360329510388
of the facts. The suit, although commonly designated as a single    1.6065767145351917
action, actually embraced five cases. Parker insisted that the size    1.5636360329510388
of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable    1.6432600607208703
duplication of testimony.   In a private communication written    1.4513752902486308
in 1911, Parker had been more to the point. Noting the complaints    1.6432600607208703
of inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted that some    1.6432600607208703
of the strictures "were fairly well founded", but he added that under    1.6432600607208703
existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group    1.6065767145351917
of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent. The    1.5636360329510388
vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit, as well as the    1.67495327387791
complex character of the automotive art, encouraged both sides to exploit    1.6065767145351917
"every possible chance" for or against the patent, said Parker.    1.5636360329510388
"This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases, and    1.6432600607208703
of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the    1.7269387314284994
record beyond what ordinarily would occur".   Parker listed the    1.5127085093302464
remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony.    1.6432600607208703
The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's    1.6065767145351917
plea for reform. Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate    1.5636360329510388
or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court    1.6065767145351917
who had no authority to limit testimony. The taking of depositions,    1.6065767145351917
he suggested, should be placed under a special court examiner empowered    1.6065767145351917
to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial    1.5636360329510388
testimony. "I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power    1.6432600607208703
existed and this course [been] pursued, it would have shortened    1.5636360329510388
the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of    1.67495327387791
the other witnesses thereto more than that".   In the end Hough's    1.6065767145351917
acidulous protest, which Parker called the "now somewhat famous    1.5127085093302464
note on this 'Selden' case", did not go unheeded. In 1912    1.6065767145351917
the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity    1.67495327387791
which became effective on February 1, 1913. The revised procedure    1.5636360329510388
was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform. Under the new rules, testimony    1.6065767145351917
is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary    1.7026049541338664
character. Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent    1.4513752902486308
prolixity, limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement suits.    1.5636360329510388
One of the A&L&A&M& lawyers observed that if the Selden    1.5636360329510388
case had been tried under this simplified procedure, the testimony    1.5636360329510388
which filled more than a score of volumes, "at a minimum cost of $1    1.7026049541338664
a page for publication alone, could have been contained in one volume".    1.6432600607208703
While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive    1.6065767145351917
forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums    1.5636360329510388
of money. There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme    1.67495327387791
Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit.    1.5636360329510388
Even    1.0
before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the A&L&A&M&    1.5127085093302464
was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade, the direct lineal    1.6065767145351917
ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association.    1.3761581156320553
The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A&L&A&M&    1.6065767145351917
were more representative, for they never adopted a policy of exclusion.    1.6065767145351917
Nevertheless, it is from the Selden organization that the industry    1.5636360329510388
inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests    1.5127085093302464
of the trade. One of the chief features of this community of interest    1.67495327387791
is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone    1.4513752902486308
in the development of American industrial cooperation. Its origin    1.5127085093302464
lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath.   From    1.5636360329510388
the earliest days of the motor car industry, before the A&L&A&M&    1.6065767145351917
was established, patent infringement loomed as a serious and    1.5127085093302464
vexing problem. Many patent contests were waged over automobile components    1.5636360329510388
and accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball bearings,    1.5127085093302464
license brackets, and electric horns. The fluidity and momentum of    1.5636360329510388
the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims. As    1.6065767145351917
early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with    1.6065767145351917
the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers.    1.5127085093302464
This scheme failed, and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement    1.6432600607208703
suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest    1.4513752902486308
in 1912.   In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing    1.5636360329510388
scheme adopted by the A&L&A&M& at its founding proved    1.5127085093302464
to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant    1.67495327387791
litigation. The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty    1.5636360329510388
eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A&L&A&M&    1.5127085093302464
patent pool (although it did not protect them against outside    1.5636360329510388
actions) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive    1.5636360329510388
technology. One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition    1.6065767145351917
upon the withholding of patent rights among A&L&A&M& members.    1.5127085093302464
Within its limits, this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics    1.6065767145351917
of a cross-licensing agreement. Its positive features    1.3761581156320553
outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly.    1.67495327387791
Since the A&L&A&M& holdings embraced only about twenty-five    1.4513752902486308
per cent of motor vehicle patents, the denial of rights to independent    1.6432600607208703
companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors    1.5127085093302464
of the industry. The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding    1.6065767145351917
gear transmission were held by the A&L&A&M& pool. But Henry    1.5636360329510388
Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model ~T and earlier    1.6065767145351917
cars and, in 1905, as a precautionary measure, took out a license    1.6432600607208703
from the man who claimed to be its inventor.   For those affiliated    1.6432600607208703
with it, the A&L&A&M& pool was a haven from the infringement    1.6065767145351917
actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting    1.5636360329510388
intensity after 1900. By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases,    1.6065767145351917
many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions.    1.6065767145351917
It was commonplace for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers    1.5127085093302464
to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their    1.6065767145351917
daily mail. "Purely from the business man's standpoint and without    1.5636360329510388
regard to the lawyer's view", commented a trade journal, "the    1.5636360329510388
matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing    1.6065767145351917
some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents    1.6432600607208703
are to become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple beneficient    1.6432600607208703
protection devices for encouraging inventive creation".   1.2818970554302986
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain    1.5127085093302464
prospect of legal complications. One manufacturer who held an allegedly    1.5636360329510388
basic patent said: "I would readily put over $50,000 into the    1.6065767145351917
manufacture of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would enter    1.7269387314284994
immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would    1.5636360329510388
eat up all our profits". The prevailing view in the industry was    1.6432600607208703
summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee:    1.7269387314284994
"The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions,    1.3761581156320553
including delays surrounding legal disputes, particularly in patent    1.4513752902486308
litigation, are items of industrial burden which must be written    1.5636360329510388
large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste".   1.6065767145351917
By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping    1.6432600607208703
constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical    1.5127085093302464
information. At this point Charles C& Hanch, long an advocate    1.5636360329510388
of patent peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents committee    1.6432600607208703
of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, successor    1.4513752902486308
to the Automobile Board of Trade. Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke    1.6432600607208703
+ Marmon Company, an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling    1.5127085093302464
machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904. He had    1.5636360329510388
first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety    1.6065767145351917
per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's.    1.67495327387791
Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry,    1.6065767145351917
Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading    1.6432600607208703
A&L&A&M& members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan.    1.3761581156320553
The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but Hanch    1.6432600607208703
did not abandon his scheme.   After the demise of the A&L&A&M&,    1.6065767145351917
the time was propitious for establishing such a pool.    1.5127085093302464
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal    1.6432600607208703
interchange of patents. "It is a much easier course to agree to    1.6432600607208703
let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned", said    1.6432600607208703
a trade authority, "than to continue the costly effort of straightening    1.6065767145351917
the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system,    1.6432600607208703
which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day".   1.5636360329510388
With the other members of the patents committee- Wilfred C& Leland,    1.6065767145351917
Howard E& Coffin, Windsor T& White, and W& H&    1.5127085093302464
Vandervoort- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential    1.4513752902486308
feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution. The    1.5127085093302464
plan was supported by Frederick P& Fish, counsel for the National    1.6065767145351917
Automobile Chamber of Commerce. It will be recalled that in his    1.6065767145351917
summation for the A&L&A&M& before Judge Hough, Fish had    1.5127085093302464
condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial    1.5636360329510388
community. He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used    1.6432600607208703
their patents solely for nuisance value. "My personal view is that    1.6065767145351917
not one patented invention in ten is worth making", he later told    1.6432600607208703
a Congressional committee. The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed    1.5127085093302464
the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.   1.67495327387791
Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement became    1.4513752902486308
effective in 1915. It remained in force for ten years and has been    1.67495327387791
renewed at five-year intervals since 1925.    1.2818970554302986
A little farther along the road you come to the {Church of Santa    1.67495327387791
Sabina,} called the "Pearl of the Aventine". Continue another    1.5127085093302464
hundred yards to the {Piazza of the Knights of Malta.} On the    1.6432600607208703
wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments.    1.6065767145351917
The massive {gate} of the Maltese villa affords one of    1.5636360329510388
the most extraordinary views in Rome. If you look through the keyhole,    1.6432600607208703
you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome    1.6065767145351917
of St& Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.   1.6432600607208703
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via di Santa Sabina and    1.67495327387791
turn right on the {Via di S& Alessio,} a street lined with    1.6432600607208703
stately homes. Oleanders, cypress, and palms in the spacious gardens    1.5636360329510388
add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section. Turn    1.6065767145351917
left a block or so before the street ends, and then turn right down    1.7026049541338664
the Via di Santa Prisca to the {Viale Aventino.} Here you can    1.6432600607208703
pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city.    1.7269387314284994
_TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_    1.2818970554302986
These two walks take you through the {heart of Rome.} You will    1.6432600607208703
walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed in by massive <palazzi>.    1.6432600607208703
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed,    1.6432600607208703
a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish    1.5127085093302464
Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied places,    1.6065767145351917
both interesting and beautiful, you will become aware of the many    1.6065767145351917
different civilizations Rome has lived through, and in particular, get    1.5636360329510388
a feel of Renaissance Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed    1.6432600607208703
the Eternal City.   Start on the Via d& Teatro di Marcello    1.6065767145351917
at the foot of the {Capitoline Hill.} The majestic circular    1.5636360329510388
tiers of stone of the {Theatre of Marcellus} give you some idea    1.6432600607208703
of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B&C&.    1.6432600607208703
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days.    1.5636360329510388
Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled    1.5636360329510388
his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.   Wander past    1.5636360329510388
the three superb {Columns of Apollo} by the arches of the theatre.    1.6432600607208703
The remains of the {Portico of Octavia} are now in front of    1.6432600607208703
you. Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di    1.67495327387791
Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo.    1.6065767145351917
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli,    1.67495327387791
then proceed along the Via dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei. Here    1.6432600607208703
is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome, the {Fontana delle    1.6065767145351917
Tartarughe} or {"Fountain of the Tortoises".} It's typical    1.4513752902486308
of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find    1.7026049541338664
such an artistic work in the center of a little square. Stand here    1.67495327387791
for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths,    1.748515906000203
each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head    1.67495327387791
of a dolphin. The figures have been executed so skillfully that one    1.6432600607208703
senses a great feeling of life and movement.   Opposite is the    1.6065767145351917
{Palazzo Mattei,} one of Rome's oldest palaces, now the headquarters    1.5636360329510388
of the {Italo-American Association.} Go inside for a closer    1.5127085093302464
look at a Renaissance palace. In the first courtyard there are    1.6065767145351917
some fine bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series of delightful    1.67495327387791
terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall. The {Palazzo    1.5127085093302464
Caetani,} still inhabited by the Caetani family, adjoins the Palazzo    1.5636360329510388
Mattei.   Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross    1.5127085093302464
the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the {Piazza B&    1.6432600607208703
Cairoli,} where you should look in at the {Church of San Carlo    1.6432600607208703
ai Catinari} to see the frescoes on the ceiling. Follow the colorful    1.6432600607208703
and busy Via d& Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so. Now turn    1.67495327387791
left at the Via dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini.    1.67495327387791
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro will    1.7026049541338664
bring you to the {Palazzo Spada,} built in 1540 and now occupied    1.6432600607208703
by the {Council of State.} Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio,    1.5127085093302464
and Rubens are on display (open 9:30-4:00).   Before you enter    1.5636360329510388
the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's facade. The great architect    1.5127085093302464
also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which    1.5127085093302464
connects the two courts. The large statue on the first floor is believed    1.67495327387791
to be the {statue of Pompey} at the base of which Julius Caesar    1.67495327387791
was stabbed to death (if so, the statue once stood in the senate    1.67495327387791
house). (This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)   1.6065767145351917
By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard Borromini's    1.6065767145351917
unusual and fascinating trick in perspective. When you stand before    1.5636360329510388
the barrel-vaulted {colonnade} you have the impression that the statue    1.5636360329510388
at    1.0
the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few    1.7026049541338664
feet away. The sense of perspective has been created by designing the    1.6432600607208703
length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade    1.7026049541338664
are much shorter than those in front. The gardens of the <palazzo,>    1.6432600607208703
shaded by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard    1.6065767145351917
is magnificently decorated.   From the Palazzo Spada you continue    1.5127085093302464
another block along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti    1.6432600607208703
to the imposing {Palazzo Farnese,} begun in 1514 and considered    1.5636360329510388
by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo was the most distinguished    1.7026049541338664
of several noted architects who helped design it. Today it    1.5636360329510388
is occupied by the {French Embassy.} Its lovely seventeenth-century    1.5127085093302464
ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously    1.6432600607208703
high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays    1.5636360329510388
(11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris    1.5636360329510388
and Rome designed by Lurcat.   Directly in front of the palace    1.6065767145351917
along the Via d& Baullari you will come to the {Campo di Fiori,}    1.67495327387791
the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance    1.6065767145351917
Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit,    1.6065767145351917
vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the Via d& Baullari to    1.6065767145351917
the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred    1.6432600607208703
yards to the {Church of Sant' Andrea della Valle.} As you    1.6065767145351917
approach the church on the Via d& Baullari you are passing within    1.6432600607208703
yards of the remains of the {Roman Theatre of Pompey,} near which    1.6432600607208703
is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated.    1.6432600607208703
The dome of the church is, outside of {St& Peter's,}    1.5636360329510388
one of the largest in Rome. Opera lovers will be interested to learn    1.67495327387791
that this church was the scene for the first act of <Tosca>.   1.6432600607208703
At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele /2,,    1.6065767145351917
walk along the Corso del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards,    1.6065767145351917
then turn left on the Via dei Canestrani to enter the splendid {Piazza    1.67495327387791
Navona,} one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.   Your    1.5636360329510388
first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains,    1.6065767145351917
its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored    1.6065767145351917
buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly    1.4513752902486308
welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have    1.6432600607208703
followed since starting this walk.   The site of the oblong    1.5636360329510388
piazza is {Domitian's ancient stadium,} which was probably used    1.5127085093302464
for horse and chariot races. For centuries it was the location of historic    1.67495327387791
festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth to    1.5127085093302464
the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in    1.67495327387791
the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated    1.6065767145351917
square in their carriages.   Giovanni Bernini's {"Fountain    1.3761581156320553
of the Rivers",} in the center of the piazza, is built around    1.6432600607208703
a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes    1.6432600607208703
and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner, denoting four    1.6432600607208703
great rivers from different continents- the Danube, the Ganges, the    1.5636360329510388
Nile, and the Plate. The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered,    1.7026049541338664
perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure    1.6432600607208703
from her sight the baroque facade of the {Church of Sant' Agnese    1.6432600607208703
in Agone}, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini.    1.4513752902486308
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can    1.6432600607208703
sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch the fountains in the square. The    1.7026049541338664
scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about    1.6432600607208703
Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.   1.6432600607208703
Take the Via di S& Agnese in Agone, next to the church    1.6432600607208703
and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about    1.6432600607208703
two hundred yards to reach the beautiful {Church of Santa Maria della    1.6432600607208703
Pace.} Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael    1.6065767145351917
and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's cloisters    1.5127085093302464
are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations.   Now    1.4513752902486308
return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the    1.7026049541338664
Corsia Agonale; in a moment cross the Corso del Rinascimento.    1.5636360329510388
In front of you is the {Palazzo Madama,} once belonging to the    1.6432600607208703
Medici and now the {Italian Senate.} Walk by the side of the    1.6432600607208703
palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come    1.6432600607208703
to the {Piazza della Rotonda.} You are now facing the {Pantheon,}    1.6065767145351917
the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the    1.5127085093302464
days of ancient Rome.   This circular edifice, constructed by    1.5127085093302464
Agrippa in B&C& 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor    1.67495327387791
Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century.    1.6065767145351917
As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the    1.67495327387791
Temple of Isis, you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian    1.5636360329510388
columns.   The Pantheon's interior, still in its original    1.4513752902486308
form, is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its {rotunda}    1.5636360329510388
forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from    1.6432600607208703
the floor to the ceiling. The only means of interior light is the    1.67495327387791
twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous {dome.} Standing    1.3761581156320553
before the tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance, when    1.6432600607208703
shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple, you are    1.6065767145351917
once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of    1.5636360329510388
Rome.   As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to    1.6065767145351917
the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to {Sant' Ignazio,}    1.6065767145351917
one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city. (Along the way    1.67495327387791
there, about one hundred yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant,    1.67495327387791
{La Sacrestia,} where you can have the best pizza in Rome.)    1.6065767145351917
The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church    1.6065767145351917
seems like a stage set. This is one of the most charming little    1.67495327387791
squares in this part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in    1.7026049541338664
front of the church) will bring you to the {Stock Exchange} in    1.6432600607208703
the old {Temple of Neptune.} A few yards farther, on the Via    1.6432600607208703
dei Bergamaschi, is the {Piazza Colonna.} The great column from    1.5636360329510388
which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus    1.6432600607208703
Aurelius.   You are now at the {Corso,} though narrow, one    1.5636360329510388
of Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here in the Middle    1.6432600607208703
Ages.   If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have    1.67495327387791
the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso    1.6432600607208703
for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings-    1.67495327387791
mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the    1.5127085093302464
{Palazzo Doria} (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00-1:00).    1.4513752902486308
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where    1.6432600607208703
the family still lives.   Otherwise, cross over the Corso and    1.5636360329510388
walk a block or so to the left. You will come to {Alemagna,} a    1.7026049541338664
delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly    1.4513752902486308
noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries.    1.5636360329510388
Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the    1.67495327387791
place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome. _TO THE SPANISH    1.7026049541338664
STEPS_ The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken    1.6432600607208703
after lunch, so that you will reach the {Pincian Hill} when    1.6065767145351917
the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best.    1.6065767145351917
Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church    1.6065767145351917
member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale    1.67495327387791
to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality. I myself    1.5636360329510388
have witnessed and endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers    1.6432600607208703
also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And this is not,    1.67495327387791
perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward    1.5636360329510388
black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they    1.5636360329510388
are nearly all downtown.)   It is hard, on the other hand, to blame    1.67495327387791
the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably    1.3761581156320553
innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves.    1.6432600607208703
He, too, believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended    1.6065767145351917
when they are not taken for the deed. He has never, himself, done    1.67495327387791
anything for which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is    1.7026049541338664
facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly see him dead, and he    1.67495327387791
knows it. There is no way for him not to know it: there are few things    1.748515906000203
under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt    1.5127085093302464
and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore, like    1.6065767145351917
an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely    1.6065767145351917
what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes.    1.7269387314284994
And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company:    1.7269387314284994
the people who are watching him know why, too. Any street meeting,    1.6432600607208703
sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as    1.6432600607208703
its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white    1.6432600607208703
domination. And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and    1.6065767145351917
jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination. The white policeman    1.6432600607208703
standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center    1.6432600607208703
of the revolution now occurring in the world. He is not prepared    1.6432600607208703
for it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much more to the    1.67495327387791
point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the    1.7026049541338664
black people around him. Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard    1.67495327387791
grain of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid observing    1.6065767145351917
that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of    1.67495327387791
children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children. He    1.67495327387791
knows that he certainly does not want <his> children living this    1.6065767145351917
way. He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into    1.6432600607208703
a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature. He becomes more    1.6065767145351917
callous, the population becomes more hostile, the situation grows    1.5127085093302464
more tense, and the police force is increased. One day, to everyone's    1.6432600607208703
astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything    1.6065767145351917
blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials,    1.6432600607208703
speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding    1.5636360329510388
to know what happened. What happened is that Negroes want to    1.6065767145351917
be treated like men.   <Negroes want to be treated like men:>    1.6065767145351917
a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words.    1.4513752902486308
People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud,    1.5127085093302464
and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems    1.6065767145351917
to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic    1.5636360329510388
paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on    1.5636360329510388
the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe to a very well-known    1.7269387314284994
American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South.    1.5127085093302464
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me    1.6432600607208703
in perfect innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South    1.6065767145351917
move North"? I tried to explain what <has> happened, unfailingly,    1.5636360329510388
whenever a significant body of Negroes move North. They do not    1.6065767145351917
escape Jim Crow: they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly    1.4513752902486308
variety. They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side;    1.67495327387791
they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure    1.67495327387791
within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion    1.6432600607208703
is always violent. White people hold the line as long as they can,    1.67495327387791
and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical    1.67495327387791
violence. But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from    1.6065767145351917
the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto. The white    1.7026049541338664
people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make    1.6065767145351917
a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but    1.7026049541338664
dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood    1.6065767145351917
turns into a "turf". This is precisely what happened when the Puerto    1.6432600607208703
Ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused    1.5636360329510388
is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.   1.67495327387791
Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury. They seem    1.5127085093302464
to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil    1.67495327387791
War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going    1.7026049541338664
on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it; and    1.6065767145351917
that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what    1.6432600607208703
is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse. Well, in the    1.6432600607208703
first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both    1.67495327387791
to know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the South and    1.67495327387791
white Southerners, because "At least there, you haven't got to    1.5636360329510388
play any guessing games"! The guessing games referred to have driven    1.6065767145351917
more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the    1.6432600607208703
river. I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with    1.7026049541338664
conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South is the spirit    1.6432600607208703
of America". He was born in the North and did his military training    1.67495327387791
in the South. He did not, as far as I can gather, find the South    1.7269387314284994
"worse"; he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the    1.6065767145351917
second place, though, even if Birmingham <is> worse, no doubt    1.5636360329510388
Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald    1.5636360329510388
was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history    1.67495327387791
of the world. The world has never lacked for horrifying examples;    1.6065767145351917
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification    1.7269387314284994
for our own crimes. This perpetual justification empties    1.4513752902486308
the heart of all human feeling. The emptier our hearts become, the greater    1.67495327387791
will be our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly    1.6432600607208703
backward region, but a part of this country, and what happens    1.6065767145351917
there concerns every one of us.   As far as the color problem    1.6432600607208703
is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern    1.6065767145351917
white and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically and    1.5127085093302464
in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and    1.7269387314284994
they loved him. Historically, the flaming sword laid across this Eden    1.6065767145351917
is the Civil War. Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual    1.5636360329510388
coming of age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos are set    1.6065767145351917
up between himself and his past. Everything, thereafter, is permitted    1.5636360329510388
him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need. The resulting,    1.7026049541338664
indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the    1.5127085093302464
basis of the Southern hysteria.   None of this is true for the    1.6432600607208703
Northerner. Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps,    1.5127085093302464
the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners    1.5127085093302464
see them all the time. Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners    1.6432600607208703
are never really thinking of anything else. Negroes are,    1.5127085093302464
therefore, ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South,    1.6432600607208703
and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner nor    1.5636360329510388
the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man. It seems    1.7269387314284994
to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be    1.6065767145351917
considered either as a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many    1.7269387314284994
Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few,    1.5127085093302464
comparatively,    1.0
were lynched), or as a victim (in which case we are promised    1.6432600607208703
that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our    1.7026049541338664
kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change-    1.7269387314284994
<cannot> change- until the North changes. The country will    1.5127085093302464
not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really    1.6065767145351917
means by freedom. In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness    1.6065767145351917
is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks    1.6065767145351917
around us.   It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one    1.6065767145351917
cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own:    1.5636360329510388
in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the    1.6432600607208703
streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become.    1.6065767145351917
 THE    1.0
FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U&N& while Adlai    1.5636360329510388
Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white    1.5636360329510388
Americans. Stevenson's speech, and the spectacular disturbance    1.3761581156320553
in the gallery, were both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the    1.67495327387791
day before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the course of    1.6065767145351917
his address, that the United States was "against" colonialism. God    1.5636360329510388
knows what the African nations, who hold 25 per cent of the voting    1.67495327387791
stock in the U&N& were thinking- they may, for example, have    1.6065767145351917
been thinking of the U&S& abstention when the vote on Algerian    1.6065767145351917
freedom was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly accurate    1.67495327387791
notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking. I had    1.6432600607208703
intended to be there myself. It was my first reaction upon hearing    1.6432600607208703
of Lumumba's death. I was curious about the impact of this political    1.6432600607208703
assassination on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured    1.5636360329510388
the popular imagination there. I was curious to know if Lumumba's    1.6065767145351917
death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events,    1.6065767145351917
would elicit from "our" side anything more than the usual, well-meaning    1.6065767145351917
rhetoric. And I was curious about the African reaction.   1.5127085093302464
However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U&N&    1.6432600607208703
gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the eyes of most Americans,    1.67495327387791
would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists. The    1.67495327387791
climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of    1.67495327387791
the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding    1.6065767145351917
self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were "Communist"    1.6432600607208703
inspired. Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent    1.4513752902486308
Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U&N& rioters    1.6065767145351917
do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community.    1.5636360329510388
According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters    1.67495327387791
were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted <provocateurs>.   1.4513752902486308
I find this view amazing. It is a view which even    1.6065767145351917
a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict. One    1.5127085093302464
has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions.    1.67495327387791
The first question is: Would <I> like to live here?    1.5636360329510388
And the second question is: Why don't those who now live here move    1.67495327387791
out? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless    1.5636360329510388
one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that Negroes    1.5636360329510388
are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can    1.67495327387791
escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is    1.6065767145351917
not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.   Now,    1.6065767145351917
I do not doubt that, among the people at the U&N& that day, there    1.7026049541338664
were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the    1.5127085093302464
most cynical motives. Wherever there is great social discontent, these    1.5636360329510388
people are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is not as    1.67495327387791
frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity. What    1.5127085093302464
I find appalling- and really dangerous- is the American assumption    1.5636360329510388
that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical    1.7026049541338664
agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest. It is a notion    1.7026049541338664
which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes    1.6065767145351917
can make no move unless they are manipulated.    1.4513752902486308
Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until the early fifties.   1.6432600607208703
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction    1.5636360329510388
of the primitive movies of the nineties. Each film consisted of fifty    1.6432600607208703
feet, which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen.    1.67495327387791
As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason    1.67495327387791
to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores    1.5127085093302464
in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can    1.6432600607208703
still be found in such urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of    1.67495327387791
actual events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes. The sensational    1.5636360329510388
and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at    1.5127085093302464
the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats. An    1.67495327387791
early Edison production was <The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots>.    1.6065767145351917
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung    1.5127085093302464
his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An early film by    1.67495327387791
a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss    1.67495327387791
performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.   In the field    1.6065767145351917
of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective    1.6065767145351917
as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over    1.7026049541338664
before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded,    1.6065767145351917
one-minute shows. In response, the industry allowed the discovery    1.5127085093302464
of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies    1.7026049541338664
the essential form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer    1.6432600607208703
beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films, and travelogues,    1.5636360329510388
despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development    1.5636360329510388
as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the    1.67495327387791
play, the novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically    1.6065767145351917
successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative    1.5636360329510388
form from the fiction feature. Thus such great American documentaries    1.5636360329510388
as <The River> and <The Plow That Broke the Plains>    1.5636360329510388
were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.    1.5636360329510388
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early    1.7026049541338664
years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French    1.7026049541338664
magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin    1.5636360329510388
S& Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for    1.6432600607208703
he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the    1.7026049541338664
first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion    1.6432600607208703
picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained    1.5636360329510388
since, even in the most inept hands.    1.3761581156320553
Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician,    1.5636360329510388
discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain    1.6432600607208703
part of the vocabulary of film. One of these is the "dissolve",    1.6432600607208703
which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene.    1.6065767145351917
As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins    1.6065767145351917
to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously,    1.6432600607208703
one growing weaker, one growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales    1.6432600607208703
and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped    1.5636360329510388
to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications,    1.6065767145351917
resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions. Immediately, the    1.2818970554302986
film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content    1.6432600607208703
based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time.    1.6065767145351917
Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected    1.6432600607208703
one at a time at such a speed that the eye "remembers" the one    1.7026049541338664
that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing. Linking    1.67495327387791
the smoothly changing images together, the eye itself endows them    1.5636360329510388
with the illusion of movement. The "projection" time of painting    1.5636360329510388
and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and    1.6065767145351917
even varying for a given person on different occasions. So is the time    1.67495327387791
of the novel. The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall    1.7026049541338664
both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the    1.7269387314284994
players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore,    1.4513752902486308
to much variation, as record collectors well know. The time of the motion    1.67495327387791
picture is fixed absolutely. The film consists of a series of still,    1.6432600607208703
transparent photographs, or "frames", 35-mm&-wide. Each frame    1.3761581156320553
comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected    1.6065767145351917
on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second,    1.7026049541338664
and, for sound films, 24 frames per second. This is the rate of projection;    1.7026049541338664
it is also the rate of photographing. Time is built into    1.6065767145351917
the motion picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time is also    1.6432600607208703
the concern of the fictional narrative, which is, at its simplest,    1.6065767145351917
the story of an action with, usually, a beginning, a middle, and an end-    1.7026049541338664
elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence.    1.6065767145351917
The "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at the    1.6432600607208703
audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same    1.7026049541338664
subject, but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic    1.6065767145351917
element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which    1.7026049541338664
would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo. In narrative,    1.6065767145351917
time is essential, as it is in film. Almost everything about the    1.6432600607208703
movies that is peculiarly <of> the movies derives from a tension created    1.6432600607208703
and maintained between narrative time and film time. This discovery    1.5636360329510388
of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling,    1.5636360329510388
magician's tricks produced on film.   It was Porter, however,    1.5127085093302464
who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the    1.67495327387791
half century of film history that has since ensued. The movie was <The    1.67495327387791
Great Train Robbery> and its effects on the young industry and    1.6065767145351917
art were all but incalculable. Overnight, for one thing, Porter's    1.5636360329510388
film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten. <The    1.6065767145351917
Great Train Robbery> is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to    1.6432600607208703
twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of <Robbery>,    1.6065767145351917
1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with <Birth of    1.5636360329510388
a Nation> in 1915. The reel itself became and still is the standard    1.67495327387791
of measure for the movies.   The material of the Porter film    1.6065767145351917
is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the    1.67495327387791
years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old West-    1.7269387314284994
pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's. A    1.6065767145351917
band of robbers enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the    1.6432600607208703
telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed    1.6432600607208703
and pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape, are whooping    1.6065767145351917
it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers    1.67495327387791
run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot    1.67495327387791
dead by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the    1.7269387314284994
band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.   1.6065767145351917
All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did    1.6432600607208703
two important things that had not been done before. Each scene is shot    1.67495327387791
straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed    1.6432600607208703
in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the    1.6432600607208703
capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position    1.5127085093302464
breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which    1.5636360329510388
had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at    1.67495327387791
a play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the    1.7269387314284994
plane of the film in the camera or on the screen. If the change, at    1.7269387314284994
first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters    1.67495327387791
about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian    1.6432600607208703
painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of    1.5636360329510388
geniuses any art has seen. In that apparently simple shift Porter    1.6065767145351917
opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of    1.7026049541338664
art as well as a mechanical recording device.   He did more than    1.6432600607208703
that. He revealed the potential value of the "cut" as the basic    1.6432600607208703
technique in the art of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically    1.67495327387791
in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word is quite    1.67495327387791
physical, to begin with. The physical film is cut with a knife at the    1.7026049541338664
end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically,    1.6432600607208703
by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence. If,    1.7026049541338664
as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable footage of your child    1.67495327387791
taking its first steps, you have merely recorded an historical event.    1.6065767145351917
If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends,    1.6432600607208703
you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's    1.67495327387791
grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in    1.6432600607208703
film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.   1.6432600607208703
This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the looted    1.6065767145351917
train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's    1.6432600607208703
little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only    1.5127085093302464
to find him bound on the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two    1.7026049541338664
events are taking place at the same time. Time and space have both become    1.7026049541338664
cinematic. We leap from event to event- including the formation    1.5636360329510388
of the posse- even though the events, in "reality" are taking    1.6065767145351917
place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but    1.6432600607208703
at a considerable distance.   The "chase" as a standard film    1.5636360329510388
device probably dates from <The Great Train Robbery>, and there    1.5636360329510388
is a reason for the continued popularity of the device. The chase in    1.67495327387791
itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands    1.67495327387791
cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage    1.6065767145351917
of the journey of both. The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another    1.7026049541338664
is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other    1.7269387314284994
form of fiction. The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and    1.6432600607208703
the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not    1.6065767145351917
only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence;    1.7026049541338664
these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively    1.5636360329510388
or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.    1.5127085093302464
There    1.0
still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full    1.67495327387791
potential of the new form and to make it an art. The man was D&W&    1.7269387314284994
Griffith. When he came to the movies- more or less by accident-    1.6432600607208703
they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking    1.5636360329510388
for an idle few minutes. In about seven years Griffith either    1.6065767145351917
invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource    1.5636360329510388
at the disposal of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith    1.6432600607208703
had created the art of the film.   Not that there had not been    1.67495327387791
attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that. But in general the European    1.6432600607208703
efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly    1.6432600607208703
emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly condensed versions    1.5127085093302464
of famous novels and famous plays were presented. Great actors    1.5636360329510388
and actresses- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired    1.5636360329510388
to repeat their stage performances before the camera. In all of this    1.6432600607208703
extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status    1.6065767145351917
of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor    1.6065767145351917
or by the author. The phonograph today, for all its high fidelity    1.6432600607208703
and stereophonic sound, is precisely what the early art purveyors in    1.6065767145351917
the movies wished to make of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach    1.6432600607208703
did not work. The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques    1.6432600607208703
in the early years of the century and some interesting records    1.6065767145351917
of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names. But no art    1.67495327387791
at all was born of the art effort in the early movies.    1.6432600607208703
In general, religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis;    1.67495327387791
congregational membership, however, is another thing. A congregation    1.4513752902486308
survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;    1.5636360329510388
that is, when it can preserve economic integration. Religious    1.5127085093302464
faith can be considered a <necessary> condition of membership in    1.5636360329510388
a congregation, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires    1.6065767145351917
some motive force, but faith is not a <sufficient> condition for joining;    1.6432600607208703
the presence of other members of similar social and economic    1.5636360329510388
level is the <sufficient> condition.   The breakdown of social    1.5127085093302464
homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account    1.67495327387791
for the decline of central city churches. Central cities reveal    1.5636360329510388
two adverse features for the major denominations: (1) central cities    1.5636360329510388
tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; (2) central    1.6432600607208703
cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition. The central    1.6065767145351917
city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics which    1.5636360329510388
violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations:    1.5636360329510388
they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people    1.5636360329510388
with lower-class residents. Central city areas have become progressively    1.5127085093302464
poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus    1.5127085093302464
of middle-class people from most central cities. With few exceptions,    1.5636360329510388
the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central    1.6065767145351917
city.   The key to Protestant development, therefore, is economic    1.5127085093302464
integration of the nucleus of the congregation. Members of higher    1.5636360329510388
and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus, so that Protestant    1.6432600607208703
figures on social class give the impression of spread over all    1.6065767145351917
social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core of membership    1.6065767145351917
is    1.0
concentrated in a single social and economic stratum. The congregation    1.5636360329510388
perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the    1.67495327387791
neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so high in metropolitan    1.5127085093302464
areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum    1.6065767145351917
in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members    1.6065767145351917
from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits    1.5636360329510388
for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration. The    1.6065767145351917
congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is    1.6065767145351917
secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily    1.5636360329510388
a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social    1.5636360329510388
and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism    1.6065767145351917
(with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do.    1.6065767145351917
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.   1.6065767145351917
The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences    1.4513752902486308
has often been attributed to the "folksy spirit" of Protestant    1.5636360329510388
religious life; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard    1.6432600607208703
with the "impersonal" Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that    1.5636360329510388
the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently, the    1.5636360329510388
vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress    1.6065767145351917
on personal community in Protestant congregations; actually, there    1.4513752902486308
is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations,    1.5636360329510388
as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability of    1.5636360329510388
Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of    1.5636360329510388
the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is    1.6065767145351917
a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore,    1.6432600607208703
to the principle of economic integration. This fact is evident    1.5636360329510388
in the recruitment of new members.    1.2818970554302986
The    1.0
rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the    1.6432600607208703
missionary outreach of the major denominations. There is much talk    1.5636360329510388
in theological circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's    1.6065767145351917
Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact that    1.4513752902486308
the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in    1.7026049541338664
the world for the healing of the world. A crucial question, therefore,    1.6432600607208703
is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism.    1.5636360329510388
If economic integration really shapes congregational life, then    1.4513752902486308
evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration.    1.5127085093302464
The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration,    1.6432600607208703
as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar    1.5636360329510388
social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.    1.6432600607208703
(Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to    1.5636360329510388
fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power    1.67495327387791
from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.) In a    1.6065767145351917
mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of    1.5636360329510388
recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of    1.5127085093302464
economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore,    1.5127085093302464
the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation    1.6065767145351917
rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.   1.5636360329510388
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been    1.3761581156320553
carefully studied in the churches; one study in Pittsburgh, however,    1.5636360329510388
has illuminated the situation. In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh    1.6432600607208703
churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts    1.5636360329510388
with friendly members". If we add to these contacts with friendly    1.6065767145351917
members the "contacts with an organization of the church" (11.2    1.5636360329510388
per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment    1.67495327387791
is through friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound    1.6065767145351917
approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation show by    1.5636360329510388
their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people    1.6432600607208703
respond in kind by joining the church.   Missionary outreach    1.5127085093302464
by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what    1.6065767145351917
is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority    1.5636360329510388
of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic    1.6065767145351917
position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle    1.5636360329510388
of informal relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation    1.6065767145351917
are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths    1.5636360329510388
of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation;    1.7026049541338664
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal    1.6065767145351917
co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people    1.6065767145351917
who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.    1.5636360329510388
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long    1.6065767145351917
as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people    1.6432600607208703
who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits    1.67495327387791
diminishes, the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no    1.4513752902486308
longer keep it going.   The transmutation of mission to co-optation    1.5636360329510388
is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities,    1.5127085093302464
worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members. The    1.5127085093302464
proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts    1.6065767145351917
by the clergy (17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts    1.6432600607208703
by members (over two thirds if organizational activities are included).    1.5636360329510388
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with    1.6065767145351917
new members. In general, friendly contact with a member followed by    1.6065767145351917
contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment    1.6432600607208703
by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic    1.6432600607208703
integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission    1.5127085093302464
in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are    1.5127085093302464
the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from    1.6065767145351917
the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will prosper so long    1.6065767145351917
as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize    1.6065767145351917
together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability    1.4513752902486308
of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as    1.6432600607208703
the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the    1.7269387314284994
membership. Economic integration ceases when the social and economic    1.5127085093302464
statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of    1.67495327387791
the congregation. In a rapidly changing society congregations will run    1.5636360329510388
into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration    1.5636360329510388
are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single    1.6432600607208703
generation. The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations    1.5636360329510388
have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred    1.5127085093302464
years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle    1.6065767145351917
to maintain economic balance. The expense of this type of organization    1.6065767145351917
in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which    1.6432600607208703
deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental    1.4513752902486308
questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile    1.5636360329510388
society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations    1.5127085093302464
illumines the nature of the Protestant development.    1.3761581156320553
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had    1.6065767145351917
split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal    1.5127085093302464
basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends    1.5636360329510388
seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. Residential    1.5636360329510388
associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions.    1.3761581156320553
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential    1.5127085093302464
communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb,    1.5636360329510388
Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as    1.6432600607208703
symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis.    1.5636360329510388
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved    1.6065767145351917
with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize    1.6065767145351917
the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings.    1.4513752902486308
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the    1.5127085093302464
drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. This    1.5636360329510388
conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable    1.5636360329510388
environment. More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the    1.4513752902486308
churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan    1.6065767145351917
life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of    1.3761581156320553
peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world    1.6432600607208703
of heterogeneous peoples.   Since American life is committed    1.4513752902486308
above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the    1.6432600607208703
countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have    1.4513752902486308
fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence    1.5127085093302464
of the metropolis. Consumer communities have suffered at the hands    1.5636360329510388
of the productive interests. Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural    1.5127085093302464
newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. Soon they will    1.6432600607208703
fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches    1.6065767145351917
will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized    1.6065767145351917
their history for a century. The identification of the basic unit    1.6065767145351917
of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a    1.5127085093302464
residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply    1.6065767145351917
means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian    1.67495327387791
fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. Mission    1.5127085093302464
to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential    1.6065767145351917
community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan    1.4513752902486308
interdependence with residential exclusion.   This interpretation    1.2818970554302986
of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could    1.6432600607208703
lead to various projections for the churches. It could be argued    1.6065767145351917
that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed    1.5636360329510388
to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the    1.6432600607208703
middle classes. It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain    1.6432600607208703
religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities.    1.4513752902486308
Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational    1.5127085093302464
and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the    1.7026049541338664
social identity of middle-class people.   Attention will be given    1.5127085093302464
in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational    1.6432600607208703
churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the    1.5127085093302464
communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes of this style are    1.6432600607208703
activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. These    1.5127085093302464
values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating    1.67495327387791
the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community    1.5636360329510388
participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of    1.5127085093302464
middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major    1.5636360329510388
denominations. "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly    1.4513752902486308
contact" form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its contents    1.5636360329510388
are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued    1.6065767145351917
by the congregation. What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention    1.67495327387791
under the rubric of the organization church. An understanding    1.5127085093302464
of the new role of residential association in an industrial society    1.6065767145351917
serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of    1.6432600607208703
conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.   1.5127085093302464
The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes    1.6065767145351917
turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs    1.67495327387791
and charities should fill the same need.    1.3761581156320553
With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course    1.6065767145351917
to pursue.   The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who    1.5127085093302464
had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company.    1.67495327387791
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt    1.5127085093302464
with the Indians through <engages>, who might be <habitants, voyageurs>,    1.5636360329510388
or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of    1.6432600607208703
one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to    1.7026049541338664
company stores and shipped to France in company ships. The company    1.6065767145351917
disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.   1.67495327387791
In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish    1.6065767145351917
presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians. The lavish    1.6065767145351917
use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade    1.6065767145351917
of New France and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change    1.6432600607208703
in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men. Traders    1.6432600607208703
from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty    1.6065767145351917
turned to them. Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded,    1.5636360329510388
and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian    1.6065767145351917
insurrections that brought ruin to the company.   In 1721    1.5127085093302464
the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do    1.6432600607208703
all that was necessary to protect the colony. They ordered the raising    1.6432600607208703
of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They    1.6432600607208703
adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts.    1.6065767145351917
In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading    1.7269387314284994
depot to supply the smaller trading houses. For southeastern    1.5127085093302464
Louisiana,    1.0
Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies    1.6065767145351917
for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British    1.67495327387791
traders. Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending    1.67495327387791
northward to the sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse,    1.5636360329510388
on the Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas    1.7026049541338664
and Choctaws, but money was available for only one other new    1.6065767145351917
post, near the present Nashville, Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.   1.6065767145351917
West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi    1.5127085093302464
district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent upon it    1.5636360329510388
were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers    1.67495327387791
of New Spain.   On the middle Mississippi a principal    1.5127085093302464
post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped    1.7026049541338664
that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west,    1.7026049541338664
principally down the Arkansas River. On the Ohio or Wabash was to    1.6432600607208703
be built another post "at the fork of two great rivers". Other    1.6432600607208703
posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication    1.6432600607208703
with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was    1.5636360329510388
to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built    1.6432600607208703
on the Missouri, "where there are mines in abundance".    1.5127085093302464
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible    1.6432600607208703
to a director-general at New Orleans. An elaborate system of accounting    1.6065767145351917
and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the    1.7026049541338664
most scientific way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision    1.5636360329510388
of the directors. <Engages> must be loyal to the concessionaires,    1.5636360329510388
and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended.    1.6432600607208703
The <habitants> were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose    1.6432600607208703
of their pelts to the concessionaires.   Only two principal storehouses    1.5636360329510388
were actually established- one at Mobile, the other at New    1.5636360329510388
Orleans. New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi,    1.6432600607208703
and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash. Mobile    1.6432600607208703
was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district.   1.6432600607208703
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration    1.5127085093302464
cannot be determined. Regulations for the Indian trade were    1.5127085093302464
made by the <Conseil superieure de la Louisiane>, and Bienville    1.5636360329510388
apparently did not have control of that body. The <Conseil> even    1.6065767145351917
treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and,    1.6065767145351917
on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise "suitable    1.5636360329510388
for the peltry trade". It decided, also, that the purely secular    1.6065767145351917
efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to    1.5127085093302464
win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.   During the first    1.5636360329510388
administration of Bienville, the peltry trade of the Mobile district    1.5636360329510388
was a lucrative source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually    1.6065767145351917
15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought    1.5636360329510388
the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins were the raw material    1.6432600607208703
for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the    1.6432600607208703
tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods.    1.5636360329510388
During his first administration, Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina    1.5127085093302464
traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country. The    1.6065767145351917
director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French    1.6432600607208703
goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian    1.67495327387791
needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which    1.6065767145351917
goods could be moved quickly and cheaply. De la Laude, commander    1.6065767145351917
of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able    1.67495327387791
to make them look upon the British as poor competitors. Diron d'Artaguette,    1.6432600607208703
the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and    1.5636360329510388
resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors.    1.6432600607208703
He became, after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama    1.6432600607208703
River, but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district,    1.5636360329510388
and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade.   The    1.6065767145351917
Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district.    1.6065767145351917
Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama,    1.6432600607208703
the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was    1.5127085093302464
easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees. In 1720 some    1.6065767145351917
Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them, and did not    1.5636360329510388
make peace for four years. Venturesome traders, however, continued to    1.5636360329510388
come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts    1.67495327387791
for the French markets. British traders from South Carolina incited    1.5636360329510388
the Indians against the French, and there developed French and    1.5636360329510388
British Factions in the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion    1.6065767145351917
for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana.    1.6065767145351917
To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they    1.6432600607208703
controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile.    1.6432600607208703
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region,    1.6432600607208703
from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French    1.6432600607208703
settlements near the Gulf.   Bienville realized that if the French    1.5636360329510388
were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British    1.6065767145351917
goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant    1.6432600607208703
as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices. His urgings brought    1.5636360329510388
some results. The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply    1.67495327387791
of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms    1.6432600607208703
of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians    1.6065767145351917
must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation    1.67495327387791
into and out of the Indian country.   The insistence of Bienville    1.6065767145351917
upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive    1.6065767145351917
back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall    1.67495327387791
in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained    1.6065767145351917
as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance.    1.6432600607208703
Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders,    1.6065767145351917
and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.   1.5636360329510388
The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina,    1.6432600607208703
and when Perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special    1.67495327387791
instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the    1.5636360329510388
Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements    1.67495327387791
to furnish better goods at attractive prices. To the directors    1.5636360329510388
the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier    1.5636360329510388
attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among    1.6065767145351917
the Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference between    1.5636360329510388
English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians. They    1.6065767145351917
were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to    1.5636360329510388
incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were    1.6065767145351917
to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant    1.7026049541338664
supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering.    1.6432600607208703
Perier's intrigues gained some successes. The savages divided    1.4513752902486308
into two factions; one was British and the other, French. So hostile    1.6432600607208703
did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke    1.6065767145351917
out.   Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective    1.5127085093302464
in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided    1.6432600607208703
to send troops into the troubled country. He asked the government    1.6065767145351917
for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest    1.6432600607208703
English traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's    1.5636360329510388
restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory. He asked    1.6432600607208703
also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians'    1.67495327387791
pelts.   No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation,    1.6065767145351917
gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette.    1.6432600607208703
D'Artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many    1.5636360329510388
hunters. But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon    1.67495327387791
French trade in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one    1.67495327387791
last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent    1.748515906000203
above the cost in France. The Indians were not impressed and held    1.6432600607208703
to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the    1.6432600607208703
Mississippi.   With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended    1.5636360329510388
all profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted. They destroyed    1.5636360329510388
a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed French shipping    1.6065767145351917
on the Mississippi. The war to subdue them taxed the resources    1.6065767145351917
of the colony and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the company    1.67495327387791
asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony.    1.6432600607208703
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently    1.67495327387791
blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered    1.6065767145351917
to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity.    1.6065767145351917
The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the    1.6065767145351917
company at 1,450,000 livres. Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana    1.5127085093302464
was free to all Frenchmen.   Company rule in Louisiana left the    1.6065767145351917
colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties    1.5127085093302464
of trade had ruined many <voyageurs>, and numbers of them    1.5636360329510388
had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families. Others    1.6432600607208703
left the country, and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade.    1.67495327387791
If this trade should be resumed, the <habitants> who had come    1.6065767145351917
to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must    1.6432600607208703
be hardened to the severe life of <coureurs de bois>. This was a    1.67495327387791
slow and difficult course, and French trade suffered from the many mistakes    1.6432600607208703
of the new group of traders. These men were without capital or    1.6432600607208703
experience.   Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either    1.4513752902486308
to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown    1.7026049541338664
furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts    1.6065767145351917
with pelts. Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected    1.6065767145351917
that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing    1.5636360329510388
a trade in which they could see no hope of profits. He reported, too,    1.7026049541338664
that among the <habitants> there were none of probity and ability    1.6065767145351917
sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did    1.6065767145351917
find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers    1.6065767145351917
to trade. With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all    1.67495327387791
the traders.   In order to compete with English traders, Bienville    1.5636360329510388
radically changed the price schedule. The King should expect    1.5127085093302464
no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France,    1.7269387314284994
which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all    1.6065767145351917
he charged the traders.    1.0
They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned    1.7026049541338664
a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense.    1.6065767145351917
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if    1.5636360329510388
it were the source of such reports. Few things are more perilous for    1.67495327387791
the State Department than a displeased congressman.   The reason    1.5127085093302464
for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends    1.6432600607208703
so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are    1.6432600607208703
so available. First, the State Department is unique among government    1.5636360329510388
agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers may be aroused    1.6432600607208703
if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget. Businessmen    1.5127085093302464
will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department.    1.4513752902486308
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department; the    1.5127085093302464
Chamber of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope of    1.5636360329510388
pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly    1.6065767145351917
toward the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The congressman's    1.5636360329510388
patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense    1.5636360329510388
Department. Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every    1.5127085093302464
voter who can write.   With all these agencies, the congressman    1.5636360329510388
must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.    1.6065767145351917
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon    1.6065767145351917
the State Department in anger.   In many sections he may even    1.6065767145351917
reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson. After    1.67495327387791
all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer,    1.67495327387791
or the businessman, but to <foreigners>. Not only do these foreigners    1.6065767145351917
not vote for American congressmen; they are also probably    1.5127085093302464
ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department    1.6065767145351917
men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders    1.5127085093302464
who have never met a payroll? Will not the righteous congressman    1.6065767145351917
be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America    1.7026049541338664
and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes?    1.7269387314284994
The chances are excellent that he will.   The result is    1.5636360329510388
that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is    1.5127085093302464
the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever    1.67495327387791
the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People in this    1.67495327387791
position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the    1.6432600607208703
newspapers. State keeps the junketeering list a secret.   The    1.5127085093302464
Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion.    1.6065767145351917
Congress is a harsh master. State is expected to arrange the    1.6065767145351917
touring Cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected    1.4513752902486308
to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers    1.7026049541338664
are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with    1.6065767145351917
their savings for the children's college tuition.   But come    1.5127085093302464
the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer    1.6432600607208703
guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money    1.67495327387791
for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for    1.5636360329510388
its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his    1.6065767145351917
wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will    1.6432600607208703
systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance    1.5127085093302464
for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.   1.6065767145351917
In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during    1.5636360329510388
the Eisenhower years was Representative John J& Rooney, of    1.5127085093302464
Brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses.    1.5127085093302464
Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful    1.5636360329510388
coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing    1.5636360329510388
worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of    1.5127085093302464
techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around- friendly persuasion,    1.5636360329510388
groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful    1.4513752902486308
congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic    1.5636360329510388
corps. Rooney remained untouched.   "The trouble" explained    1.3761581156320553
Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration,    1.3761581156320553
"is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing,    1.67495327387791
it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we    1.67495327387791
do".   One year the Department collected a file of case histories    1.6065767145351917
to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's    1.67495327387791
entertainment bills out of personal income. News of the    1.5127085093302464
project reached the press. Next day, reports went through the Department    1.6065767145351917
that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt    1.6432600607208703
to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances    1.5636360329510388
and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not    1.6432600607208703
rise a dollar. They didn't.   The Department's constant    1.4513752902486308
fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic    1.7026049541338664
bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional    1.4513752902486308
power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries    1.5636360329510388
a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's    1.7026049541338664
back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.   With    1.6065767145351917
its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by    1.6065767145351917
keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it    1.6432600607208703
did with Dean Acheson. John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his    1.6065767145351917
personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then    1.6432600607208703
operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition. During    1.6065767145351917
Dulles's first two years in office, while Republicans ran the    1.5636360329510388
Senate, the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for    1.67495327387791
its    1.0
blood since 1945.   An internal police operation managed by Scott    1.5636360329510388
McLeod, a former F&B&I& man installed as security officer    1.5127085093302464
upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance. So was    1.5636360329510388
the attack upon Charles E& Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him    1.5636360329510388
Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler, however, was Senator    1.5127085093302464
Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle    1.5636360329510388
for the Department, Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates.    1.5636360329510388
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats,    1.5636360329510388
Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men    1.5127085093302464
had their way.   In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede    1.5636360329510388
that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention    1.67495327387791
by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him    1.5636360329510388
and the country's foreign policy. In any event, the example of Acheson's    1.6432600607208703
trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke    1.5636360329510388
it. He elected to "get along".   During this dark chapter    1.5636360329510388
in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas    1.5636360329510388
later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol    1.6432600607208703
Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious    1.6065767145351917
logic of the time, with present treasonous intent. Their successors,    1.5636360329510388
absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.   This,    1.6432600607208703
in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats    1.6432600607208703
took control. In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually    1.6432600607208703
barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit    1.6065767145351917
the Russians. For three or four years in the mid-1950's, this    1.6065767145351917
complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there    1.6065767145351917
was a dull legislative afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault    1.67495327387791
was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by    1.6065767145351917
anyone but himself.   An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth    1.6065767145351917
of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying    1.6432600607208703
THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign    1.0
embassies and legations in Washington. They range from the Soviet    1.5636360329510388
Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a    1.5636360329510388
funeral-accessories    1.0
display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called    1.4513752902486308
"that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street", the modern cement-and-glass    1.4513752902486308
chancery of the Belgians.   Here is the world of the    1.5636360329510388
chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers    1.6065767145351917
and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher,    1.6432600607208703
and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired    1.67495327387791
Lothario.   Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries    1.5636360329510388
around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions    1.5636360329510388
on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies.    1.6432600607208703
Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty,    1.6432600607208703
the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner.    1.6065767145351917
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting    1.6432600607208703
to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington.    1.6065767145351917
Some, like the British and the French, maintain an elaborate    1.5636360329510388
system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special    1.5636360329510388
areas of the American scene. Other embassies cable home <The    1.5636360329510388
New York Times> without changing a comma.   Each has its peculiar    1.6065767145351917
style. The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage    1.5636360329510388
headquarters. When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over    1.4513752902486308
in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change    1.6432600607208703
this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a ~TV announcer's    1.5127085093302464
grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's astonishment he seemed    1.5636360329510388
no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt    1.5636360329510388
was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.   Where his predecessors    1.4513752902486308
had glowered, Menshikov smiled. Where they had affected the    1.5127085093302464
bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, Menshikov went abroad    1.5127085093302464
gorgeous in white tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available    1.6432600607208703
man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the    1.5636360329510388
vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club    1.6065767145351917
alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase, it was the most    1.5636360329510388
unheard-of thing ever heard of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception    1.67495327387791
swore that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"?    1.5636360329510388
And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike".    1.4513752902486308
"Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave him. His English    1.5636360329510388
was usable and he used it fearlessly. Toasting in champagne one    1.6065767145351917
night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and    1.67495327387791
gaily cried: "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that    1.6065767145351917
coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation    1.6065767145351917
of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts    1.5127085093302464
complained that the Capitol was out of its wits. Newspaper punditry    1.6065767145351917
was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to    1.6432600607208703
smile.   The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians    1.5636360329510388
usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable    1.3761581156320553
because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin'    1.5127085093302464
Mike" dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional    1.6065767145351917
story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.   1.6432600607208703
The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and the most    1.5636360329510388
inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians. When King Saud    1.6065767145351917
visited Washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press    1.4513752902486308
was the size of his family. Rumor had it that his children numbered    1.67495327387791
in the hundreds. The State Department was little help on this, or    1.6432600607208703
on much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted a Middle    1.6432600607208703
East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until    1.5636360329510388
the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a    1.6065767145351917
brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This    1.4513752902486308
is where I get my information from", he confided. "But bring it    1.6432600607208703
right back. It's the only copy I've got".   The size of    1.6065767145351917
Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his    1.6432600607208703
first meeting with Eisenhower. When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert    1.6432600607208703
robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview.    1.5636360329510388
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American    1.5636360329510388
friendship to bore in on the central question. How many    1.5636360329510388
children did the King have?   "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.   1.5127085093302464
And how many of these were sons?   "Twenty-five",    1.4513752902486308
the sheik replied.   "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter    1.6065767145351917
asked, "that the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom    1.5636360329510388
are sons"?   The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is    1.5127085093302464
precisely correct".   The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness    1.4513752902486308
of language. When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East    1.5636360329510388
peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon found himself    1.6065767145351917
speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo, a language as anarchic    1.5636360329510388
as Casey Stengel's. The reports of President Nasser's pledges    1.5127085093302464
which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became    1.5127085093302464
increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli    1.4513752902486308
Foreign Minister, Mrs& Golda Meir. Finally he reported that    1.5127085093302464
Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli    1.6432600607208703
concessions.    1.0
The deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the    1.7269387314284994
washing is done outside. I know now why our Japanese friends were    1.6432600607208703
surprised when they walked into our bathroom.   Of course, most    1.5636360329510388
toilets are Eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are    1.6432600607208703
raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets- inside.    1.5636360329510388
A few newer homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running    1.6432600607208703
water, they are usually Eastern style.   The next day I visited    1.6065767145351917
International Christian College which has developed since the war    1.5127085093302464
under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan    1.6432600607208703
well. They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching    1.6065767145351917
and learning. The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical    1.6432600607208703
stockroom. Spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need    1.5636360329510388
to be Christian. They have an enviable record of being able to place    1.67495327387791
in employment 100% of their graduates.   In the afternoon Miss    1.5636360329510388
Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs&    1.67495327387791
Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs&    1.6432600607208703
Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful,    1.6065767145351917
artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household-    1.5127085093302464
(four boys and four girls), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle Japanese    1.67495327387791
woman. She was a real experience! The dances were as beautiful    1.6065767145351917
as anything I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes    1.6432600607208703
for scenery and precision as well as imagination.   Because    1.5127085093302464
Don was leaving the next day, I spent the evening with him at Asia    1.7026049541338664
Center. The following morning Mr& Morikawa called for me, and    1.5636360329510388
we went to visit schools- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary    1.4513752902486308
school, and high school- Mr& Yoshimoto's school. There    1.4513752902486308
is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some think    1.67495327387791
too much.   There is a great deal of thought being given to    1.6432600607208703
the question of moral education in the schools. With the loss of the    1.67495327387791
Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God    1.67495327387791
or moral teachings that have strength. The older parents continued    1.5636360329510388
to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people,    1.5636360329510388
who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents. There seems    1.6432600607208703
to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles    1.67495327387791
to give stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and freely,    1.6432600607208703
with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere, especially among    1.6065767145351917
students. Parents indulge their children.   The government    1.3761581156320553
has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education    1.6432600607208703
for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction    1.6065767145351917
and are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese    1.67495327387791
soldiers would not fight again- for why should they? It will be    1.6432600607208703
painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will    1.67495327387791
create or what strong convictions they will develop.   In the evening    1.6065767145351917
the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the    1.6065767145351917
New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good.    1.7026049541338664
They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good,    1.6065767145351917
except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six of the    1.7026049541338664
science teachers were present, and we had great fun.    1.5127085093302464
After    1.0
a day at Nikko, Mrs& Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto.    1.67495327387791
My instructions were that Mr& Nishimo would meet me at the hotel,    1.6432600607208703
but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm    1.7026049541338664
welcome. My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan    1.7026049541338664
Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen,    1.6065767145351917
but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did explain to the students,    1.7269387314284994
however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very    1.67495327387791
small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well. They    1.7269387314284994
understood and teased me a bit about it.   I think I would have    1.67495327387791
been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara,    1.6432600607208703
and Hiroshima. Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its    1.6432600607208703
cultural center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war-    1.6065767145351917
and    1.0
is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan. Here    1.6432600607208703
I was accompanied by Mrs& Okamoto (Fumio's mother), her son,    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Washizu (a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding    1.6065767145351917
for more than a year), and Mr& Nishima, one of the science    1.6432600607208703
teachers. I arrived at 7:00 a&m& and by 9:00 a&m& I had    1.6432600607208703
finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.    1.67495327387791
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens. We visited the    1.6432600607208703
Okamoto home- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony.    1.67495327387791
At 6:00 p&m& we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place    1.67495327387791
where these beautiful dances originated. They were even better than    1.5636360329510388
those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.   After    1.5127085093302464
a supper of <unagi> (rice with eel- eel which is raised in an    1.67495327387791
ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt& Fuji), I returned to my beautiful    1.67495327387791
room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day.    1.7026049541338664
We started at 9 a&m& to visit the Kyoto University where Mr&    1.6432600607208703
Washizu is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities    1.6432600607208703
accompanying the medical school. They apologized for the condition,    1.5127085093302464
including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what    1.7269387314284994
to say. There seemed to be no excuse? I don't have the answer    1.67495327387791
yet.   We had tea at Mr& Washizu's home where I learned    1.6065767145351917
that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His grandfather is    1.6432600607208703
a Buddhist priest; and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest,    1.7026049541338664
but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become    1.7026049541338664
the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for only a few    1.67495327387791
years ago he would have had no choice. In his big home live four families    1.7269387314284994
and thirty people, so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed    1.67495327387791
here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old-    1.6065767145351917
paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc&. He had displayed more of them    1.5636360329510388
than usual so that I could enjoy them. About 100 of the most important    1.7026049541338664
items he had already given to the museum. The house itself is 400    1.67495327387791
years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried times.    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Nishima went with me on the train    1.4513752902486308
to Nara. We passed his house and school on the way. In Nara I    1.7026049541338664
stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their    1.67495327387791
honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid for their coming, but I    1.67495327387791
walked on it, too. Here Mr& Yoneda met us after a three-hour train    1.67495327387791
trip from the town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles    1.67495327387791
in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.   1.67495327387791
In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles    1.7269387314284994
to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima. Again the plan was    1.7026049541338664
for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr& Yoneda    1.7026049541338664
had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr& Nishima    1.7026049541338664
and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night.    1.748515906000203
It is the second largest city in Japan, with about four million people.    1.67495327387791
One spot in Osaka I shall always remember- the bridge where    1.6065767145351917
we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the    1.67495327387791
still waters of the river. In the midst of a great busy city, people    1.7026049541338664
take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.   1.6432600607208703
My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45    1.6065767145351917
a&m&. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little,    1.7269387314284994
after which Mr& Uno would arrive and pilot me around. But there    1.6432600607208703
he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.   1.67495327387791
I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even    1.67495327387791
when I told them I didn't want to. They knew that I was still grieving    1.7269387314284994
over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the    1.67495327387791
recovery    1.0
and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also    1.67495327387791
regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better    1.6065767145351917
a new Japan. There were no words to say this but there was no need.   1.7269387314284994
The teachers of Mr& Uno's school gave me a small gift    1.6065767145351917
to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better city than it was before-    1.7026049541338664
in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace    1.7026049541338664
and understanding. I was grateful for their insight into my need    1.6065767145351917
for this experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima.    1.6432600607208703
On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took    1.6432600607208703
us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University.    1.5127085093302464
This day was "Open House for Parents" day, and the girls were    1.6432600607208703
busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables. Everything was in    1.5636360329510388
an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.   It was    1.5636360329510388
thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese    1.6065767145351917
students in a class in Home Planning. Our Masu is one of the very    1.7026049541338664
few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family    1.6432600607208703
functions and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come when    1.67495327387791
women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now    1.7269387314284994
it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants. Many    1.6432600607208703
of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American    1.67495327387791
homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese    1.6065767145351917
artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the    1.6432600607208703
Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.   At this Women's    1.5127085093302464
University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed    1.6065767145351917
that Japanese women also should be educated. Even today there are    1.6065767145351917
some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this    1.6432600607208703
University continues to grow and to send its students out into the    1.6432600607208703
community. Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus    1.6065767145351917
where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they    1.7269387314284994
can have their social gatherings and professional meetings. As far    1.5636360329510388
as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the    1.67495327387791
creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found    1.7026049541338664
by educated women unafraid to break traditions.   Masu is also    1.5636360329510388
teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo.    1.5636360329510388
Here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled    1.6432600607208703
in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They learn how    1.6065767145351917
to take care of children and sick members of the family. They have model    1.7026049541338664
kitchens, a sick room with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with    1.7026049541338664
a life-like doll. Although the training is only for one month, it    1.6432600607208703
is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's school are much    1.6065767145351917
in demand and can always find work immediately. Occasionally they return    1.6065767145351917
for additional training. Masu's home economics training comes    1.4513752902486308
into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for    1.6065767145351917
the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also uses the training she got    1.6432600607208703
in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners,    1.6432600607208703
and work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education in    1.6065767145351917
the United States, not just in a classroom, but also in an American    1.67495327387791
house with an American housekeeper, stands her in good stead.    1.5636360329510388
After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen    1.5127085093302464
of which Masu had planned, Mr& Washizu and I left to meet representatives    1.67495327387791
of the ~USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo.    1.6065767145351917
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could    1.67495327387791
not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous    1.7026049541338664
in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.    1.6432600607208703
The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only    1.6065767145351917
by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following    1.6432600607208703
consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads    1.4513752902486308
of certain national chain stores should, of course, be applauded. But    1.6065767145351917
for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of    1.748515906000203
a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts    1.6065767145351917
contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions    1.5636360329510388
in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing    1.5636360329510388
a connection between general company practice and local practice    1.5127085093302464
in the South, and by establishing such direct connection between the    1.6065767145351917
practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York    1.6065767145351917
and general company policy. Then the boycott would not be secondary,    1.6065767145351917
but a primary one. It would be directed against the actual location of    1.67495327387791
the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice,    1.67495327387791
must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury    1.6065767145351917
of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy. Perhaps    1.6432600607208703
this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire    1.6432600607208703
national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire    1.6065767145351917
economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores    1.6432600607208703
in the matter of segregation. Such a general boycott might still be a    1.67495327387791
blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable    1.4513752902486308
justification.    1.0
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove    1.5127085093302464
most decisive and is most clearly legitimate. Moreover, prudence alone    1.5636360329510388
would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to    1.6065767145351917
fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon    1.6065767145351917
national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage    1.6065767145351917
to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to    1.6432600607208703
greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even    1.5636360329510388
(as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure    1.6065767145351917
to correct injustice) to its going out of business in certain sections    1.6432600607208703
of the country (as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many    1.67495327387791
meetings in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business    1.6065767145351917
in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover    1.67495327387791
a large number of southern adherents).   In any case, anyone who    1.6065767145351917
fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary    1.5127085093302464
applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified    1.5636360329510388
that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years    1.7026049541338664
ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils    1.5127085093302464
in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer    1.6065767145351917
in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a    1.6065767145351917
national ~TV network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed,    1.6432600607208703
a "high yellow gal" smooching with a white man. It is true,    1.6432600607208703
of course, that the end or objective of this action was different. But    1.67495327387791
since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals    1.67495327387791
and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where    1.6065767145351917
direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the    1.6432600607208703
matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not    1.7026049541338664
effectively present, there has to be a <morality of means> applied in    1.6432600607208703
every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures    1.67495327387791
or other forms of force.   the need that we not give unqualified    1.6432600607208703
approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed    1.6065767145351917
against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the    1.67495327387791
fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation    1.5636360329510388
mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical    1.67495327387791
violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically    1.5127085093302464
opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow    1.5127085093302464
humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously    1.7026049541338664
brutal means. The end or aim of the action, of course, is also    1.67495327387791
important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community    1.6432600607208703
customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person    1.67495327387791
from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e&g&, against    1.5636360329510388
Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the    1.6065767145351917
present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance    1.6432600607208703
to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies. This, however,    1.5636360329510388
is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and    1.6065767145351917
economic conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war of all    1.67495327387791
against all no less than if other means are used. It is also sufficient    1.7026049541338664
to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs    1.67495327387791
to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his <conduct>    1.7269387314284994
is just, i&e&, that, if economic pressure has to be resorted    1.6065767145351917
to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the    1.6065767145351917
way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while,    1.6065767145351917
if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily    1.6432600607208703
(however inevitably) and not by deliberate intent and direct    1.5127085093302464
action against them.   It is clear that non-violent resistance is    1.5636360329510388
a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian    1.6432600607208703
morality, like any other form of resistance. The <language> used    1.5636360329510388
itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle    1.67495327387791
for victory (perhaps to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in    1.67495327387791
leaders has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom    1.6432600607208703
of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in the world today    1.67495327387791
might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom    1.67495327387791
is going to march over them". The present writer certainly agrees    1.6065767145351917
with that statement, and would also affirm this- in the order of justice.    1.67495327387791
However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity    1.6432600607208703
interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches    1.6065767145351917
forward. And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice    1.5127085093302464
and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental    1.6065767145351917
good will. It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained    1.6065767145351917
above, and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent    1.6432600607208703
means.    1.0
R& B& Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will of    1.6065767145351917
the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical    1.7026049541338664
jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance. He    1.6065767145351917
suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent    1.6065767145351917
resistance of most victims would render him"; and again, that    1.5636360329510388
"the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object    1.6065767145351917
of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will,    1.6065767145351917
to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope. In another respect    1.5636360329510388
it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent    1.5127085093302464
only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is    1.7026049541338664
based on sounder values".   A trial of strength, however, is made    1.6065767145351917
quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent    1.6432600607208703
resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder    1.6065767145351917
values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means,    1.6432600607208703
men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause. This makes necessary    1.6432600607208703
a morality of means, and principles governing the <conduct> of    1.5636360329510388
resistance whenever this is thought to be justified. The question,    1.5636360329510388
then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent    1.6065767145351917
means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes    1.7026049541338664
and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing    1.4513752902486308
him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some    1.6432600607208703
causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem    1.67495327387791
insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently.    1.5636360329510388
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into    1.6432600607208703
the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem    1.7269387314284994
the more unlimited aggression.   Among Christian groups, the    1.4513752902486308
Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that    1.6432600607208703
the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the    1.6065767145351917
Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the will and word of God    1.7026049541338664
are for them concentrated in Christlike love, it seems clear to them    1.6432600607208703
that non-violent resistance is quite another thing. "The primary    1.5127085093302464
objective of non-violence", writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist,    1.4513752902486308
"is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain    1.6432600607208703
desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage".    1.5636360329510388
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must    1.5636360329510388
certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any    1.5636360329510388
form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and    1.6432600607208703
affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine    1.5636360329510388
the moral principles limiting resistance. These principles we    1.4513752902486308
have now set forth. <Economy> in the use of power needs not only to    1.7026049541338664
be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is done it will    1.6432600607208703
be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across    1.5636360329510388
the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to    1.5636360329510388
both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action.    1.6065767145351917
Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a    1.6065767145351917
<barely    1.0
intolerable> pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed.    1.5636360329510388
That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly    1.6065767145351917
in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals. There    1.5636360329510388
must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use    1.6065767145351917
of means of resistance, violent or non-violent. The justification    1.5127085093302464
in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays    1.67495327387791
down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against    1.5636360329510388
whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted    1.6432600607208703
also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the    1.67495327387791
sake even of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic    1.6432600607208703
withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading    1.5127085093302464
in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these    1.6065767145351917
distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be    1.5636360329510388
singled out.   We may now take up for consideration a hard case    1.6432600607208703
which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure    1.5636360329510388
or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above.    1.67495327387791
There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken    1.67495327387791
at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination    1.5636360329510388
against a whole people. An excellent article was published recently in    1.6065767145351917
the journal of the Church Peace Union by a South African journalist    1.6432600607208703
on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa,    1.6065767145351917
amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic <complicity> of both    1.5636360329510388
the government and the people of the United States in these conditions.    1.6432600607208703
"**h Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors    1.5636360329510388
but also from the pockets of U& S& taxpayers", this author    1.6065767145351917
states, "are being poured into South Africa to support a system    1.6065767145351917
dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical    1.5636360329510388
exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens    1.6065767145351917
not to be white". Both the conditions and the complicity are documented    1.6432600607208703
in considerable detail. This leads to the conclusion that "the    1.5636360329510388
fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not    1.67495327387791
<apartheid> shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic    1.5127085093302464
boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with    1.67495327387791
the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as    1.67495327387791
a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our    1.67495327387791
own country, but also in accord with our law, U&S& Code Title    1.6432600607208703
19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced    1.6432600607208703
or convict labor. Not only should this provision be enforced but    1.6065767145351917
other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author    1.6065767145351917
believes, "must surely be supported by every American who values the    1.6065767145351917
freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated    1.7026049541338664
by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly    1.67495327387791
contribute to the enslavement of another nation".   1.3761581156320553
NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights    1.5127085093302464
and of integration. They have also led the nation in the direction    1.6432600607208703
of a welfare state. And both in their objectives of non-discrimination    1.6065767145351917
and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners    1.6432600607208703
who are called Bourbons. The name presumably derives from the    1.5636360329510388
French royal house which never learned and never forgot; since Bourbon    1.6065767145351917
whiskey, though of Kentucky origin, is at least as much favored    1.6065767145351917
by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South.   The    1.6432600607208703
nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little    1.6065767145351917
understood in the North. The race problem has tended to obscure other,    1.6432600607208703
less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.    1.5636360329510388
It is these other differences between North and South- other,    1.5636360329510388
that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare-    1.5636360329510388
which I chiefly discuss herein.   I write about Northern liberals    1.5636360329510388
from considerable personal experience. A Southerner married to    1.4513752902486308
a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting    1.67495327387791
town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men,    1.5636360329510388
and business executives of egghead tastes. Most of them are Democrats    1.6065767145351917
and nearly all consider themselves, and are viewed as, liberals. This    1.6065767145351917
is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of    1.6065767145351917
liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center    1.6065767145351917
are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that    1.6065767145351917
the best government was the least government. Yet paradoxically my    1.5636360329510388
liberal    1.0
friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints.    1.6065767145351917
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and    1.7026049541338664
democracy, I find that they fall into two categories: the simpler    1.6065767145351917
ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without    1.6065767145351917
analysis; and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that    1.5636360329510388
these things don't count any more in the world of to-day. I am naive,    1.7026049541338664
they say, to make use of such words.   I take this to mean    1.67495327387791
that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical?- liberal    1.4513752902486308
considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will    1.6432600607208703
assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual    1.6065767145351917
and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield    1.6432600607208703
before it. This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian    1.6432600607208703
bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try    1.6065767145351917
to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court. As for states'    1.6065767145351917
rights, they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends    1.6432600607208703
except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist    1.6065767145351917
now only as anachronisms.   The American liberal may, in the world    1.6065767145351917
of to-day, have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed    1.67495327387791
in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one. Why, in the first place,    1.7026049541338664
call himself a liberal if he is against <laissez-faire> and favors    1.6065767145351917
an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over    1.4513752902486308
everybody? If he attaches little importance to personal liberty,    1.5127085093302464
why not make this known to the world? And if he is so scornful of    1.7269387314284994
the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution    1.6432600607208703
that he could more sincerely support?   I am concerned here,    1.5636360329510388
however, with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South. It    1.5636360329510388
appears to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort    1.6432600607208703
to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends. His assumption    1.6065767145351917
seems to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more    1.67495327387791
liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy    1.6065767145351917
with his views. <Time's> editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book,    1.5636360329510388
<The Waist-High Culture>, wrote: "**h most of what was    1.5127085093302464
different about it (the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to    1.6065767145351917
**h". This, for the liberals I know, would be an understatement.    1.6065767145351917
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate    1.67495327387791
hatred that was directed against Fascism.   I do not think    1.5636360329510388
that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the    1.6065767145351917
North. In business circles, usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere    1.5636360329510388
would hardly be found. But in our case- and neither my wife nor    1.67495327387791
I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional    1.6432600607208703
outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and    1.6065767145351917
come close to wrecking several more. In fact it has caused us to give    1.7026049541338664
serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy    1.6432600607208703
for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host    1.6432600607208703
is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners    1.7026049541338664
who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards    1.6432600607208703
down.   Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in    1.5127085093302464
the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state-supported    1.5127085093302464
universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority    1.5636360329510388
view. But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected    1.6432600607208703
to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in    1.4513752902486308
social gatherings. From my wife's experience and other sources, this    1.5636360329510388
seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles. The strong feeling    1.6065767145351917
is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among    1.6065767145351917
college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who    1.5127085093302464
studied in the North. And social relations arising out of business    1.6065767145351917
ties impose courtesy, if not sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners.    1.6065767145351917
Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the    1.5636360329510388
prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.   There    1.4513752902486308
are of course many Souths; but for this discussion the most important    1.6432600607208703
division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who    1.6065767145351917
haven't. My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed    1.6432600607208703
rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War. Nobody    1.67495327387791
knows how many Southerners there are in this category. I suspect    1.6065767145351917
that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to    1.6432600607208703
believe. I never heard of a poll being taken on the question. No doubt    1.7026049541338664
such a thing would be considered unpatriotic. Prior to 1954 I imagine    1.6432600607208703
that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy.    1.6065767145351917
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is    1.5636360329510388
more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following    1.6065767145351917
the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would    1.6432600607208703
have been for the Old South.   Belief in the traditional way of    1.6432600607208703
life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones. Probably    1.7026049541338664
a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain    1.5127085093302464
unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia, North Carolina, and    1.4513752902486308
Alabama following along after them. Old attitudes are held more tenaciously    1.6065767145351917
in the Tidewater than the Piedmont; so that a line running    1.6065767145351917
down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater    1.6432600607208703
would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course,    1.67495327387791
important minority enclaves.   The long-settled areas of states    1.4513752902486308
like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture    1.5127085093302464
to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and    1.6432600607208703
the consciousness of loss the greater. Also, we should not even to-day    1.6432600607208703
discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering    1.6432600607208703
on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies    1.6065767145351917
than with the North even after independence. The social and psychological    1.6065767145351917
consequences of this continue to affect the area. In certain    1.5636360329510388
respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South.    1.5636360329510388
Poor where they had once been rich, humbled where they had been    1.6432600607208703
arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the    1.67495327387791
nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from    1.6432600607208703
the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country. And    1.6432600607208703
no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia, which    1.6432600607208703
were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century, bitterly    1.6432600607208703
regretted the revolt against the Crown.   Among Bourbons    1.4513752902486308
the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed    1.6432600607208703
than other factors. All Southerners agree that slavery had to    1.5636360329510388
go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling    1.5636360329510388
it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did. Southern    1.67495327387791
resentment has been over the method of its ending, the invasion,    1.6065767145351917
and Reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro    1.5636360329510388
political control in many counties. But apart from racial problems,    1.5636360329510388
the old unreconstructed South- to use the moderate words favored by    1.6065767145351917
Mr& Thomas Griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what    1.5636360329510388
is different about the civilization of the North. And this, in effect,    1.6432600607208703
means most of modern America.   It is hard to see how the    1.6432600607208703
situation could be otherwise. And therein, I feel, many Northerners    1.5636360329510388
delude themselves about the South. For one thing, this is not a subject    1.67495327387791
often discussed or analyzed. There seems to be almost a conspiracy    1.6065767145351917
of silence veiling it. I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful    1.67495327387791
thinking: don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and    1.5636360329510388
they will take care of themselves. Or else the North really believes    1.6432600607208703
that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come    1.6065767145351917
around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers    1.7026049541338664
of the American Dream, like everybody else.   If the circumstances    1.5636360329510388
are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be    1.6432600607208703
true. The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western    1.7026049541338664
world. Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area    1.6065767145351917
appropriate to a pre-World-War-/1, great power have been, following    1.5127085093302464
conquest,    1.0
ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had    1.6065767145351917
imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike. And the    1.6065767145351917
great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent.    1.6065767145351917
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic    1.67495327387791
origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign    1.6065767145351917
domination. The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot    1.6065767145351917
and cold. In every war of the United States since the Civil War    1.67495327387791
the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country. So instead    1.67495327387791
of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the    1.6065767145351917
two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances    1.67495327387791
and cement reunion. And there is no section of the nation more    1.6432600607208703
ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism. Had the    1.6432600607208703
situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in    1.6065767145351917
1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is    1.6432600607208703
little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put    1.6065767145351917
on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain. It    1.6432600607208703
is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners    1.6065767145351917
should have been as docile as they have. The North should thank its    1.67495327387791
stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not    1.7269387314284994
draw false inferences therefrom.   The two main charges levelled    1.5127085093302464
against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social    1.6432600607208703
reactionaries. There is much truth in both these charges, and not    1.6065767145351917
many Bourbons deny them. Whatever their faults, they are not hypocrites.    1.6065767145351917
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best    1.6065767145351917
race in the world and that it should remain pure. Many Northeners    1.6432600607208703
believe this, too, but few of them will say so publicly. The Bourbon    1.67495327387791
economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern    1.6065767145351917
conservatives. But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed    1.5127085093302464
go much further than this. They believe that if the South    1.6065767145351917
had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that    1.67495327387791
of modern America. As it is, they consider that the North is now    1.67495327387791
reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high    1.6432600607208703
standard of living the "American way" has been proved inferior    1.5636360329510388
to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the    1.6065767145351917
socialistic features of the latter.   The South's antipathy    1.4513752902486308
to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh    1.5636360329510388
accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy    1.6065767145351917
and the use of leisure. Their own easier, slower tempo is especially    1.6432600607208703
dear to Southerners; and I have heard many say that they are content    1.67495327387791
to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because    1.7269387314284994
they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.   1.6065767145351917
In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry Maine noted    1.67495327387791
long ago, were only two in number: internal order and external security.    1.6432600607208703
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men,    1.5636360329510388
the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order    1.5636360329510388
within its territorial borders. Outside those limits it asserted, as    1.5636360329510388
against other states, a position of sovereign equality, and, as against    1.6065767145351917
the "inferior" peoples of the non-Western world, a position of    1.5636360329510388
dominance. It became the sole "subject" of "international law"    1.5127085093302464
(a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham),    1.6432600607208703
a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western    1.7269387314284994
nations could do in the world arena. (That corpus of law was a    1.67495327387791
reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and    1.6065767145351917
nineteenth centuries. Speaking generally, it furthered- and still    1.4513752902486308
tends to further- the interests of the Western powers. The enormous    1.6065767145351917
changes in world politics have, however, thrown it into confusion, so    1.6065767145351917
much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in    1.7269387314284994
need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions    1.6065767145351917
of the present era.)   Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned    1.5636360329510388
above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state    1.7026049541338664
responsibility, either internally or externally. This was particularly    1.4513752902486308
true in the world arena, which was an anarchical battleground characterized    1.6065767145351917
by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires.    1.4513752902486308
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have    1.7269387314284994
astonished a nineteenth-century statesman. His duty was to his sovereign    1.5636360329510388
and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial    1.6432600607208703
boundaries was not to be contemplated. Thus, to cite but one    1.6065767145351917
example, the <Pax Britannica> of the nineteenth century, whether with    1.5636360329510388
the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling    1.67495327387791
world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other    1.5636360329510388
nations (e&g&, the United States) may have incidentally benefited.    1.5127085093302464
At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal    1.6065767145351917
responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial    1.6065767145351917
state was strongly resisted. Social Darwinism was able to stave    1.5636360329510388
off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.   1.6065767145351917
However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are multiple    1.5127085093302464
reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has    1.5127085093302464
occurred in both facets of national activity. A concept of responsibility    1.6065767145351917
is in process of articulation and establishment. Already firmly    1.5127085093302464
implanted internally, it is a growing factor in external matters.    1.5636360329510388
A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned    1.6065767145351917
an important corner. In what has aptly been called a "constitutional    1.6065767145351917
revolution", the basic nature of government was transformed from    1.5127085093302464
one essentially negative in nature (the "night-watchman state") to    1.5127085093302464
one with affirmative duties to perform. The "positive state" came    1.5636360329510388
into existence. For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences,    1.5127085093302464
there has been a special fascination since then in the role    1.6065767145351917
played by the Supreme Court in that transformation- the manner in    1.6065767145351917
which its decisions altered in "the switch in time that saved nine",    1.6432600607208703
President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious "Court-packing    1.4513752902486308
plan", the imprimatur of judicial approval that was    1.4513752902486308
finally placed upon social legislation. Of greater importance, however,    1.5127085093302464
is the content of those programs, which have had and are having enormous    1.67495327387791
consequences for the American people. Labor relations have been    1.5127085093302464
transformed, income security has become a standardized feature of political    1.5636360329510388
platforms, and all the many facets of the American version of    1.6065767145351917
the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom. A national    1.6432600607208703
consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts    1.5127085093302464
are desirable as well as necessary. Ratified in the Republican Party    1.6065767145351917
victory in 1952, the Positive State is now evidenced by political    1.6065767145351917
campaigns being waged not on <whether> but on <how much> social    1.6065767145351917
legislation there should be.   The general acceptance of the idea    1.5636360329510388
of governmental (i&e&, societal) responsibility for the economic    1.4513752902486308
well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant    1.67495327387791
watersheds in American constitutional history. The other, of    1.4513752902486308
course, was the Civil War, the conflict which a century ago insured    1.6432600607208703
national unity over fragmentation. A third, one of at least equal and    1.6432600607208703
perhaps even greater importance, is now being traversed: American    1.5127085093302464
immersion and involvement in world affairs.   Internal national    1.4513752902486308
responsibility, now a truism, need not be documented. Nevertheless,    1.5127085093302464
it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for, as    1.67495327387791
will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept. Thirty    1.7026049541338664
years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression,    1.5636360329510388
the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow    1.6065767145351917
"natural forces" to operate and cure the distress. That guiding    1.5636360329510388
principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the    1.6432600607208703
New Deal; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the    1.6432600607208703
Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the    1.6065767145351917
responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.    1.5636360329510388
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through    1.5127085093302464
planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution. In    1.5127085093302464
1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration    1.5636360329510388
came when the principle of <national> responsibility for <local>    1.5127085093302464
economic distress won out over a "state's-responsibility"    1.3761581156320553
proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief    1.5127085093302464
by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted    1.67495327387791
with manpower surplus. The American people have indeed come    1.5127085093302464
a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.   Internal    1.6432600607208703
national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the    1.6065767145351917
Industrial Revolution. Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption    1.6065767145351917
of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals    1.6065767145351917
to cope with the rigors of the era. National responsibility for    1.6065767145351917
individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or    1.6432600607208703
even to the Western nations. A measure of its widespread acceptance    1.6065767145351917
may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists    1.6432600607208703
in 1959. Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International    1.6432600607208703
Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world,    1.6065767145351917
the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law    1.5636360329510388
to include affirmative governmental duties. It is noteworthy that    1.5127085093302464
the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed,    1.67495327387791
former colonial nations. The Rule of Law, historically a principle    1.5636360329510388
according everyone his "day in court" before an impartial tribunal,    1.5636360329510388
was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of    1.5127085093302464
government to promote individual welfare. Recognizing that the Rule    1.5127085093302464
of Law is "a dynamic concept **h which should be employed not only    1.67495327387791
to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free    1.67495327387791
society", the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility    1.5636360329510388
"to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions    1.4513752902486308
under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized".    1.5636360329510388
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common    1.5636360329510388
feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world. For better or for worse,    1.67495327387791
we all now live in welfare states, the organizing principle of which    1.6432600607208703
is collective responsibility for individual well-being.   Whether    1.3761581156320553
a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility    1.5127085093302464
operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more    1.6065767145351917
difficult to establish. The hypothesis ventured here is that it does,    1.6065767145351917
and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition. The content    1.5636360329510388
is not the same, however: rather than individual security, it    1.5636360329510388
is the security and continuing existence of an "ideological group"-    1.5636360329510388
those in the "free world"- that is basic. External national    1.5636360329510388
responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of    1.5127085093302464
the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability    1.6432600607208703
of other friendly nations. If internal responsibility suggests acceptance    1.5127085093302464
of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility    1.5127085093302464
implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.   1.3761581156320553
Reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty-    1.4513752902486308
may help to reveal the contours of the new principle. In its beginnings    1.67495327387791
the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally,    1.5127085093302464
against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence    1.5636360329510388
of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church. The breakup of    1.6432600607208703
the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more    1.6432600607208703
than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism. (Since the time-span    1.6432600607208703
of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence    1.5127085093302464
of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural    1.6432600607208703
for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest    1.6432600607208703
form of order, something permanent and unchanging.) The concept of    1.5636360329510388
nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies    1.5127085093302464
the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure. But    1.6065767145351917
it is more than that. For it includes the emotional ties that bind    1.67495327387791
men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large    1.6432600607208703
group of people together as a unit. Today, as new nations rise from    1.67495327387791
the former colonial empires, nationalism is one of the hurricane forces    1.6065767145351917
loose in the world. Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has    1.6065767145351917
become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that    1.5636360329510388
nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm. Historically, however,    1.4513752902486308
the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the    1.7269387314284994
Western civilizational group. By subduing disparate lesser groups    1.4513752902486308
the nation has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual    1.67495327387791
liberty. Within their confines, moreover, technological and    1.3761581156320553
industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing    1.5636360329510388
the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied. While the    1.6065767145351917
pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism    1.5636360329510388
has in fact served the Western peoples well. (Whether historical nationalism    1.6065767145351917
helped the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether    1.6065767145351917
today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial    1.5636360329510388
aspects, are other questions.)   It is one of the ironic quirks    1.6065767145351917
of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the    1.6065767145351917
territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that    1.5636360329510388
the nation-state attained its highest number (approximately 100). But    1.5127085093302464
it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is    1.67495327387791
no longer a tenable concept is <because> it has spread throughout the    1.6432600607208703
planet. In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had    1.6065767145351917
limited application, both as to geography and as to population; it    1.6065767145351917
becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.   1.5636360329510388
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal    1.5127085093302464
principle of sovereignty. The former receives its legitimacy from the    1.5636360329510388
latter. Operating side by side, together they helped shore up the nation-state.    1.6432600607208703
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present    1.5127085093302464
usage it is essentially modern. Jean Bodin, writing in the sixteenth    1.6065767145351917
century, may have been the seminal thinker, but it was the vastly influential    1.67495327387791
John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now    1.67495327387791
understood. Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty    1.4513752902486308
still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking. To    1.5636360329510388
him, law is the command of the sovereign (the English monarch) who    1.6432600607208703
personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to    1.6432600607208703
make law- i&e&, to prevail over internal groups and to be free    1.6432600607208703
from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations. These fundamental    1.6065767145351917
ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual (internal-external)    1.5127085093302464
aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate    1.5636360329510388
political power.   The nation-state, then, exemplifies the principle    1.4513752902486308
of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over    1.4513752902486308
domestic affairs and independence from outside control. In fact, however,    1.5636360329510388
both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined. High-level    1.5636360329510388
abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision.    1.5127085093302464
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic    1.6432600607208703
societies, in which "popular" sovereignty is said to exist,    1.5127085093302464
and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split. Nevertheless,    1.67495327387791
nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted    1.4513752902486308
wisdom, to describe the modern world. Is there a different reality behind    1.6432600607208703
the facade? Does the surface hide a quite different picture?   1.5636360329510388
The short answer to those questions is "yes". Both concepts    1.5636360329510388
are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted    1.5636360329510388
by a concept of national responsibility. As evidence to support    1.5636360329510388
that view, consider the following illustrative instances.    1.3761581156320553
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident? What steps have been    1.6432600607208703
taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the    1.67495327387791
destruction of continents? Are we as safe as we should be from such    1.67495327387791
a disaster? Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety?    1.6432600607208703
Will the danger increase or decrease?   I have just asked    1.5636360329510388
these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of    1.6432600607208703
key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl    1.6065767145351917
for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain    1.6432600607208703
Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as "Sherwood    1.5127085093302464
Forest". I asked the same questions inside the launch-control    1.5127085093302464
rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear    1.6432600607208703
sidearms are manning the "commit buttons" that could start a war-    1.6065767145351917
accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other    1.6065767145351917
pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.   To    1.5636360329510388
the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments    1.5127085093302464
and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of    1.6065767145351917
tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched.    1.4513752902486308
There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate.    1.5127085093302464
"Readiness exercises" are almost continuous. Each could be the real    1.5636360329510388
thing.   In the command centers there are special clocks ready    1.5636360329510388
to tick off the minutes elapsed since "~E hour". "~E"    1.5636360329510388
stands for "execution"- the moment a "go order" would unleash    1.5636360329510388
an American nuclear strike. There is little time for the men in the    1.67495327387791
command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.    1.5636360329510388
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing    1.5636360329510388
colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business    1.6432600607208703
machines. They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical    1.5127085093302464
details. Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people    1.67495327387791
who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so    1.6432600607208703
they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.   Among    1.5636360329510388
the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others    1.4513752902486308
charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their    1.6065767145351917
"hardware", the answers to my questions varied partly according to    1.5636360329510388
a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call "scenarios".    1.6432600607208703
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it: "You can't have    1.5636360329510388
dry runs on this one". The experts are thus forced to hypothesize    1.6432600607208703
sequences of events that have never occurred, probably never will-    1.5636360329510388
but possibly might. Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with    1.6065767145351917
these men: The more highly placed they are- that is, the more they    1.67495327387791
know- the more concerned they have become.   Already accidental    1.5127085093302464
war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration    1.6432600607208703
about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions    1.5636360329510388
of national security. Only recently new "holes" were    1.4513752902486308
discovered in our safety measures, and a search is now on for more. Work    1.7026049541338664
is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed    1.6432600607208703
on all nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, the experts speak of    1.5127085093302464
wars triggered by "false pre-emption", "escalation", "unauthorized    1.3761581156320553
behavior" and other terms that will be discussed in this report.    1.6065767145351917
They inhabit a secret world centered on "go codes" and "gold    1.6065767145351917
phones". Their conversations were, almost invariably, accompanied    1.3761581156320553
by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward    1.5636360329510388
each other in arclike semicircular motions. One arm represented our bombers    1.6065767145351917
and missiles, the other arm "theirs". Yet implicit in each    1.5636360329510388
movement was the death of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, perhaps    1.6065767145351917
you and me- and the experts.   These men are not callous.    1.6065767145351917
It is their job to think about the unthinkable. Unanimously they believe    1.6432600607208703
that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more    1.7026049541338664
Russians and Communist Chinese, too- thought about accidental    1.4513752902486308
war.   The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box    1.5127085093302464
within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle, a    1.6432600607208703
frail, meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist. He was, and is, with the    1.5636360329510388
~RAND Corporation, a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the    1.5636360329510388
U& S& Air Force. His investigations made him the Paul Revere    1.6065767145351917
of accidental war, and safety procedures were enormously increased.   1.5127085093302464
In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal    1.6432600607208703
by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy    1.4513752902486308
has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war    1.6432600607208703
danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.   The    1.5636360329510388
chain starts at ~BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning    1.4513752902486308
System) in Thule, Greenland. Its radar screens would register Soviet    1.5636360329510388
missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States.    1.5636360329510388
~BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to ~NORAD    1.3761581156320553
(North American Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs,    1.4513752902486308
Colorado, for interpretation; to the ~SAC command and control    1.5127085093302464
post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near    1.6432600607208703
Omaha, Nebraska; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs    1.6065767145351917
of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.   Telephones,    1.5636360329510388
Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems and, in some cases, television,    1.6065767145351917
link all vital points. Alternate locations exist for all key command    1.6065767145351917
centers. For last-ditch emergencies ~SAC has alternate command    1.4513752902486308
posts on ~KC-135 jet tankers. Multiple circuits, routings and    1.5127085093302464
frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.   The    1.5127085093302464
same principle of "redundancy" applies to all communications on these    1.5636360329510388
special networks. And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits    1.6065767145351917
until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special    1.5127085093302464
codes,    1.0
that the messages actually come from their purported sources. Additional    1.5636360329510388
codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.   1.5636360329510388
Only the President is permitted to authorize the    1.4513752902486308
use of nuclear weapons. That's the law. But what if somebody decides    1.6432600607208703
to break it? The President cannot personally remove the safety    1.5636360329510388
devices from every nuclear trigger. He makes the momentous decision.    1.5636360329510388
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers    1.67495327387791
and to push the buttons. What if one or more of them turn irrational    1.7026049541338664
or suddenly, coolly, decide to clobber the Russians? What if the President    1.6432600607208703
himself, in the language of the military, "goes ape"?    1.5127085093302464
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets    1.6065767145351917
without provocation?   Nobody can be absolutely certain of    1.4513752902486308
the answers. However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully,    1.5636360329510388
so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.   Even    1.6065767145351917
the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a "go" order.    1.6432600607208703
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the    1.67495327387791
"go code". In an emergency he would receive available intelligence    1.5636360329510388
on the "gold-phone circuit". A system of "gold"- actually    1.5127085093302464
yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of    1.6065767145351917
the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the ~SAC    1.6065767145351917
commander and other key men. All can be connected with the gold circuit    1.67495327387791
from their homes. All could help the President make his decision.    1.6065767145351917
The talk would not be in code, but neither would it ramble. Vital    1.67495327387791
questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.    1.5636360329510388
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured    1.5127085093302464
me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the    1.6432600607208703
gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from ~BMEWS.   1.5636360329510388
If communications work, his decision would be instantly known    1.5127085093302464
in all command posts that would originate the actual go order. For    1.6432600607208703
these centers, too, are on the gold circuit. They include the Navy's    1.6432600607208703
Atlantic Command at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with    1.5636360329510388
the Polaris subs; ~NATO headquarters in Europe; Air Force    1.5127085093302464
forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific, which control    1.5636360329510388
tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and ~SAC, which controls    1.6065767145351917
long-range bombers and Atlas missiles.   Let us look in on    1.5636360329510388
one of these nerve centers- ~SAC at Omaha- and see what must    1.6432600607208703
still happen before a wing of ~B-52 bombers could drop their ~H-bombs.   1.6432600607208703
In a word, plenty. The key man almost certainly would    1.5636360329510388
be Col& William W& Wisman, ~SAC's senior controller. He    1.5127085093302464
or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, all full colonels,    1.6432600607208703
mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day. It is a quiet    1.7269387314284994
but impressive room- 140 feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, twenty-one    1.5636360329510388
feet high. Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts    1.5127085093302464
are crammed with intelligence information. And Bill Wisman, forty-three,    1.5127085093302464
a farmer's son from Beallsville, Ohio, is a quiet but impressive    1.6065767145351917
man. His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown. His movements    1.6432600607208703
and speech are precise, clear and quick. No question ruffles him    1.6065767145351917
or causes him to hesitate.   Wisman, who has had the chief controller's    1.6432600607208703
job for four years, calls the signals for a team operating    1.6065767145351917
three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights, switches and buttons.    1.6065767145351917
At least a dozen men, some armed, are never far away from him.    1.67495327387791
In front of him is a gold phone. In emergencies the ~SAC commander,    1.67495327387791
Gen& Thomas Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy    1.6065767145351917
a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman    1.6432600607208703
and his staff. At General Power's seat in the balcony there is    1.6432600607208703
also a gold phone. General Power would participate in the decision    1.6065767145351917
making. Wisman, below, would listen in and act. His consoles can give    1.6432600607208703
him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and    1.6432600607208703
with every ~SAC aircraft.   He need only pick up one of    1.6065767145351917
the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the    1.67495327387791
big red button marked ALERT. (There are two receivers in case    1.6065767145351917
one should be dropped and damaged.)   But Wisman, too, does not    1.6065767145351917
know the go code. He must take it from "the red box". In point    1.7026049541338664
of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half    1.7677783654484436
feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to    1.7026049541338664
Wisman's right. The box is internally wired so the door can never    1.6432600607208703
be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ("It's real obnoxious").   1.6065767145351917
Now we must become vague, for we are approaching    1.5127085093302464
one of the nation's most guarded secrets. The codes in the red box-    1.67495327387791
there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained    1.5636360329510388
in a sealed ~X-ray-proof "unique device". They are supplied,    1.5127085093302464
a batch at a time, by a secret source and are continually changed    1.67495327387791
by Wisman or his staff, at random intervals.   But even the contents    1.6432600607208703
of Wisman's box cannot start a war. They are mere fragments,    1.6065767145351917
just one portion of preprepared messages. What these fragments are    1.5636360329510388
and how they activate the go order may not be revealed. The pieces must    1.7026049541338664
be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff.    1.6432600607208703
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures    1.4513752902486308
which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special    1.67495327387791
codes, each message also contains an "internal authenticator",    1.4513752902486308
another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting    1.6065767145351917
the real thing.   I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke    1.6432600607208703
out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one. "I'd wind    1.6432600607208703
up full of .38 bullet holes", he said, and there was no question that    1.7026049541338664
he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.   Now let    1.6065767145351917
us imagine a wing of ~B-52's, on alert near their "positive control    1.6432600607208703
(or fail-safe) points", the spots on the map, many miles from    1.6065767145351917
Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific    1.6065767145351917
orders to proceed to their targets. They, too, have fragments of    1.6065767145351917
the go code with them. As Wisman put it, "They have separate pieces    1.67495327387791
of the pie, and we have the whole pie. Once we send out the whole    1.7269387314284994
pie, they can put their pieces into it. Unless we send out the whole    1.7026049541338664
pie, their pieces mean nothing". Why does Wisman's ever-changing    1.5127085093302464
code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers?    1.6432600607208703
The answer is a cryptographic secret. At any rate, three    1.5636360329510388
men out of a six-man ~B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's    1.67495327387791
go-to-war message. Each must match Wisman's "pie" with the    1.5127085093302464
fragment that he carries with him. All three must compare notes and agree    1.67495327387791
After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated    1.4513752902486308
work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum    1.5636360329510388
of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each    1.6432600607208703
with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released.    1.7026049541338664
Unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals    1.6065767145351917
from the handles removed first- no damage can be done.   1.5636360329510388
Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the game ended. They    1.5636360329510388
went as rigid as black statuary **h six figures, lean and tall and    1.67495327387791
angular, went still. Their heads were in the air sniffing. They all    1.6432600607208703
swung at the same instant in the same direction. They saw it before    1.67495327387791
I did, even with my binoculars. It was nothing more than a tiny distant    1.7026049541338664
rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds    1.67495327387791
to the earth. In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree,    1.7026049541338664
no more. A white man would not have seen it. The aborigines fastened    1.67495327387791
upon it with a concentration beyond pathos. Watching, they waited    1.5636360329510388
until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant    1.67495327387791
across the dry burning land. At once the whole band set off at a lope.    1.7269387314284994
They were chasing a rain cloud.   They went after the squall    1.6065767145351917
as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow. I followed them    1.67495327387791
in the jeep and now they did not care. The games were over, this    1.7026049541338664
was life. Occasionally, for no reason that I could see, they would suddenly    1.67495327387791
alter the angle of their trot. Sometimes I guessed it was because    1.6432600607208703
the rain squall had changed direction. Sometimes it was to skirt    1.6065767145351917
a gulley. Their gait is impossible to convey in words. It has nothing    1.67495327387791
of the proud stride of the trained runner about it, it is not a lope,    1.7269387314284994
it is not done with style or verve. It is the gait of the human who    1.748515906000203
must run to live: arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground,    1.6432600607208703
head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target,    1.6432600607208703
a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully    1.67495327387791
graceful. It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.   1.5636360329510388
They ran for three hours. Finally, avoiding hummocks and seeking low    1.6065767145351917
ground, they intercepted the rain squall. For ten minutes they ran    1.6065767145351917
beneath the squall, raising their arms and, for the first time, shouting    1.6432600607208703
and capering. Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.    1.6432600607208703
They were studying the ground. Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a    1.6432600607208703
few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground. He had found    1.7026049541338664
a depression with rain water in it. He bent down, a black cranelike figure,    1.7026049541338664
and put his mouth to the ground.   With a lordly and generous    1.6432600607208703
gesture,    1.0
the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows. The    1.67495327387791
other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle. In an instant    1.6432600607208703
he had sucked it dry.   The aborigine lives on the cruelest land    1.6432600607208703
I have ever seen. Which does not mean that it is ugly. Part of it    1.7269387314284994
is, of course. There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which    1.67495327387791
are hideous. They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so    1.7026049541338664
many centuries that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges    1.67495327387791
fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty    1.6432600607208703
feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand.    1.7026049541338664
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality. But much of the land    1.6432600607208703
which the aborigine wanders <looks> as if it should be hospitable.    1.6065767145351917
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has a peaceful quality,    1.67495327387791
the hills roll softly.   The malignancy of such a landscape    1.5636360329510388
has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean. He    1.5636360329510388
tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock,    1.7026049541338664
a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer. They went well-equipped    1.6065767145351917
with everything except knowledge of the "outback" country. "   1.4513752902486308
The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle    1.5636360329510388
slopes and soft gray tree-clumps. Nothing appalling or horrible rushed    1.5636360329510388
upon these men. Only there happened- nothing. There might have    1.5636360329510388
been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only-    1.6432600607208703
there was not. It might have rained, any time; only- it did not.    1.67495327387791
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise;    1.7026049541338664
only- there was not. They lay, with the birds hopping from branch    1.6432600607208703
to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them. No one    1.7026049541338664
came".   The white men died. And countless others like them have    1.6065767145351917
died. Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of    1.6065767145351917
men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly    1.6432600607208703
lost direction, were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant    1.6432600607208703
and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally died.   1.5636360329510388
The aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard    1.6432600607208703
and pitiless. He knows that the economy of life in the "outback"    1.6432600607208703
is awful. There is no room for error or waste. Any organism that falters    1.7026049541338664
or misperceives the signals or weakens is done. I do not know    1.6432600607208703
if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge, but    1.7026049541338664
I suspect that it can. Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his    1.67495327387791
odd air of dignity.    1.0
SEEING an aborigine    1.0
today is a difficult thing. Many of them have drifted into the    1.6432600607208703
cities and towns and seaports. Others are confined to vast reservations,    1.6065767145351917
and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish    1.5636360329510388
them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they    1.7026049541338664
are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for <corroborees>    1.5636360329510388
at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch-    1.5636360329510388
which is very low indeed.   I persuaded an Australian friend    1.5636360329510388
who had lived "outback" for years to take me to see some aborigines    1.67495327387791
living in the bush. It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation,    1.67495327387791
even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge    1.6432600607208703
of the aborigines and their language. Finally, however, the arrangements    1.5636360329510388
were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover. We    1.7026049541338664
followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a    1.7026049541338664
smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth.    1.67495327387791
The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big    1.7269387314284994
red boulder, swung off the road. At once he started to glance toward    1.67495327387791
the instrument panel. It took me a moment to realize what was odd    1.67495327387791
about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked    1.67495327387791
gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about. The rancher    1.6432600607208703
was navigating his way across the flatland.   "Do you always    1.5636360329510388
navigate like this"? I asked.   "Damned right", he    1.4513752902486308
said. "Once I get out on the flat I do. Some chaps that know an    1.7269387314284994
area well can make their way by landmarks **h a tree here, a wash here,    1.7269387314284994
a boulder there. But if you don't know the place like the palm of    1.7026049541338664
your hand, you'd better use a compass and the speedometer. Two miles    1.6432600607208703
northeast, then five miles southwest **h that sort of thing. Very    1.6065767145351917
simple".   He was right. The landscape kept repeating itself.    1.5127085093302464
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was    1.7026049541338664
hopeless. Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines. They    1.5636360329510388
were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man, his lubra,    1.6065767145351917
and two children. The sun was not yet high and all of them were in    1.7269387314284994
the small area    1.0
of shade cast by the boulder.   There was also a dog,    1.6065767145351917
a dingo dog. Its ribs showed, it was a yellow nondescript color,    1.6432600607208703
it suffered from a variety of sores, hair had scabbed off its body in    1.7026049541338664
patches. It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving,    1.7026049541338664
watching us carefully. It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished    1.67495327387791
dog. No one patted the dog. It was not a pet. It was a worker.   1.7269387314284994
"The buggers love shade", the rancher said. "I suppose    1.5127085093302464
because it saves them some loss of body water. They'll move around    1.6432600607208703
that rock all day, following the shade. During the hottest part of    1.6432600607208703
the day, of course, the sun comes straight down and there isn't any    1.67495327387791
shade".   We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land Rover,    1.6065767145351917
and walked over toward the family.   The man was leaning against    1.6065767145351917
the rock. He gazed away from us as we approached. He was over    1.67495327387791
six feet tall and very thin. His legs were narrow and very long. Every    1.7026049541338664
bone and muscle in his body showed, but he did not give the appearance    1.7026049541338664
of starving. He had long black hair and a wispy beard. The ridges    1.67495327387791
over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut. There was something    1.7026049541338664
about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds    1.6065767145351917
to realize what. It was not merely that flies were crawling over his    1.67495327387791
face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into    1.67495327387791
his eye sockets. A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into    1.6432600607208703
the socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and across the wet    1.7026049541338664
surface of the eyeball, and the eye did not blink. The Australian    1.6432600607208703
and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered    1.6432600607208703
by insects, but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.   1.6432600607208703
I turned to look at the lubra. She remained squatting on her heels    1.67495327387791
all the time we were there; like the man, she was entirely naked.    1.67495327387791
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family    1.67495327387791
possessions which were placed in front of her. There were two rubbing    1.6432600607208703
sticks for making fire, two stones shaped roughly like knives, a woven-root    1.6432600607208703
container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead    1.6432600607208703
body of some rodent. There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera,    1.7026049541338664
a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity    1.5636360329510388
and high accuracy. There was also a boomerang, elaborately carved. Everything    1.6065767145351917
was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects    1.6432600607208703
seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.   1.67495327387791
The two children, both boys, wandered around the Australian    1.5127085093302464
and me for a few moments and then returned to their work. They squatted    1.7026049541338664
on their heels with their heads bent far forward, their eyes only    1.6432600607208703
a few inches from the ground. They had located the runway of a colony    1.7026049541338664
of ants and as the ants came out of the ground, the boys picked them    1.7269387314284994
up, one at a time, and pinched them dead. The tiny bodies, dropped onto    1.7026049541338664
a dry leaf, made a pile as big as a small apple.   The odor    1.7026049541338664
here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines.    1.6065767145351917
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant. It was also    1.6432600607208703
subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied    1.67495327387791
innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed.    1.6065767145351917
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant.    1.67495327387791
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one. The smell is sexual, but    1.7026049541338664
so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.   Their    1.6065767145351917
skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost    1.7026049541338664
the consistency of a second skin. They roll at night in ashes to keep    1.7026049541338664
warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it. In spots    1.7026049541338664
such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized    1.7269387314284994
the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating    1.6432600607208703
of sweat, dirt, and ashes were a cosmetic. The boys had beautiful    1.6432600607208703
dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies    1.6432600607208703
and blinked their eyes.   "That smell is something, eh, mate"?    1.5636360329510388
the Australian asked. "They swear that every person smells    1.5127085093302464
different and every family smells different from every other. At the    1.6065767145351917
<corroborees,> when they get to dancing and sweating, you'll see    1.5636360329510388
them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good    1.67495327387791
smell. Idje, here", and he nodded at the man, "is said to have    1.67495327387791
great odor. The stink is all the same to me, but I really think they    1.7269387314284994
can make one another out blindfolded".   "Here, Idje, you    1.5127085093302464
fella like tabac"? he said sharply. Idje still stared over our shoulders    1.6432600607208703
at the horizon. The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin    1.6065767145351917
I could understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.   1.6432600607208703
It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the seventeenth    1.6432600607208703
century was a great period in Persian art. The architects, the tile    1.6432600607208703
and carpet makers, the potters, painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths    1.5127085093302464
worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich    1.6065767145351917
the city. Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by    1.5636360329510388
what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales    1.6432600607208703
and roses, cut by canals and terraced promenades, studded with    1.5636360329510388
water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening    1.6065767145351917
blue curves of a hundred domes. At the heart of all of this was the square,    1.748515906000203
which one such traveler declared to be "as spacious, as pleasant    1.6065767145351917
and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe". In time Isfahan    1.6432600607208703
came to be known as "half the world", Isfahan <nisf-i-jahan>.   1.5636360329510388
In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city, then the    1.5636360329510388
size of London, started to decline. The Afghans invaded; the Safavids    1.6065767145351917
fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached.    1.5636360329510388
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place, and now it is    1.67495327387791
for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of    1.67495327387791
old Persia and sometimes of the East. They think of it as a kind of    1.7269387314284994
spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.   1.7026049541338664
Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky    1.5636360329510388
at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight. But even for them it    1.7269387314284994
remains a museum, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb,    1.7026049541338664
a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead. Everyone    1.6432600607208703
is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost no one is    1.67495327387791
willing to acknowledge their present. It seems that for Persia, and    1.6065767145351917
especially for this city, there are only two times: the glorious past    1.6432600607208703
and the corrupt, depressing, sterile present. The one apparent connection    1.5636360329510388
between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other    1.6432600607208703
have survived and which naturally enough are called "historical monuments".   1.5636360329510388
However, just as all the buildings have not fallen and    1.5636360329510388
flowed back to their original mud, so the values which wanted them    1.6432600607208703
and saw that they were built have not all disappeared. The values and    1.67495327387791
talents which made the tile and the dome, the rug, the poem and the miniature,    1.7269387314284994
continue in certain social institutions which rise above the    1.5127085093302464
ordinary life of this city, as the great buildings rise above blank walls    1.67495327387791
and dirty lanes. Often, too, the social institutions are housed    1.5636360329510388
in these pavilions and palaces and bridges, for these great structures    1.6065767145351917
are not simply "historical monuments"; they are the places where    1.5636360329510388
Persians live.   The promenade, for example, continues to take    1.5127085093302464
place on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees    1.67495327387791
that now serves as the city's principal street. ?t takes place    1.6065767145351917
as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge,    1.67495327387791
and also in the gardens of the square. On Fridays, the day when    1.67495327387791
many Persians relax with poetry, talk, and a samovar, people do not,    1.6432600607208703
it is true, stream into Chehel Sotun- a pavilion and garden built    1.6432600607208703
by Shah Abbas /2, in the seventeenth century- but they do retire    1.6432600607208703
into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley,    1.6432600607208703
which are smaller, more humble copies of the former. And of course    1.6432600607208703
religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques, and commercial    1.6432600607208703
life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar. Those    1.5636360329510388
three other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the teahouse,    1.6065767145351917
and the <zur khaneh> (the latter a kind of club in which a leader    1.7026049541338664
and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics,    1.7269387314284994
dance, chanted poetry, and music), do not take place in buildings    1.6065767145351917
to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them occupy splendid    1.6432600607208703
examples of Persian domestic architecture: long, domed, chalk-white    1.4513752902486308
rooms with daises of turquoise tile, their end walls cut through    1.6065767145351917
to the orchards and the sky by open arches.   But more important,    1.6432600607208703
and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often    1.6432600607208703
do not see, is that these places and activities are often the settings    1.67495327387791
in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities.    1.4513752902486308
Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the human form- these things    1.5636360329510388
are important to Persians, and they experience them with an intense    1.6065767145351917
and discriminating awareness.   I should like, by the way, to make    1.6065767145351917
it clear that I am not using the word "Persians" carelessly.    1.6065767145351917
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations, like    1.6432600607208703
a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool. These things    1.7026049541338664
are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to    1.6065767145351917
the most ordinary. The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's    1.7026049541338664
night are as often as not the <lutihaw,> mustachioed toughs    1.5636360329510388
who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons, brothels,    1.7026049541338664
and teahouses. A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord    1.6432600607208703
who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring    1.748515906000203
famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor. Not long    1.6065767145351917
ago an acquaintance, a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw    1.7026049541338664
of the city, stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks.    1.67495327387791
The air, he said, was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly    1.6432600607208703
good. I really didn't know what he meant. It was a nice day,    1.67495327387791
granted. But <he> knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his    1.67495327387791
lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.   The natural world    1.6432600607208703
then, plus poetry and some kinds of art, receives from the most ordinary    1.67495327387791
of Persians a great deal of attention. The line of an eyebrow,    1.6432600607208703
the color of the skin, a ghazal from Hafiz, the purity of spring water,    1.7026049541338664
the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of    1.6432600607208703
a pavilion- these things are noticed, judged, and valued.   Nowhere    1.5636360329510388
in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so    1.6432600607208703
well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge. There has probably    1.6432600607208703
always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the    1.67495327387791
city. For one thing, there is a natural belt of rock across the river    1.7026049541338664
bed; for another, it was here that one of the old caravan routes came    1.7026049541338664
in. It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans,    1.67495327387791
and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah Abbas /2,    1.67495327387791
in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick, tile, and stone, the present    1.6432600607208703
bridge. It is a splendid structure. From upstream it looks like a    1.6432600607208703
long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream, where the    1.6065767145351917
water level is much lower, it is a high, elaborately facaded pavilion.   1.6432600607208703
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from    1.5636360329510388
each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile. At either end and    1.67495327387791
in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed    1.67495327387791
and capacious as church apses. Here, in the old days- when they    1.6432600607208703
had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and    1.7026049541338664
his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged    1.6432600607208703
in the smaller alcoves between.   Below, twenty vaults tunnel    1.5127085093302464
through the understructure of the bridge. These are traversed by    1.5636360329510388
another line of vaults, and thus rooms, arched on all four sides, are    1.67495327387791
formed. Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing    1.67495327387791
vista like a visual echo of piers and arches, while the vaults fronting    1.67495327387791
upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and    1.6065767145351917
river pools. Here, on the hottest day, it is cool beneath the stone    1.67495327387791
and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the    1.7026049541338664
vaults.   On the downstream, or "pavilion", side these vaults    1.5127085093302464
give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself. From the    1.67495327387791
terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the    1.6065767145351917
water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river.    1.67495327387791
Out of water, brick, and tile they have made far more than just a    1.7026049541338664
bridge.   On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops    1.5636360329510388
and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge. It    1.7269387314284994
is a great spectacle. The bridge itself rises up from the river, light-flared    1.67495327387791
and enormous, like the outdoor set for an epic opera. Crowds    1.6065767145351917
press along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the arcades,    1.67495327387791
massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege. All kinds    1.67495327387791
come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering    1.6065767145351917
over a deal; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes    1.67495327387791
who stand with the stillness of the blind, their eyes filmed with    1.6432600607208703
rheum and visions; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient    1.6065767145351917
limousines; students, civil servants, beggars, musicians, hawkers,    1.3761581156320553
and clowns. Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on    1.7026049541338664
carpets around a samovar. Below, people line the steps, as though on    1.6432600607208703
bleachers, to watch the sky and river. Above, in the tiled prosceniums    1.6432600607208703
of the alcoves, boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi, while at    1.67495327387791
the very bottom, in the vaults, the toughs and blades of the city hoot    1.7026049541338664
and bang their drums, drink arak, play dice, and dance.   Here    1.6065767145351917
in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important    1.6432600607208703
to them: poetry, water, the moon, a beautiful face. To a stranger    1.6432600607208703
their delight in these things may seem paradoxical, for Persians chase    1.6065767145351917
the golden calf as much as any people. Many of them, moreover, are    1.67495327387791
beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to    1.6065767145351917
ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant, the mullah, and the peasant.    1.67495327387791
Nonetheless, they take time out- much time- from the game of    1.6065767145351917
grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks.    1.67495327387791
Above all, they will stop in the middle of anything, anywhere,    1.6065767145351917
to hear or quote some poetry.   Poetry in Persian life is far    1.6432600607208703
more than a common ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by    1.67495327387791
antagonisms- all may stand. It contains, in fact, their whole outlook    1.6065767145351917
on life. And it is expressed, at least to their taste, in a perfect    1.7026049541338664
form. Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty.    1.6432600607208703
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the    1.67495327387791
libraries and museums. In Persia, where practically speaking there    1.5127085093302464
are no museums or libraries or, for that matter, hardly any books, the    1.67495327387791
twins run free.   It is perhaps difficult to conceive, but imagine    1.6065767145351917
that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End    1.6432600607208703
will gather to sing Marlowe, Herrick, Shakespeare, and perhaps some    1.5636360329510388
lyrics of their own. That, at any rate, is what happens at the Khaju    1.7026049541338664
bridge. Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the    1.7026049541338664
top arcade. Here in these little rooms- or stages arched open to    1.6432600607208703
the sky and river- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they    1.7026049541338664
may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian    1.7026049541338664
music is divided. Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute-    1.6432600607208703
one inducing pleasure, another generosity, another love, and so    1.5127085093302464
on, to include all of the emotions. The singer simply matches the poem    1.67495327387791
to a mode; for example, the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk    1.67495327387791
poem: "<They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And    1.6432600607208703
Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains; Go, tell his aged mother    1.6065767145351917
that her son Fought with a thousand foes, and he was one>".    1.6432600607208703
Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet: "<Know    1.67495327387791
ye, fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth, That    1.7026049541338664
here, with dust upon his eyes, Iraj, the sweet-tongued singer, lies.    1.6065767145351917
In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred>    1.6432600607208703
**h".   These songs (practically all Persian music, for    1.4513752902486308
that matter) are limited to a range of two octaves. Yet within this    1.67495327387791
limitation there is an astonishing variety: design as intricate as    1.5636360329510388
that in the carpet or miniature, with the melodic line like the painted    1.67495327387791
or woven line often flowing into an arabesque.    1.4513752902486308
<Die Frist ist um, und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr,> the    1.6065767145351917
Maestro quoted <The Flying Dutchman,> as he told of his career    1.6065767145351917
and wanderings, explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred    1.5636360329510388
in his life several times.   The music director of the Pittsburgh    1.6065767145351917
Symphony Orchestra, William Steinberg, has molded his group    1.4513752902486308
into a prominent musical organization, which is his life. When he    1.6065767145351917
added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London    1.5636360329510388
Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958, he conducted one hundred fifty concerts    1.5636360329510388
within nine months, "commuting" between the two cities. This    1.5127085093302464
schedule became too strenuous, even for the energetic and conscientious    1.5636360329510388
Mr& Steinberg. His London contract was rescinded, and now, he    1.5636360329510388
explains cheerfully, as a bright smile lightens his intense, mobile face,    1.6065767145351917
"I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts"!   Our    1.5127085093302464
meeting took place in May, 1961, during one of the Maestro's stop-overs    1.6432600607208703
in New York, before he left for Europe. As we began to converse    1.67495327387791
in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel, his restlessness and    1.6065767145351917
sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent. Seeking    1.5127085093302464
an obscure, dark, relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise    1.6065767145351917
suffused with afternoon sunshine, he asked if the soft background music    1.6065767145351917
could be turned off. Unfortunately, it was Muzak, which automatically    1.5636360329510388
is piped into the public rooms, and which <nolens volens> had to    1.6432600607208703
be endured. As he talked about himself, time and again stuffing and    1.6432600607208703
dragging on his pipe, Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried    1.6432600607208703
feeling grew faint and was dispelled.   Did he come from a musical    1.6432600607208703
family? Yes: though not professional musicians, they were a    1.5127085093302464
music-loving family. In his native Cologne, where his mother taught    1.5636360329510388
him to play the piano, he was able to read notes before he learned the    1.7269387314284994
alphabet. She even devised a system of colors, whereby the boy could    1.6432600607208703
easily distinguish the different note values. When he started school    1.5636360329510388
at the age of five-and-a-half, he could not understand why the alphabet    1.6432600607208703
begins with the letter ~A, instead of ~C, as in the scale. Because,    1.67495327387791
like many other children, he intensely disliked practicing Czerny    1.5127085093302464
<Etudes,> he composed his own studies. When he was eight he began    1.6432600607208703
violin lessons. Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra,    1.6065767145351917
and during World War /1,, when musicians were scarce, he    1.5636360329510388
joined the opera orchestra as well. Steinberg claims that these early    1.6065767145351917
years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career.    1.6065767145351917
"By observing the conductor", he says with a twinkle in his    1.6065767145351917
eyes, "I learned how not to conduct".   The musician ran away    1.6065767145351917
from school when he was fifteen, but this escapade did not save him    1.67495327387791
from the Gymnasium. Simultaneously, he pursued his musical studies    1.5127085093302464
at the conservatory, receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony,    1.5636360329510388
as well in the violin and piano. His professional career began when    1.6432600607208703
he was twenty; he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant    1.5127085093302464
at the Cologne Opera, and a year later was promoted to the position    1.67495327387791
of regular conductor.   Wasn't this an unusually young age to    1.5636360329510388
fill such a responsible post? Yes, the Maestro assented.   Had    1.5636360329510388
he always wished to be a conductor? No, originally he had hoped    1.6432600607208703
to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such. However,    1.6432600607208703
when he assumed the duties of a conductor, he relinquished his career    1.6432600607208703
as a pianist.   Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera,    1.6065767145351917
after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky, teacher    1.6432600607208703
of Arnold Scho^nberg and Erich Korngold. In 1927 he succeeded    1.5636360329510388
Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague.    1.5636360329510388
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin    1.6065767145351917
State Opera. Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera,    1.6432600607208703
where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the    1.6432600607208703
rise of the Hitler regime. During these years the youthful conductor    1.6065767145351917
had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany.    1.6432600607208703
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's    1.5127085093302464
<Manon Lescaut> and de Falla's    1.1606783668269585
<La Vida Breve>. The Frankfurt    1.1606783668269585
years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's    1.5127085093302464
<Wozzek> soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber,    1.5127085093302464
and the world premiere of Scho^nberg's <Von heute auf morgen>.    1.5636360329510388
At the outset of his career, Steinberg had dedicated himself to the    1.6432600607208703
advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Scho^nberg work    1.6065767145351917
every year. In Frankfurt, too, he directed the Museum and Opera    1.6065767145351917
House concerts which, in addition to the standard repertoire, featured    1.5636360329510388
novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth    1.4513752902486308
Symphony.   Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the    1.5636360329510388
1930's,    1.0
Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish    1.5636360329510388
community. Through the Frankfurt Jewish <Kulturbund> he began    1.4513752902486308
to give sonata recitals in synagogues, with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann.    1.5636360329510388
As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional    1.6065767145351917
organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt <Kulturbund>    1.4513752902486308
Orchestra, which also gave guest performances in other German    1.5127085093302464
cities. In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin <Kulturbund>.    1.6065767145351917
In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin    1.6432600607208703
and Frankfurt <Kulturbund> orchestras joined under the combined efforts    1.5127085093302464
of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine    1.5127085093302464
Orchestra- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra- with    1.5127085093302464
Steinberg as founder-conductor.   In 1938, at the insistence    1.4513752902486308
of Arturo Toscanini, Steinberg left Germany for the United States,    1.5636360329510388
by way of Switzerland. After he had spent the first three years    1.6432600607208703
in New York as associate conductor, at Toscanini's invitation, of    1.5636360329510388
the ~NBC Orchestra, he made numerous guest appearances throughout    1.5127085093302464
the United States and Latin America. In 1945 he became conductor    1.6065767145351917
of the Buffalo Philharmonic. Seven years later he was asked to become    1.6432600607208703
director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. Since 1944 he has also conducted    1.6065767145351917
regularly at the San Francisco Opera, where he made his debut    1.6065767145351917
with a memorable performance of Verdi's <Falstaff>. In recent    1.5127085093302464
years he has traveled widely in Europe, conducting in Italy, France,    1.6065767145351917
Austria, and Switzerland. He returned to Germany for the first    1.5636360329510388
time in 1953, where he has since conducted in Cologne, Frankfurt,    1.6065767145351917
and Berlin.   Where in Europe was he going now?   First    1.5636360329510388
of all, to Italy for a short vacation- Forte dei Marmi, a place    1.67495327387791
he loves. Since it is not far from Viareggio, he will visit Puccini's    1.67495327387791
house, as he never fails to do, to pay his respects to the memory    1.7026049541338664
of the composer of <La Boheme,> which he considers one of Puccini's    1.6432600607208703
masterpieces. Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about    1.4513752902486308
Italy: "Rome is my second home. I consider it the center of the    1.67495327387791
world and make it a point to be there once a year". He will conduct    1.7269387314284994
two concerts at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, as well as concerts    1.6432600607208703
in Munich and Cologne. "Then I return to the United States    1.6065767145351917
for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia", he    1.5636360329510388
added.   The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to    1.5127085093302464
be of unusual interest. There will be premieres of new works, made possible    1.67495327387791
through Ford Foundation commissions: Carlisle Floyd's <Mystery,>    1.3761581156320553
with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist. Other world premieres    1.5127085093302464
will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's    1.5127085093302464
<Samba Concertante>.   "And next year we will do- also    1.5127085093302464
a Ford commission- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter, with Jacob    1.6065767145351917
Lateiner as soloist. Of course, I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner    1.6065767145351917
works in the coming season, as usual. We'll play Bruckner's    1.5636360329510388
Fifth Symphony in the original version, and Mahler's Seventh-    1.5127085093302464
the least accessible, known, and played of Mahler's works. My Pittsburghers    1.6065767145351917
have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner".   1.4513752902486308
He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters    1.6432600607208703
on tour, especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies, and    1.5127085093302464
<Das Lied von der Erde,> and Bruckner's Sixth- which is rarely    1.6065767145351917
played- and Seventh. Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as "my    1.5636360329510388
travel symphony". He recalled that in California after a critic    1.5636360329510388
had attacked him for "still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans",    1.6432600607208703
the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.   1.6065767145351917
"Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and    1.5127085093302464
my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us, I am probably    1.67495327387791
the only one- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein-    1.5636360329510388
who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner    1.6432600607208703
and Mahler".   Since he introduces so much modern music,    1.5127085093302464
I could not resist asking how he felt about it.   "There was    1.6432600607208703
always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era    1.67495327387791
in which it was created. But I usually stick to the old phrase:    1.67495327387791
<'Ich habe ein Amt, aber keine Meinung> (I hold an office, but    1.6432600607208703
I do not feel entitled to have an opinion). I consider it to be my    1.7269387314284994
job to expose the public to what is being written today".   With    1.6432600607208703
all his musical activities, did he have the time and inclination to    1.6432600607208703
do anything else? He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection    1.7026049541338664
to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals.    1.5636360329510388
He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain,    1.5636360329510388
but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able    1.6432600607208703
to see in Paris a year ago.   And how did he feel about modern    1.7026049541338664
art? Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he    1.6432600607208703
was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments. "As my wife puts    1.67495327387791
it", he said, again with a twinkle in his eyes, "all you know is    1.7026049541338664
your music. But after all, you never learned anything else"!   1.5636360329510388
What did he do for relaxation? Like his late colleague, Mitropoulos,    1.6065767145351917
he reads mystery stories, in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.    1.5636360329510388
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature.   1.5127085093302464
But his prime interest, apart from music, he insisted seriously, was    1.6065767145351917
his family- his wife, daughter and son. At the moment he was excited    1.67495327387791
about his son's having received the Prix de Rome in archaeology    1.6065767145351917
and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation    1.6432600607208703
of an Etruscan tomb. "Both children are musical and my wife is    1.6432600607208703
a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment".    1.4513752902486308
"IS the attitude of German youth comparable to that of "the    1.6065767145351917
angry    1.0
young men' of England"? was the topic for a round-table discussion    1.6065767145351917
at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich.   I was chairman,    1.5127085093302464
the only not youthful participant. Since attack serves to stimulate    1.5636360329510388
interest in broadcasts, I added to my opening statement a sentence in    1.6432600607208703
which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which    1.6432600607208703
is a necessary ingredient of anger, and might be classified as uninterested    1.6432600607208703
and bored rather than angry. I was far from convinced of the    1.6432600607208703
truth of my statement, but could not think of anything that might evoke    1.67495327387791
responses more quickly.   "It is easy for you to talk";    1.5636360329510388
countered a twenty year old law student, "you travel around the world.    1.6432600607208703
We would like to do that too".   "But you want a job guaranteed    1.67495327387791
when you return", I continued my attack. "You must have    1.5636360329510388
some security", said a young clerk.   When I mentioned that    1.5636360329510388
for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return    1.7269387314284994
fare, but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount,    1.67495327387791
the young people looked at me doubtingly. One girl expressed what was    1.6432600607208703
obviously in their minds.   "Would you advise us to act the    1.6065767145351917
same way? You might have failed. I think it is rather foolhardy to    1.67495327387791
trust to luck".   Others mentioned that I might have had to    1.6065767145351917
ask    1.0
friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign    1.7026049541338664
country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international    1.5127085093302464
understanding.   The debate needed no additional controversy    1.3761581156320553
and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life, what    1.67495327387791
his hopes were and what his fears.   Though the four boys and    1.6432600607208703
two girls, the youngest nineteen years of age, the oldest twenty-four,    1.6065767145351917
came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal    1.5636360329510388
interests, there was surprising agreement among them. What they    1.5127085093302464
wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political    1.67495327387791
instability in their own country.   The ideal home, they    1.5127085093302464
agreed, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to    1.7026049541338664
five rooms, just enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and    1.6432600607208703
two children. No one wanted a larger family or no children, and none    1.67495327387791
hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would    1.67495327387791
be satisfactory.   All expressed interest in world affairs    1.4513752902486308
but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.    1.6432600607208703
ONCE again, as in the days of the Founding Fathers, America    1.6065767145351917
faces a stern test. That test, as President Kennedy forthrightly    1.5636360329510388
depicted it in his State of the Union message, will determine "whether    1.6432600607208703
a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure".   1.5636360329510388
It is well then that in this hour both of "national peril"    1.6432600607208703
and of "national opportunity" we can take counsel with the men who    1.6432600607208703
made the nation. Incapable of self-delusion, the Founding Fathers    1.5127085093302464
found the crisis of their time to be equally grave, and yet they had    1.7026049541338664
confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free    1.6432600607208703
peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.   1.7026049541338664
Seven Founders- George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,    1.2818970554302986
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James    1.3761581156320553
Madison and John Jay- determined the destinies of the new nation.    1.6065767145351917
In certain respects, their task was incomparably greater than ours today,    1.6065767145351917
for there was nobody before them to show them the way. As Madison    1.67495327387791
commented to Jefferson in 1789, "We are in a wilderness without    1.6065767145351917
a single footstep to guide us. Our successors will have an easier task".   1.67495327387791
They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words,    1.4513752902486308
as "the Argonauts" who had lived in "the Heroic Age". Accordingly,    1.6065767145351917
they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential    1.5636360329510388
sources for posterity. Their writings assume more than dramatic or    1.5636360329510388
patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in    1.5636360329510388
which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but, rather,    1.6065767145351917
as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen,    1.6065767145351917
that "with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved".   1.6432600607208703
Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point    1.5127085093302464
of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven were essentially    1.5127085093302464
congenial minds, and their agreements with each other were more consequential    1.6065767145351917
than their differences. Even though in most cases the completion    1.5636360329510388
of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off,    1.6065767145351917
enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing    1.5127085093302464
a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual    1.6432600607208703
feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.   1.5636360329510388
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember    1.6432600607208703
that their separate careers were extraordinary. Certainly no other    1.5127085093302464
seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in    1.6065767145351917
so concentrated a span of years.   Eldest of the seven, Benjamin    1.6065767145351917
Franklin, a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the    1.5127085093302464
most dazzling success story in our history. The young printer's apprentice    1.6065767145351917
achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields, as editor    1.5127085093302464
and publisher, scientist, inventor, philanthropist and statesman.    1.3761581156320553
Author of the Albany Plan of Union, which, had it been adopted, might    1.67495327387791
have avoided the Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line    1.5127085093302464
battles in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and    1.6065767145351917
the peace that ended the war, headed the state government of Pennsylvania,    1.6432600607208703
and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal    1.5127085093302464
ON a military mission for his native Virginia    1.4513752902486308
the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian    1.5636360329510388
War, then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia.    1.6065767145351917
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution,    1.6065767145351917
he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory. Retiring    1.5636360329510388
to his beloved Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal    1.6432600607208703
Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected    1.6432600607208703
President. During his two terms the Constitution was tested and    1.5636360329510388
found workable, strong national policies were inaugurated, and the    1.5127085093302464
traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed.    1.5127085093302464
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology, wrote    1.5127085093302464
the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts, negotiated,    1.5127085093302464
with Franklin and Jay, the peace with Britain and served as our first    1.67495327387791
HIS political    1.0
opponent and lifetime friend, Thomas Jefferson, achieved immortality    1.4513752902486308
through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, but    1.5127085093302464
equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted    1.5636360329510388
in his native Virginia, his role as father of our territorial system,    1.6432600607208703
and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first    1.5636360329510388
term as President.   During the greater part of Jefferson's    1.5127085093302464
career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian, James    1.6065767145351917
Madison, eight years his junior. The active sponsor of Jefferson's    1.5636360329510388
measure for religious liberty in Virginia, Madison played the most    1.5636360329510388
influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in    1.6065767145351917
securing its ratification in Virginia, founded the first political    1.5127085093302464
party in American history, and, as Jefferson's Secretary of State    1.5636360329510388
and his successor in the Presidency, guided the nation through the    1.6065767145351917
troubled years of our second war with Britain.   If Franklin was    1.6065767145351917
an authentic genius, then Alexander Hamilton, with his exceptional    1.5127085093302464
precocity, consuming energy, and high ambition, was a political prodigy.    1.5636360329510388
His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was only 19, quickly    1.5636360329510388
brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders. Principal author    1.6065767145351917
of "The Federalist", he swung New York over from opposition    1.5636360329510388
to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly. His    1.4513752902486308
collaboration with Washington, begun when he was the general's aide    1.5636360329510388
during the Revolution, was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet    1.6065767145351917
as Secretary of the Treasury. His bold fiscal program and his broad    1.6432600607208703
interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions.    1.4513752902486308
LESS dazzling than Hamilton, less eloquent than Jefferson,    1.4513752902486308
John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers.    1.6065767145351917
He served as president of the Continental Congress. He played    1.5636360329510388
the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that    1.6065767145351917
ended the Revolution, and directed America's foreign affairs throughout    1.5127085093302464
the Confederation period. As first Chief Justice, his strong    1.5127085093302464
nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall. He ended his public    1.5127085093302464
career as a two-term governor of New York.   These Seven Founders    1.6065767145351917
constituted an intellectual and social elite, the most respectable    1.5127085093302464
and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed. Their    1.4513752902486308
social status was achieved in some cases by birth, as with Washington,    1.6432600607208703
Jefferson and Jay; in others by business and professional acumen,    1.5636360329510388
as with Franklin and Adams, or, in Hamilton's case, by an influential    1.6432600607208703
marriage. Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals    1.4513752902486308
in underdeveloped nations of our own day, they commanded both prestige    1.6065767145351917
and influence before the Revolution started.   As different    1.4513752902486308
physically as the tall, angular Jefferson was from the chubby, rotund    1.6065767145351917
Adams, the seven were striking individualists. Ardent, opinionated,    1.4513752902486308
even obstinate, they were amazingly articulate, wrote their own copy,    1.5636360329510388
CAPABLE of enduring friendships,    1.0
they were also stout controversialists, who could write with    1.5127085093302464
a drop of vitriol on their pens. John Adams dismissed John Dickinson,    1.6432600607208703
who voted against the Declaration of Independence, as "a certain    1.5636360329510388
great fortune and piddling genius". Washington castigated his    1.4513752902486308
critic, General Conway, as being capable of "all the meanness of intrigue    1.6432600607208703
to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity". And    1.5127085093302464
Hamilton, who felt it "a religious duty" to oppose Aaron Burr's    1.6065767145351917
political ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk had    1.5636360329510388
he shown more literary restraint.   The Seven Founders were    1.5127085093302464
completely dedicated to the public service. Madison once remarked:    1.5127085093302464
"My life has been so much a public one", a comment which fits the    1.7026049541338664
careers of the other six. Franklin retired from editing and publishing    1.6065767145351917
at the age of 42, and for the next forty-two years devoted himself    1.67495327387791
to public, scientific, and philanthropic interests. Washington never    1.4513752902486308
had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved    1.7026049541338664
best, plantation management. He served as Commander in Chief during    1.5636360329510388
JOHN ADAMS took    1.0
to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley,    1.6432600607208703
to "pursue the study of the law, rather than the gain of it". In    1.7026049541338664
taking account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded    1.5636360329510388
that "no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did"    1.67495327387791
and "for so little profit". When the Revolution broke out, he, along    1.6432600607208703
with Jefferson and Jay, abandoned his career at the bar, with considerable    1.6432600607208703
financial sacrifice.   Hamilton, poorest of the seven,    1.3761581156320553
gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet.    1.5636360329510388
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of    1.5127085093302464
the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends.    1.6432600607208703
"If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars", he wrote    1.6065767145351917
one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury.   To    1.6432600607208703
support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell    1.67495327387791
of public service. Talleyrand passed his New York law office one    1.6065767145351917
night on the way to a party. Hamilton was bent over his desk, drafting    1.7026049541338664
a legal paper by the light of a candle. The Frenchman was astonished.    1.67495327387791
"I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune    1.67495327387791
of his country, but now is working all night in order to support his    1.7026049541338664
ALL seven combined ardent devotion    1.1606783668269585
to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality. John    1.6432600607208703
Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of    1.4513752902486308
Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their    1.6432600607208703
charters, the British Constitution and the common law, and Jefferson    1.5636360329510388
appealed in the Declaration of Independence "to the tribunal of    1.5636360329510388
the world" for support of a revolution justified by "the laws of    1.6432600607208703
nature and of nature's God".   They fought hard, but they were    1.6065767145351917
forgiving to former foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures    1.5636360329510388
from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of    1.5636360329510388
1783.   This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified    1.5636360329510388
in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee,    1.6432600607208703
Peter Van Schaack. Jay had participated in the decision that exiled    1.6065767145351917
his old friend Van Schaack. Yet when, at war's end, the ex-Tory    1.6432600607208703
made the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote him from    1.6065767145351917
Paris, where he was negotiating the peace settlement:    1.4513752902486308
"As    1.0
an independent American I considered all who were not for us, and you    1.67495327387791
amongst the rest, as against us, yet be assured that John Jay never    1.67495327387791
ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack".   The latter    1.6065767145351917
in turn assured him that "were I arraigned at the bar, and you my    1.7026049541338664
judge, I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause".   1.7269387314284994
All seven recognized that independence was but the first    1.5127085093302464
step toward building a nation. "We have now a national character    1.6065767145351917
to establish", Washington wrote in 1783. "Think continentally",    1.4513752902486308
Hamilton counseled the young nation. This new force, love of country,    1.6065767145351917
super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's    1.5127085093302464
own state, was epitomized by Washington. His first inaugural    1.5127085093302464
address speaks of "my country whose voice I can never hear but with    1.67495327387791
veneration and love".   All sought the fruition of that nationalism    1.5636360329510388
in a Federal Government with substantial powers. Save Jefferson,    1.5127085093302464
all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal    1.5636360329510388
Constitution. They supported it, not as a perfect instrument, but as    1.6065767145351917
the best obtainable. Historians have traditionally regarded the great    1.5127085093302464
debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized    1.6065767145351917
vs& limited government, with Hamilton and the nationalists    1.4513752902486308
supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter    1.5636360329510388
THE state's rights position was formulated by    1.3761581156320553
Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves, but    1.5636360329510388
in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better    1.67495327387791
Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians. In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson    1.3761581156320553
had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution,    1.5127085093302464
and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's    1.5636360329510388
bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception, and in    1.6432600607208703
adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff. Indeed, the old Jeffersonians    1.5127085093302464
were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they    1.5636360329510388
WHEN, in 1832, the South    1.1606783668269585
Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition    1.4513752902486308
which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited    1.6065767145351917
no encouragement from that senior statesman. In his political testament,    1.5636360329510388
"Advice to My Country", penned just before his death, Madison    1.5636360329510388
expressed the wish "that the Union of the States be cherished    1.6065767145351917
and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora    1.67495327387791
with her box opened; and the disguised one, as the serpent creeping    1.6432600607208703
with his deadly wiles into Paradise".    1.2818970554302986
Nostalgic Yankee    1.0
readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians    1.5636360329510388
that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway, over    1.6065767145351917
which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the    1.5636360329510388
Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop. Thus we are compelled    1.6065767145351917
to face the urbanization of the South- an urbanization which, despite    1.6065767145351917
its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture,    1.5127085093302464
has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers. Indeed, it    1.6432600607208703
seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road,    1.5636360329510388
with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint    1.6065767145351917
juleps, continue to live- but only as a weary, overexploited phantom.   1.6065767145351917
Those writers known collectively as the "Southern school"    1.4513752902486308
have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize;    1.6065767145351917
according to many critics, in fact, the South has led the North    1.6432600607208703
in literature since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively.    1.5636360329510388
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren    1.5127085093302464
have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum    1.7026049541338664
renaissance. It is interesting, however, that despite this    1.4513752902486308
strong upsurge in Southern writing, almost none of the writers has    1.6065767145351917
forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel    1.5636360329510388
sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the    1.6432600607208703
season's cotton and tobacco crops; of the stereotyped Negro servants    1.5636360329510388
chanting hymns as they plow the fields; of these and a host of    1.67495327387791
other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps    1.5636360329510388
of the past century. This is not to say that the South is no longer    1.7269387314284994
agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification.    1.6065767145351917
But the South is, and has been for the past century, engaged    1.6432600607208703
in a wide-sweeping urbanization which, oddly enough, is not reflected    1.5636360329510388
in its literature.   In 1900 the South was only 15% urban;    1.6065767145351917
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban. In a mere half-century the South    1.67495327387791
has more than tripled its urban status. There is a New South emerging,    1.67495327387791
a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with    1.6065767145351917
the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades. As    1.5636360329510388
the New South snowballs toward further urbanization, it becomes more    1.5636360329510388
and more homogeneous with the North- a tendency which Willard    1.5636360329510388
Thorp terms "Yankeefication", as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte,    1.5636360329510388
Birmingham, and Houston. It is said that, even at the present    1.6065767145351917
stage of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly    1.6432600607208703
unlike Columbus or Trenton. Undoubtedly even the old Southern    1.5127085093302464
stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind: William Styron mentions    1.5636360329510388
in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder, a Civil    1.6432600607208703
War general, now renamed, in typical California fashion, "Buena    1.5127085093302464
Vista Terrace". The effects of television and other mass media    1.5636360329510388
are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force.    1.5636360329510388
As for progress, the "backward South" can boast of Baton Rouge,    1.6065767145351917
which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred    1.6065767145351917
and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second largest growth of the period    1.6432600607208703
for all cities over 25,000.   The field, then, is ripe for    1.6065767145351917
new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century    1.6432600607208703
phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication: the new urban economy,    1.4513752902486308
the city-dweller, the pains of transition, the labor problems; the    1.5636360329510388
list is, obviously, endless. But these sources have not been tapped.    1.6065767145351917
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism, exaggerating    1.5127085093302464
the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque, but    1.5636360329510388
as unreal as- or even <more> unreal than- yesterday. William    1.5636360329510388
Styron, while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance,    1.6065767145351917
insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and    1.6432600607208703
yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes.    1.5127085093302464
Even the great god Faulkner, the South's one probable contender    1.5636360329510388
for literary immortality, has little concerned himself with these matters;    1.5636360329510388
such are simply not within his bounded province.   Where    1.5127085093302464
are the writers to treat these changes? Has the agrarian tradition    1.6065767145351917
become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded    1.6432600607208703
or unwanted? Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the    1.5127085093302464
older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated    1.6065767145351917
testings over the decades. Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to    1.5636360329510388
write of a <new> economy, these writers seem to be contenting themselves    1.6432600607208703
with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.   1.6432600607208703
An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region    1.6432600607208703
may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in    1.6432600607208703
the white-dominated society, a problem that has been reflected in regional    1.6065767145351917
fiction especially since 1865. Today the Negro must discover his    1.5636360329510388
role in an <industrialized> South, which indicates that the racial    1.5636360329510388
aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically, but rather    1.5636360329510388
has gradually come to be reflected in this new context, this new coat    1.67495327387791
of paint. The Negro faces as much, if not more, difficulty in fitting    1.67495327387791
himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one. This    1.67495327387791
represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem. But there    1.6065767145351917
have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins, the picket lines,    1.6065767145351917
the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago.    1.6432600607208703
Today's evidence, such as the fact that only three Southern states    1.6065767145351917
(South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi) still openly defy integration,    1.5127085093302464
would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness.   1.5127085093302464
Other examples of <gradual> changes that have    1.3761581156320553
affected the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the busses;    1.7026049541338664
his requesting, and often getting, higher wages, better working conditions,    1.5636360329510388
better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before    1.5127085093302464
the Supreme Court decision of 1954. Then came this decision, which    1.6065767145351917
sped the process of gaining equality (or perhaps hindered it; only    1.6065767145351917
historical evolution will determine which): an <abrupt> change.   1.4513752902486308
Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led    1.5636360329510388
to an ironically anarchical rebellion. He has frequently refused to move    1.6065767145351917
from white lunch counters, refused to obey <local> laws which he    1.6065767145351917
considers unjust, while in other cases he has appealed to <federal>    1.6065767145351917
laws. This bold self-assertion, after decades of humble subservience,    1.5127085093302464
is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon, an abrupt change in the Southern    1.6065767145351917
way of existence. A new order is thrusting itself into being.    1.6065767145351917
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation,    1.6065767145351917
uncertainty, and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role    1.67495327387791
in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white    1.5127085093302464
man.   The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern    1.6432600607208703
fiction. It is clear that, while most writers enjoy picturing    1.5636360329510388
the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble old agrarian who mutters "yassuhs"    1.6065767145351917
and "sho' nufs" with blissful deference to his white employer    1.5636360329510388
(or, in Old South terms, "massuh"), this stereotype is doomed    1.5636360329510388
to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester. While    1.5636360329510388
there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through    1.5636360329510388
the rural South, such men appear to be a vanishing breed. Writers    1.6432600607208703
openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man;    1.67495327387791
but they obviously mean by this, not a Negro personality, but a Negro    1.67495327387791
<type>. Presenting an individualized Negro character, it would    1.4513752902486308
seem, is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could    1.6432600607208703
tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is, as suggested above,    1.6432600607208703
glaringly rare.   Just as the Negro situation points up the    1.5636360329510388
gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life, it also points up    1.6065767145351917
the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature. The book    1.5127085093302464
concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed;    1.6432600607208703
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel, <Peaceable Lane>, has    1.4513752902486308
openly faced the problem.   All but the most rabid of Confederate    1.6065767145351917
flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in    1.6065767145351917
actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance    1.6065767145351917
of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid    1.5636360329510388
ante-bellum way of life. Many earlier writers, mourning the demise    1.5636360329510388
of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate this "gracious    1.6065767145351917
Old South" imagery, creating such lasting impressions as Margaret    1.5127085093302464
Mitchell's    1.0
"Tara" plantation. Modern writers, who are supposed    1.3761581156320553
to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist    1.6432600607208703
upon drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when it well deserves    1.6432600607208703
a rest after the overexploitation of the past century. Perhaps    1.5636360329510388
these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but    1.6065767145351917
they can hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama is dead.    1.67495327387791
As John T& Westbrook says in his article, "Twilight of Southern    1.6065767145351917
Regionalism" (<Southwest Review>, Winter 1957): "**h    1.2818970554302986
The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South, already too minutely    1.5636360329510388
autopsied in prose and poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever    1.67495327387791
dead and (let us fervently hope) forever done with".   Westbrook    1.5636360329510388
further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image    1.5636360329510388
of their homeland, which is too readily assimilated by both foreign    1.6065767145351917
readers and visiting Yankees: "Our northerner is suspicious of    1.5127085093302464
all this crass evidence [of urbanization] presented to his senses.    1.5636360329510388
It bewilders and befuddles him. He is too deeply steeped in William    1.6432600607208703
Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren. The fumes of progress are in his    1.6432600607208703
nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes, but his    1.67495327387791
heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night    1.6065767145351917
riders. On this trip to the South he wants, above all else, to sniff    1.7026049541338664
the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at    1.5127085093302464
least one barn burn at midnight". Obviously, such a Northern tourist's    1.6065767145351917
purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland:    1.5636360329510388
he <wants> to see a world of make-believe.   In the    1.5636360329510388
meantime, while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization    1.5636360329510388
that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee, Southern writers    1.5636360329510388
have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's    1.5636360329510388
progress. Willard Thorp, in his new book <American Writing in    1.5636360329510388
the Twentieth Century>, observes, quite validly it seems: "**h    1.5127085093302464
Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched.    1.6065767145351917
No southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what    1.5636360329510388
Herrick, Dreiser, and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did    1.6065767145351917
for New York **h There are almost no fictional treatments of the    1.6432600607208703
industrialized south". Not a single Southern author, major or minor,    1.5636360329510388
has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material.   1.67495327387791
Faulkner, for one, appears to be safe from the accusing    1.5636360329510388
fingers of all assailants in this regard. Faulkner culminates the    1.5636360329510388
Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been, or could    1.6432600607208703
ever be, done. He has made it his, and his it remains, irrevocably.    1.67495327387791
He treats it with a mythological, universal application.   As    1.5127085093302464
his disciples boast, even though his emphasis is elsewhere, Faulkner    1.5636360329510388
does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly,    1.67495327387791
as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes    1.67495327387791
families. Even two decades ago in <Go Down, Moses> Faulkner    1.5636360329510388
was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through    1.7026049541338664
its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the    1.7269387314284994
curse of slavery erased from its soil. Yet his concern even here is    1.67495327387791
with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general, and he never    1.6065767145351917
deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial    1.67495327387791
impact.   Faulkner traces, in his vast and overpowering saga    1.5127085093302464
of Yoknapatawpha County, the gradual changes which seep into the    1.5636360329510388
South, building layer upon layer of minute, subtle innovation which eventually    1.6065767145351917
tend largely to hide the Old Way. Thus Faulkner reminds    1.5636360329510388
us, and wisely, that the "new" South has gradually evolved out of    1.6432600607208703
the Old South, and consequently its agrarian roots persist. Yet he    1.6065767145351917
presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers    1.6432600607208703
if not himself: the problems with which a New South must grapple    1.6432600607208703
in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.    1.6065767145351917
With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of    1.6065767145351917
six men: a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil. The    1.6432600607208703
thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with    1.6432600607208703
even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually    1.5636360329510388
surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.   1.5127085093302464
Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual    1.6065767145351917
devices of the theatre. Most avant-garde creators, true to their    1.5636360329510388
interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement, have tended to dress    1.6065767145351917
their dancers in simple lines and solid colors (often black) and to    1.6432600607208703
give them a bare cyclorama for a setting. But Robert Rauschenberg,    1.6065767145351917
the neo-dadaist artist, has collaborated with several of them. He has    1.6065767145351917
designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white    1.6432600607208703
for Mr& Cunningham's <Summerspace>, so that dancers and background    1.5127085093302464
merge into a shimmering unity. For Mr& Taylor's <Images    1.5127085093302464
and Reflections> he made some diaphanous tents that alternately    1.5127085093302464
hide and reveal the performer, and a girl's cape lined with grass. Mr&    1.67495327387791
Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume    1.6065767145351917
and decor. In fact, he calls his productions dance-theatre works    1.5636360329510388
of motion, shape, light, and sound. To raise the dancer out of his personal,    1.7026049541338664
pedestrian self, Mr& Nikolais has experimented with relating    1.4513752902486308
him to a larger, environmental orbit. He began with masks to make    1.6432600607208703
the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be. He    1.6432600607208703
went on to use objects- hoops, poles, capes- which he employed as    1.6432600607208703
extensions of the body of the dancer, who moved with them. The depersonalization    1.67495327387791
continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play    1.5636360329510388
of lights upon his figure. In each case, the object, the color, even    1.67495327387791
the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become    1.6065767145351917
part of the theatrical being of the performer. The dancer who never    1.6432600607208703
loosens her hold on a parasol, begins to feel that it is part of herself.    1.7269387314284994
Or, clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of    1.67495327387791
hoops, the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a "finial".    1.7026049541338664
As the dancer is depersonalized, his accouterments are animized,    1.5127085093302464
and the combined elements give birth to a new being. From this being    1.67495327387791
come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single    1.6432600607208703
unit.   Thus, the avant-garde choreographers have extended the    1.4513752902486308
scope of materials available for dance composition. But, since they    1.5636360329510388
have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity, how are they    1.5636360329510388
to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal? Some    1.6065767145351917
look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply    1.67495327387791
corresponding methods to their own work. Others, less consciously    1.5127085093302464
but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times, experiment    1.6065767145351917
with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet, painter,    1.5636360329510388
and musician.   An approach that has appealed to some choreographers    1.5636360329510388
is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process    1.5127085093302464
of projective verse: "one perception must immediately and directly    1.5127085093302464
lead to a further perception". The creator trusts his intuition to    1.6065767145351917
lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors    1.6432600607208703
the reality of his experience. He disdains external restrictions- conventional    1.5636360329510388
syntax, traditional metre. The unit of form is determined    1.5127085093302464
subjectively: "the Heart, by the way of the Breath, to the Line".    1.6432600607208703
The test of form is fidelity to the experience, a gauge also accepted    1.67495327387791
by the abstract expressionist painters.   An earlier but    1.4513752902486308
still influential school of painting, surrealism, had suggested the way    1.5636360329510388
of dealing with the dream experience, that event in which seemingly    1.6065767145351917
incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations    1.5127085093302464
of the subconscious. The resulting picture might appear a maze of    1.6065767145351917
restless confusions and contradictions, but it is more true to life than    1.6432600607208703
a portrait of an artificially contrived order. The contemporary painter    1.5636360329510388
tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but    1.6065767145351917
their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines, colors, masses,    1.6065767145351917
and energies. He is still concerned, however, with a personal event.    1.6065767145351917
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence    1.6065767145351917
of the vitality of the experience of creation. The work must    1.6065767145351917
be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.   1.67495327387791
Some painters have less interest in the experience of the    1.5636360329510388
moment, with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities, than in looking    1.5636360329510388
beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher, more serene level    1.6432600607208703
of truth. Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations    1.5636360329510388
they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design, which symbolize    1.6432600607208703
an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world. The    1.6432600607208703
concept remains subjective. But in this approach it is the artist's    1.6065767145351917
ultimate insight, rather than his immediate impressions, that gives    1.5127085093302464
form to the work.   Others look to more objective devices of    1.6065767145351917
order. The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes    1.5636360329510388
a mathematical system of rotations that, once set in motion,    1.5636360329510388
determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities.    1.6065767145351917
The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of    1.67495327387791
intervals (or rhythms or dynamic changes). He may even alter the pattern    1.6432600607208703
by applying a scheme of random numbers. But he cannot order his    1.6432600607208703
elements by will, either rational or inspired. The system works as an    1.6432600607208703
impersonal mechanism. Musicians who use the chance method also exclude    1.5636360329510388
subjective control of formal development. Again, the composer must    1.5127085093302464
select his own materials. But a tossing of coins, with perhaps the added    1.67495327387791
safeguard of reference to the oracles of the <I Ching>, the Chinese    1.6432600607208703
Book of Changes, dictates the handling of the chosen materials.   1.5636360329510388
Avant-garde choreographers, seeking new forms of continuity    1.3761581156320553
for their new vocabulary of movements, have turned to similar approaches.    1.6065767145351917
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation.    1.6065767145351917
According to Katherine Litz, "the becoming, the process of realization,    1.5636360329510388
is the dance". The process stipulates that the choreographer    1.5127085093302464
sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that    1.6432600607208703
he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it. The sequence    1.7026049541338664
may involve a sharp contrast: for example, a quiet meditative sway    1.6065767145351917
of the body succeeded by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle    1.7026049541338664
distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged,    1.5127085093302464
its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified, or it may be transferred    1.6432600607208703
to become a movement of only the arms or the head. Even the least    1.7026049541338664
alteration will change the quality. An exploration of these possible    1.5636360329510388
relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form    1.5636360329510388
to the dance.   The approach to the depiction of the experience    1.6065767145351917
of creation may be analytic, as it is for Miss Litz, or spontaneous,    1.67495327387791
as it is for Merle Marsicano. She, too, is concerned with "the    1.6432600607208703
becoming, the process of realization", but she does not think in    1.6065767145351917
terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns. The design    1.6065767145351917
is determined emotionally: "I must reach into myself for the spring    1.6065767145351917
that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event    1.6065767145351917
with which the dance confronts me". Looking back, Miss Marsicano    1.5636360329510388
feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock.    1.67495327387791
At one time she felt impelled to make dances that "moved all    1.6432600607208703
over the stage", much as Pollock's paintings move violently over    1.5636360329510388
the full extent of the canvas. But her conscious need was to break away    1.7026049541338664
from constricting patterns of form, a need to let the experience shape    1.6432600607208703
itself.   Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity    1.4513752902486308
that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement. It    1.6065767145351917
may be a free front-back swing of the leg, leading to a sideways swing    1.7026049541338664
of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off    1.7026049541338664
from the ground. This became a dance called <Prelude to Flight>.    1.6065767145351917
A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close    1.6432600607208703
to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.   1.7026049541338664
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal    1.5636360329510388
emotion. He seeks to make his dancers more "godlike" by relating    1.6065767145351917
them to the impersonal elements of shape, light color, and sound. If    1.6432600607208703
his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures    1.67495327387791
from Mars, this is consistent with his intention of placing them in    1.6432600607208703
the orbit of another world, a world in which they are freed of their    1.7026049541338664
pedestrian identities. It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the    1.5636360329510388
germ of form is discovered. In his recognition of his impersonal self    1.6432600607208703
the dancer moves, and this self, in the "first revealed stroke of    1.6432600607208703
its existence", states the theme from which all else must follow. The    1.6432600607208703
theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve.    1.67495327387791
It may be a reaction to a percussive sound, the following movements    1.6432600607208703
constituting further reactions. It may establish the relation of the    1.5636360329510388
figure of the dancer to light and color, in which case changes in the    1.7026049541338664
light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs. Unconcerned    1.6432600607208703
with the practical function of his actions, the dancer is engrossed    1.6065767145351917
exclusively in their "motional content". Movements unfold freely    1.4513752902486308
because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive.    1.5636360329510388
But the metamorphosis must come first.   Though he is also concerned    1.6065767145351917
with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity, Merce    1.5127085093302464
Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim.    1.6065767145351917
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity, any line of action    1.5636360329510388
related to the concept of cause and effect. He bases his approach    1.6432600607208703
on the belief that anything can follow anything. An order can be chanced    1.67495327387791
rather than chosen, and this approach produces an experience that    1.5636360329510388
is "free and discovered rather than bound and remembered". Thus,    1.5636360329510388
there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance    1.6432600607208703
but in the shape of their continuity as well. Chance, he finds, enables    1.67495327387791
him to create "a world beyond imagination". He cites with pleasure    1.6065767145351917
the comment of a lady, who exclaimed after a concert: "Why,    1.6065767145351917
it's extremely interesting. But I would never have thought of it myself".   1.6432600607208703
The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is    1.5127085093302464
unlike any sequence to be seen in life. At one side of the stage a dancer    1.748515906000203
jumps excitedly; nearby, another sits motionless, while still another    1.5127085093302464
is twirling an umbrella. A man and a girl happen to meet; they    1.67495327387791
look straight at the audience, not at each other. He lifts her, puts    1.67495327387791
her down, and walks off, neither pleased nor disturbed, as if nothing    1.6432600607208703
had happened. If one dancer slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette,    1.67495327387791
sit down, or offer his assailant a fork and spoon. Events occur    1.6432600607208703
without apparent reason. Their consequences are irrelevant- or there    1.5127085093302464
are no consequences at all.   The sequence is determined by    1.5636360329510388
chance, and Mr& Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance    1.6432600607208703
devices. He may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab    1.7026049541338664
bag. The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal    1.67495327387791
organization of the dance but also its spatial design, special    1.5636360329510388
slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be    1.67495327387791
performed. The other variables include the dancer who is to perform    1.6065767145351917
the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance.    1.7026049541338664
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the    1.6432600607208703
movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and the approximate    1.5636360329510388
total duration of the dance. The "approximate" is important, because    1.5636360329510388
even after the order of the work has been established by the chance    1.67495327387791
method, the result is not inviolable. Each performance may be different.    1.6065767145351917
If a work is divided into several large segments, a last-minute    1.6065767145351917
drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for    1.6432600607208703
any particular performance. And any sequence can not only change its    1.6065767145351917
positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.   1.6432600607208703
Mr& Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he    1.5636360329510388
adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can. However, there is always    1.67495327387791
the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible    1.6065767145351917
to execute. Then the choreographer must arbitrate. He must    1.5127085093302464
rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other.    1.6432600607208703
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone    1.7026049541338664
one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation    1.67495327387791
for the leap.   1.0
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH were in greater agreement on sovereignty,    1.6065767145351917
through all their dispute about it, than were the Founding Fathers.    1.6065767145351917
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen    1.5636360329510388
of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun, and defended in the end    1.6432600607208703
by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee. The people everywhere    1.6432600607208703
had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles, in    1.5636360329510388
understanding of and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their    1.67495327387791
Union. Repeated efforts- beginning with the Missouri Compromise    1.4513752902486308
of 1821- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas    1.6432600607208703
to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise, rather than clear    1.5636360329510388
thought and timely action. Even so, confusion in this period gained    1.6065767145351917
such strength (from compromise and other factors) that it led to the    1.6432600607208703
bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century. Nothing can show more than    1.6065767145351917
this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in    1.6432600607208703
even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.   1.5636360329510388
The present issue in Atlantica- whether to transform an    1.5127085093302464
alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens-    1.6065767145351917
resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that    1.6065767145351917
was resolved by Civil War. And so I would only touch upon it now    1.7026049541338664
(much as I have long wanted to write a book about it). I think it is    1.748515906000203
essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts    1.6065767145351917
of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better    1.67495327387791
how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse    1.6432600607208703
confusion on this subject.   The difference came down to this:    1.5636360329510388
The Southern States insisted that the United States was, in last    1.6065767145351917
analysis, what its name implied- a Union of States. To their leaders    1.6432600607208703
the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign    1.6065767145351917
states, who therefore retained the right to secede from it. This right    1.6432600607208703
of the State, its upholders contended, was essential to maintain    1.5636360329510388
the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger    1.67495327387791
of centralizing power in the Union government. The champions of    1.5636360329510388
the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally,    1.5127085093302464
the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign    1.6432600607208703
citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right    1.6432600607208703
to secede, though the citizens could. Writing to Speed on August    1.6065767145351917
24, 1855, Lincoln made the latter point clear. In homely terms whose    1.6432600607208703
timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to secede.    1.6432600607208703
"  We began by declaring that <all men are created equal>.    1.5636360329510388
We now practically read it, <all men are created equal except negroes>.    1.6432600607208703
When the Know-nothings get control, it will read, <All    1.5127085093302464
men    1.0
are created equal except negroes> and foreigners and Catholics. When    1.5636360329510388
it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where    1.6432600607208703
they make no pretence of loving liberty- to Russia, for instance, where    1.6432600607208703
despotism can be taken pure, without the base alloy of hypocrisy".    1.6065767145351917
[His emphasis]   When the Southern States exercised    1.3761581156320553
their "right to secede", they formed what they officially styled "The    1.6065767145351917
Confederate States of America". Dictionaries, as we have    1.4513752902486308
seen, still cite this government, along with the Articles of Confederation    1.6065767145351917
of 1781, as an example of a confederacy. The fact is that the    1.67495327387791
Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as    1.6065767145351917
the Federal Constitution did. The Confederate Constitution copied    1.4513752902486308
much of the Federal Constitution verbatim, and most of the rest in    1.6432600607208703
substance. It operated on, by and for the people individually just as    1.6432600607208703
did the Federal Constitution. It made substantially the same division    1.5636360329510388
of power between the central and state governments, and among the    1.6065767145351917
executive, legislative and judicial branches.    1.1606783668269585
Many believe- and understandably-    1.0
that the great difference between the Constitution of    1.4513752902486308
the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the    1.5636360329510388
former recognized the right of each state to secede. But though each    1.6432600607208703
of its members had asserted this right against the Union, the final    1.6432600607208703
Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11- nearly a month    1.6065767145351917
before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing    1.4513752902486308
a state to secede. Its drafters discussed this vital point but    1.6065767145351917
left it out of their Constitution. Their President, Jefferson Davis,    1.5636360329510388
interpreted their Constitution to mean that it "admits of no coerced    1.6065767145351917
association", but this reremained so doubtful that "there were    1.5127085093302464
frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution".   1.6432600607208703
The Constitution of the Southern "Confederation"    1.2818970554302986
differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects:    1.6432600607208703
It openly, defiantly, recognized slavery- an institution    1.3761581156320553
which the Southerners of 1787, even though they continued it, found so    1.6432600607208703
impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning    1.5636360329510388
the word in the Federal Constitution. They recognized that    1.5127085093302464
slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest, and that    1.67495327387791
to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive    1.6065767145351917
contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in    1.6065767145351917
the Declaration of 1776 that "all men are created equal, that they    1.6432600607208703
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among    1.6065767145351917
them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness **h". The    1.6065767145351917
other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the    1.5636360329510388
President of the Confederacy held office for six (instead of four)    1.6065767145351917
years, and was limited to one term.   These are not, however, differences    1.6432600607208703
in federal structure. The only important differences from that    1.5127085093302464
standpoint, between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles.    1.5127085093302464
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people    1.67495327387791
were acting through their states, whereas the Preamble of 1787-89    1.5636360329510388
expressed, as clearly as language can, the opposite concept, that they    1.6065767145351917
were acting directly as citizens. Here are the two Preambles: _FEDERAL    1.6065767145351917
CONSTITUTION, 1789_ "we the People of the United States,    1.5127085093302464
in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure    1.6065767145351917
domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence, promote the general    1.5636360329510388
Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and    1.5636360329510388
our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United    1.6065767145351917
States of America". _CONFEDERATE CONSTITUTION, 1861_ "We    1.3761581156320553
the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its    1.6065767145351917
sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal    1.6065767145351917
government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure    1.4513752902486308
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking    1.5636360329510388
the favor and the guidance of Almighty God- do ordain and establish    1.6432600607208703
this Constitution for the Confederate States of America".   1.4513752902486308
One is tempted to say that, on the difference between the concepts    1.6432600607208703
of sovereignty in these two preambles, the worst war of the Nineteenth    1.6432600607208703
century was fought. But though the Southern States, when drafting    1.5636360329510388
a constitution to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this    1.5636360329510388
fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede, the fact remained    1.67495327387791
that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept    1.67495327387791
that it was composed primarily of sovereign states. If the Union    1.6065767145351917
conceded this to them, the same right must be conceded to each remaining    1.67495327387791
state whenever it saw fit to secede: This would destroy the federal    1.6432600607208703
balance between it and the states, and in the end sacrifice to    1.6432600607208703
the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained    1.6432600607208703
by their Union.   Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the    1.6432600607208703
issue for the Union a vital one: Whether it was a Union of sovereign    1.7026049541338664
citizens that should continue to live, or an association of sovereign    1.6065767145351917
states that must fall prey either to "anarchy or despotism".   1.5636360329510388
Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always willing to    1.5636360329510388
concede to each "slave state" the right to decide independently whether    1.6065767145351917
to continue or end it. Though his election was interpreted by    1.6065767145351917
many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal    1.6432600607208703
balance in favor of the Union, Lincoln himself proposed no such change    1.6432600607208703
in the rights the Constitution gave the states. After the war began,    1.6432600607208703
he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action    1.6432600607208703
even in the Border States that stayed with the Union. He issued    1.6432600607208703
his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left    1.5636360329510388
him no other way to save the Union. In his Message of December    1.67495327387791
2, 1862, he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which I    1.7026049541338664
would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union: <"In giving    1.5127085093302464
freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free">.   What    1.6065767145351917
Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people    1.6432600607208703
were sovereign in the Union. He fought to the end to preserve it    1.67495327387791
as a "government of the people, by the people, for the people".    1.6432600607208703
The fact that the Americans    1.1606783668269585
who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to    1.6432600607208703
keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis    1.6065767145351917
of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer, and the greater.    1.5636360329510388
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged, in the South as in the North,    1.7026049541338664
as America's true sovereign, in "a new birth of freedom", as    1.6065767145351917
Lincoln promised. But before this came about, 214,938 Americans had    1.5636360329510388
given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights    1.67495327387791
of men and of states.   On their decisive battlefield Lincoln    1.5636360329510388
did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the "brave    1.6432600607208703
men, living and dead, who fought here". He understood that both    1.6065767145351917
sides were at fault, and he reached the height of saying so explicitly    1.67495327387791
in his Second Inaugural.   To my knowledge, Lincoln remains    1.5127085093302464
the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who, while fighting    1.5636360329510388
a fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough to say this    1.7026049541338664
publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human    1.7026049541338664
truth there is some error, and in all our error, some truth. So great    1.7026049541338664
a man could not but understand, too, that the thing that moves men to    1.7026049541338664
sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought, which their    1.6432600607208703
opponents see and attack, but the truth which the latter do not see-    1.67495327387791
any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves    1.67495327387791
defend.   It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day    1.6065767145351917
to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives    1.6432600607208703
in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had    1.67495327387791
delegated to the States and to their Union. They differed in the    1.6432600607208703
balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen-    1.5636360329510388
but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental    1.67495327387791
truth: That individual life, liberty and happiness depend    1.4513752902486308
on a right balance between the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty,    1.67495327387791
in all its aspects, which this involves. The 140,414 Americans    1.5636360329510388
who gave "the last full measure of devotion" to prevent disunion,    1.6065767145351917
preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers    1.5636360329510388
of anarchy, inherent in confederations, which throughout history have    1.5127085093302464
proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign    1.6432600607208703
states, and to the liberties of their people. But the fact that    1.6432600607208703
70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing    1.6432600607208703
concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways.   1.3761581156320553
Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing    1.6432600607208703
the Southerners their right to have slaves- a right that was even    1.6432600607208703
less compatible with the sovereignty of man. The very fact that they    1.6432600607208703
came so near to winning by the wrong method, war, led directly to their    1.7026049541338664
losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for, since it forced    1.7026049541338664
Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure. There was    1.6065767145351917
a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another. There was also a    1.67495327387791
lesson, one that has served ever since to keep Americans, in their conflicts    1.67495327387791
with one another, from turning from the ballot to the bullet.    1.6065767145351917
Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case,    1.6432600607208703
they did not lose the truth they fought for. The lives so many of them    1.7269387314284994
gave, to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment    1.6065767145351917
by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued    1.6432600607208703
ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe.    1.5636360329510388
As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new "unnatural" and    1.5636360329510388
internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with    1.5127085093302464
the entropy-increasing properties of the external world. The useful    1.5127085093302464
suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a    1.5636360329510388
third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with    1.5636360329510388
our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique    1.6432600607208703
for building protective artificial environments. One wonders    1.3761581156320553
about its applicability to people. Will advances in human sciences help    1.6065767145351917
us build social structures and governments which will enable us to    1.6065767145351917
cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein    1.6065767145351917
and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to    1.6432600607208703
adapt to a sea of molecular interaction? The answer is of course yes.    1.67495327387791
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit, composed    1.67495327387791
of people, which gives us both some immunity from, and a way of dealing    1.7026049541338664
with, other people. Social invention did not have to await social    1.6065767145351917
theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier    1.7269387314284994
or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes.    1.6065767145351917
But it has been during the last two centuries, during the scientific    1.6432600607208703
revolution, that our independence from the physical environment has    1.5127085093302464
made the most rapid strides. We have ample light when the sun sets;    1.67495327387791
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly    1.6432600607208703
through the air, although gravity pulls us down; the range of our    1.6432600607208703
voice ignores distance. At what stage are social sciences then? Is    1.6065767145351917
the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time    1.7026049541338664
of Newton? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion    1.5636360329510388
of cause in Copernicus and in Freud. And it is certainly no slight    1.67495327387791
to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.   1.6432600607208703
Political theoretical understanding, although almost at a standstill    1.4513752902486308
during this century, did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth    1.5636360329510388
centuries, and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased    1.5636360329510388
the possibility for man to coexist with man. Consitutional government,    1.5636360329510388
popular vote, trial by jury, public education, labor unions, cooperatives,    1.5636360329510388
communes, socialized ownership, world courts, and the veto    1.4513752902486308
power in world councils are but a few examples. Most of these, with    1.67495327387791
horrible exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an attempt to    1.67495327387791
quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny its force, but as a means to    1.7269387314284994
survive and enjoy it. The most effective political inventions seem to    1.6065767145351917
make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters    1.6432600607208703
can play only a minor part in the whole scheme. Just as present    1.67495327387791
technology had to await the explanations of physics, so one might    1.6065767145351917
expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding.    1.5127085093302464
We are desperately in the need of such invention, for man is    1.6432600607208703
still very much at the mercy of man. In fact the accumulation of the    1.7026049541338664
hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other.    1.67495327387791
I want, therefore, to discuss a second and quite different    1.5636360329510388
fruit of science, the connection between scientific understanding    1.4513752902486308
and fear. There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human    1.6432600607208703
sciences which in themselves and even without political invention    1.5127085093302464
can help to dispel our present fears. Lucretius has remarked: "The    1.6065767145351917
reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all    1.7026049541338664
sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause,    1.67495327387791
and these they attribute to the will of God". Perhaps things    1.6065767145351917
were even worse then. It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears    1.6432600607208703
of man. We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and    1.67495327387791
from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people    1.67495327387791
now than man ever was. We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in    1.7026049541338664
the same way that people once feared comets. The bombs are as harmless    1.67495327387791
as an automobile in a garage. We are worried about what people may    1.67495327387791
do with them- that some crazy fool may "push the button".    1.6065767145351917
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human    1.6432600607208703
fears, but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific    1.6432600607208703
explanations that stand out quite clearly. They are in general    1.5636360329510388
those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual.    1.67495327387791
They include both individual fears and collective ones. They arise    1.5636360329510388
in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not    1.6065767145351917
only on the external world, but also on the precise pattern of behavior    1.67495327387791
of the individual or group. Often it is recognized that all the details    1.67495327387791
of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but, because    1.6432600607208703
the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical    1.5636360329510388
understanding, one is never quite certain which behavior elements    1.5127085093302464
are effective, and the whole pattern becomes ritualized. Yet often    1.5636360329510388
fear persists because, even with the most rigid ritual, one is never    1.6432600607208703
quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or    1.67495327387791
that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive    1.67495327387791
act. To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates    1.6432600607208703
the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much    1.5127085093302464
of magic and superstition. But a somewhat more detailed analysis    1.5636360329510388
of this process may be illuminating.   The frequently postulated    1.5127085093302464
antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness    1.6065767145351917
apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize.    1.6432600607208703
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly    1.6065767145351917
cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people    1.6432600607208703
to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice. This and other    1.6065767145351917
fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually, first, with the    1.6065767145351917
Ptolemaic    1.0
system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then, more    1.5636360329510388
firmly, with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could    1.6065767145351917
account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions.    1.4513752902486308
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one    1.6432600607208703
can eliminate fear without instituting any controls. In fact, although    1.5636360329510388
we have dispelled the fear, we have not necessarily assured ourselves    1.6065767145351917
that there are no dangers. There is still the remote possibility    1.6065767145351917
of planetoid collision. A meteor could fall on San Francisco. Solar    1.6065767145351917
activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought.    1.5636360329510388
Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our    1.6432600607208703
former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which, in this case,    1.6065767145351917
amounts to doing nothing. Yet we no longer feel uneasy. This almost    1.6432600607208703
trivial example is nevertheless suggestive, for there are some elements    1.5636360329510388
in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter    1.6432600607208703
and shorter and our present fear of war. We, in our country, think    1.67495327387791
of war as an external threat which, if it occurs, will not be primarily    1.7026049541338664
of our own doing. And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance    1.67495327387791
of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way    1.6432600607208703
on the details of how we behave. What elements of our behavior are decisive?    1.7026049541338664
Our weapons production, our world prestige, our ideas of democracy,    1.5636360329510388
our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage?    1.5636360329510388
We have staved off a war and, since our behavior has involved all    1.67495327387791
these elements, we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring    1.6432600607208703
to abandon any part of it, since we have not the slightest notion which    1.7026049541338664
parts are effective.   I think that we are here also talking of    1.6432600607208703
the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching    1.7677783654484436
at night along the streets of a large city. If an automobile    1.6432600607208703
were approaching him, he would know what was required of him, even though    1.67495327387791
he might not be able to act quickly enough. With the group of boys    1.7026049541338664
it is different. He does not know whether to look up or look aside,    1.7026049541338664
to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side, to cross    1.748515906000203
the street, or to continue on the same side. When confronted with    1.6432600607208703
a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them    1.748515906000203
might do to me or to himself or to others. I believe that what I do    1.748515906000203
has some effect on his actions and I have learned, in a way, to commune    1.7269387314284994
with drunks, but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly    1.6065767145351917
the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment    1.67495327387791
in physics. I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some    1.6432600607208703
unwitting slip all hell may break loose. Our inability to explain    1.6065767145351917
why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of    1.67495327387791
ritual and malaise. We are forced, in our behavior towards others, to    1.6432600607208703
adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a    1.6065767145351917
minimal understanding of their essential elements.   Our collective    1.4513752902486308
policies, group and national, are similarly based on voodoo, but    1.5636360329510388
here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still    1.6432600607208703
engaged in determing them. We use terms from our personal experience    1.6065767145351917
with individuals such as "trust", "cheat", and "get tough".    1.5127085093302464
We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus    1.6065767145351917
talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles. We    1.6432600607208703
perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually    1.4513752902486308
no understanding of social cause and effect. Small wonder, then,    1.5636360329510388
that we fear.   The achievements which dispelled our fears of    1.5636360329510388
the cosmos took place three centuries ago. What additional roles has    1.6065767145351917
the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played?    1.5636360329510388
In the physical sciences, these achievements concern electricity, chemistry,    1.5127085093302464
and atomic physics. In the life sciences, there has been an    1.6065767145351917
enormous increase in our understanding of disease, in the mechanisms of    1.6065767145351917
heredity, and in bio- and physiological chemistry. The major effect    1.5636360329510388
of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the    1.7026049541338664
industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding    1.5127085093302464
has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment. In    1.6432600607208703
addition, our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also    1.6065767145351917
changed. Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding    1.5127085093302464
is still lacking, but where some explanations are possible, as with    1.6065767145351917
lightning and weather and earthquakes, the appropriate kind of human action    1.6065767145351917
has been more adequately indicated.   Apparently the population    1.4513752902486308
as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations    1.5636360329510388
of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears. How and    1.6432600607208703
why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject    1.5636360329510388
for study. In some areas, the progress is slower than in others. In    1.67495327387791
agriculture, for example, despite the advances in biology, elaborate    1.5127085093302464
rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence    1.6432600607208703
of some natural disaster. In child care, the opposite extreme prevails;    1.6065767145351917
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds    1.4513752902486308
anything warranted by established psychological theory. There are    1.4513752902486308
many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite    1.6065767145351917
appropriate reduction in ritual and fear. Much of the former extreme    1.6065767145351917
uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death    1.5127085093302464
has disappeared. The persistent horror of having a malformed child    1.5636360329510388
has, I believe, been reduced, not because we have gained any control    1.6432600607208703
over this misfortune, but precisely because we have learned that we    1.6065767145351917
have so little control over it. In fact, the recent warnings about the    1.67495327387791
use of ~X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which    1.6065767145351917
now require more detailed understanding, and thus in this instance,    1.5636360329510388
science has momentarily aggravated our fears. In fact, insofar as    1.5636360329510388
science generates any fear, it stems not so much from scientific prowess    1.6432600607208703
and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise,    1.6065767145351917
which, until they are understood, create uncertainty.   Perhaps    1.4513752902486308
the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding    1.6065767145351917
is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease.    1.6065767145351917
The situation with regard to our attitude and "control" of disease    1.6065767145351917
contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect    1.5127085093302464
to people. The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear    1.7026049541338664
I have tried to describe.    1.1606783668269585
Nothing like Godot, he arrived before the hour. His letter had    1.6065767145351917
suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday, and I came into    1.7026049541338664
the lobby as the clock struck twelve. He was waiting.   My wish    1.6432600607208703
to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest    1.6432600607208703
in his work. American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays    1.6065767145351917
nihilistic. They find deep pessimism in them. Even so astute a commentator    1.6432600607208703
as Harold Clurman of <The Nation> has said that "Waiting    1.5636360329510388
for Godot" is "the concentrate **h of the contemporary European    1.5636360329510388
**h mood of despair". But to me Beckett's writing had seemed    1.6065767145351917
permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that    1.67495327387791
I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism. Could it    1.6065767145351917
be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me? Is his a literature of    1.7269387314284994
defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face? Or is it relevant    1.6432600607208703
because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?   1.5636360329510388
I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such    1.6432600607208703
questions, because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last    1.7026049541338664
analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself. Nevertheless    1.6432600607208703
I was curious.   My curiosity was sharpened a day or two    1.6065767145351917
before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher    1.6432600607208703
of literature, a Jesuit father, at a conference on religious    1.5636360329510388
drama near Paris. When Beckett's name came into the discussion,    1.5636360329510388
the priest    1.0
grew loud and told me that Beckett "hates life". That,    1.5636360329510388
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish. The features of his face    1.5636360329510388
are distinct, but not fine. They look as if they had been sculptured    1.67495327387791
with an unsharpened chisel. Unruly hair goes straight up from his    1.6065767145351917
forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show    1.7026049541338664
that it really is hair and not bristle. One might say it combines    1.67495327387791
the man; own pride and humility. For he has the pride that comes of    1.7026049541338664
self-acceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to    1.6065767145351917
impose himself upon another. His light blue eyes, set deep within the    1.6432600607208703
face, are actively and continually looking. He seems, by some unconscious    1.6065767145351917
division of labor, to have given them that one function and no    1.6432600607208703
other, leaving communication to the rest of the face. The mouth frequently    1.6432600607208703
breaks into a disarming smile. The voice is light in timbre, with    1.6432600607208703
a rough edge that corresponds to his visage. The Irish accent is,    1.6432600607208703
as one would expect, combined with slight inflections from the French.    1.6065767145351917
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green. He wore a brown knit    1.7026049541338664
sports shirt with no tie.   We walked down the Rue de L'Arcade,    1.6432600607208703
thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe    1.6065767145351917
opposite that church. The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing    1.6065767145351917
but it could hardly be called world-shattering. For one thing,    1.5636360329510388
the world that Beckett sees is already shattered. His talk turns to    1.6432600607208703
what he calls "the mess", or sometimes "this buzzing confusion".    1.5636360329510388
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our    1.5636360329510388
conversation. What appears here is shorter than what he actually said    1.6065767145351917
but very close to his own words.   "The confusion is not my    1.6432600607208703
invention. We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without    1.6065767145351917
being acutely aware of the confusion. It is all around us and our    1.67495327387791
only chance now is to let it in. The only chance of renovation is to    1.7269387314284994
open our eyes and see the mess. It is not a mess you can make sense of".   1.7677783654484436
I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth,    1.67495327387791
but Beckett did not take to the word truth.   "What is more    1.6432600607208703
true than anything else? To swim is true, and to sink is true.    1.67495327387791
One is not more true than the other. One cannot speak anymore of being,    1.7026049541338664
one must speak only of the mess. When Heidegger and Sartre speak    1.6432600607208703
of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't    1.67495327387791
know, but their language is too philosophical for me. I am not a    1.67495327387791
philosopher. One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that    1.7026049541338664
now is simply the mess".   Then he began to speak about the tension    1.67495327387791
in art between the mess and form. Until recently, art has withstood    1.6432600607208703
the pressure of chaotic things. It has held them at bay. It realized    1.67495327387791
that to admit them was to jeopardize form. "How could the mess    1.6432600607208703
be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and    1.67495327387791
therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be"?    1.6432600607208703
But now we can keep it out no longer, because we have come into a    1.7269387314284994
time when "it invades our experience at every moment. It is there    1.6432600607208703
and it must be allowed in".   I granted this might be so, but    1.67495327387791
found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.    1.7269387314284994
And why not? How, I asked, could chaos be admitted to    1.6065767145351917
chaos? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art?    1.7026049541338664
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form. Beckett's    1.67495327387791
own work is an example. Plays more highly formalized than "Waiting    1.6065767145351917
for Godot", "Endgame", and "Krapp's Last Tape" would    1.4513752902486308
be hard to find.   "What I am saying does not mean that there    1.67495327387791
will henceforth be no form in art. It only means that there will    1.67495327387791
be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits    1.748515906000203
the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something    1.7026049541338664
else. The form and the chaos remain separate. The latter is not reduced    1.67495327387791
to the former. That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation,    1.6432600607208703
because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates.    1.6432600607208703
To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of    1.67495327387791
the artist now".   Yet, I responded, could not similar things    1.5636360329510388
be said about the art of the past? Is it not characteristic of the    1.7026049541338664
greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify,    1.6065767145351917
demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable    1.6065767145351917
way? What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting    1.67495327387791
to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow    1.67495327387791
themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic    1.6432600607208703
theory? Isn't all art ambiguous?   "Not this", he said,    1.5127085093302464
and gestured toward the Madeleine. The classical lines of the church    1.6065767145351917
which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory, dominated all    1.6065767145351917
the scene where we sat. The Boulevard de la Madeleine, the Boulevard    1.6432600607208703
Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery,    1.6065767145351917
bearing tidings of the Age of Reason. "Not this. This is clear.    1.6432600607208703
This does not allow the mystery to invade us. With classical art,    1.6432600607208703
all is settled. But it is different at Chartres. There is the unexplainable,    1.67495327387791
and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to    1.6065767145351917
answer".   I asked about the battle between life and death in    1.6065767145351917
his plays. Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide; Hamm's    1.6432600607208703
world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living    1.7677783654484436
child outside. Is this life-death question a part of the chaos?   1.6065767145351917
"Yes. If life and death did not both present themselves to    1.6065767145351917
us, there would be no inscrutability. If there were only darkness, all    1.6432600607208703
would be clear. It is because there is not only darkness but also    1.67495327387791
light that our situation becomes inexplicable. Take Augustine's doctrine    1.5127085093302464
of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic    1.6065767145351917
qualities in this theology? Two thieves are crucified with Christ,    1.5636360329510388
one saved and the other damned. How can we make sense of this    1.67495327387791
division? In classical drama, such problems do not arise. The destiny    1.6065767145351917
of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed    1.6065767145351917
into the dark. As she goes, she herself will be illuminated. At    1.6432600607208703
the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end    1.67495327387791
she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that    1.6432600607208703
she moves toward the dark. That is the play. Within this notion clarity    1.67495327387791
is possible, but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there    1.6432600607208703
is not such clarity. The question would also be removed if we believed    1.67495327387791
in the contrary- total salvation. But where we have both dark    1.6065767145351917
and light we have also the inexplicable. The key word in my plays is    1.7026049541338664
Given a theological lead, I asked what he    1.4513752902486308
thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.   1.6065767145351917
"Well, really there is none at all. I have no religious feeling.    1.6432600607208703
Once I had a religious emotion. It was at my first Communion.    1.6432600607208703
No more. My mother was deeply religious. So was my brother. He knelt    1.67495327387791
down at his bed as long as he could kneel. My father had none. The    1.7269387314284994
family was Protestant, but for me it was only irksome and I let it    1.7026049541338664
go. My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they    1.67495327387791
died. At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school    1.7026049541338664
tie. Irish Catholicism is not attractive, but it is deeper. When    1.6065767145351917
you pass a church on an Irish bus, all the hands flurry in the sign of    1.748515906000203
the cross. One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps    1.7026049541338664
also the pigs".   But do the plays deal with the same facets    1.6432600607208703
of experience religion must also deal with?   "Yes, for they    1.5636360329510388
deal with distress. Some people object to this in my writing. At a    1.67495327387791
party an English intellectual- so-called- asked me why I write    1.5636360329510388
always about distress. As if it were perverse to do so! He wanted    1.67495327387791
to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home    1.748515906000203
to give me an unhappy childhood. I told him no, that I had had a very    1.748515906000203
happy childhood. Then he thought me more perverse than ever. I left    1.6432600607208703
the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi. On the glass partition    1.7269387314284994
between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help    1.6432600607208703
for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for    1.67495327387791
the war refugees. One does not have to look for distress. It is screaming    1.7026049541338664
at you even in the taxis of London".   Lunch was over,    1.6065767145351917
and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming    1.7269387314284994
The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar    1.4513752902486308
to qualities I had found in the plays. He says nothing that compresses    1.67495327387791
experience within a closed pattern. "Perhaps" stands in    1.4513752902486308
place of commitment. At the same time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly    1.6432600607208703
friendly. If there were only the mess, all would be clear; but    1.6432600607208703
there is also compassion.   As a Christian, I know I do not    1.6432600607208703
stand where Beckett stands, but I do see much of what he sees. As a    1.7269387314284994
writer on the theater, I have paid close attention to the plays. Harold    1.67495327387791
Clurman is right to say that "Waiting for Godot" is a reflection    1.6432600607208703
(he calls it a distorted reflection) "of the impasse and disarray    1.6065767145351917
of Europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life".    1.5636360329510388
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to. "Waiting for Godot"    1.67495327387791
sells even better in America than in France. The consciousness    1.5636360329510388
it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America, but it    1.67495327387791
is the consciousness that most "mature" societies arrive at when    1.5636360329510388
their successes in technological and economic systematization propel    1.4513752902486308
them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture.    1.6065767145351917
America is now joining Europe in this "mature" phase of development.    1.6065767145351917
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens    1.67495327387791
as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going    1.6065767145351917
on in the countries of Asia and Africa, and also of course on how long    1.7269387314284994
the cold war remains cold.    1.1606783668269585
Even Hemingway, for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality    1.6065767145351917
in <The Sun Also Rises> and <A Farewell to Arms> never    1.6065767145351917
maintained that sex was all. Hemingway's fiction is supported by a    1.6065767145351917
"moral" backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at    1.6065767145351917
a religious dimension. And D& H& Lawrence, in <Fantasia of the    1.6065767145351917
Unconscious,> protested vehemently against the overestimation of    1.3761581156320553
the sexual motive. Though sex in some form or other enters into all human    1.7026049541338664
activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect    1.6432600607208703
of human nature, it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of    1.6432600607208703
sex. "All is <not> sex", declared Lawrence. Man is not confined    1.6065767145351917
to one outlet for his vital energy. The creative urge, for example,    1.6432600607208703
transcends the body and the self.   But for the beat generation    1.6065767145351917
all <is> sex. Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary    1.7026049541338664
aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex. For    1.5636360329510388
the beatnik, like the hipster, is in opposition to a society that is based    1.7026049541338664
on the repression of the sex instinct. He has elevated sex- not    1.6432600607208703
Eros or libido but pure, spontaneous, uninhibited sex- to the rank    1.6065767145351917
of the godhead; it is Astarte, Ishtar, Venus, Yahwe, Dionysus,    1.5636360329510388
Christ, the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the    1.5636360329510388
body of the universe. Jazz is sex, marijuana is a stimulus to sex, the    1.7026049541338664
beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse.    1.6432600607208703
Lawrence Lipton, in <The Holy Barbarians,> stresses that for    1.5127085093302464
the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it is a    1.7026049541338664
mystique, and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities    1.6065767145351917
of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe    1.6065767145351917
of discourse. The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against    1.5636360329510388
the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in    1.6432600607208703
a public place. The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression    1.67495327387791
of ungratified sexual desire. For this reason, too, their language    1.5636360329510388
is more forthright and earthy. The beatniks crave a sexual experience    1.6065767145351917
in which their whole being participates.   It is therefore not    1.5636360329510388
surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity,    1.67495327387791
for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy.    1.6432600607208703
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy    1.6432600607208703
the precepts of legalized propriety. Unlike the heroes and flappers    1.5636360329510388
of the lost generation, they disdain the art of "necking" and "petting".    1.6432600607208703
That is reserved for the squares. If they avoid the use    1.6065767145351917
of the pungent, outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo;    1.6432600607208703
it is sacred. As Lipton, the prophet of the beat generation, declares:    1.6432600607208703
"In the sexual act, the beat are filled with mana, the divine    1.6432600607208703
power. This is far from the vulgar, leering sexuality of the middle-class    1.6432600607208703
square in heat". This is the Holy Grail these knights of    1.6065767145351917
the orgasm pursue, this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they    1.6432600607208703
respond.   If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out    1.6432600607208703
of the Egypt of sexual slavery, Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers    1.67495327387791
them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence    1.5127085093302464
in liquor, marijuana, sex, and jazz. In addition, they have been converted    1.6432600607208703
to Zen Buddhism, with its glorification of all that is "natural"    1.6065767145351917
and mysteriously alive, the sense that everything in the world    1.5636360329510388
is flowing. Thus, paradoxically, the beat writers resort to "religious"    1.5636360329510388
metaphors: they are in search of mana, the spiritual, the numinous,    1.6065767145351917
but not anything connected with formal religion. What they are    1.5636360329510388
after is the beatific vision. And Zen Buddhism, though it is extremely    1.6432600607208703
difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled,    1.5127085093302464
helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through    1.5636360329510388
sexual release.   The style of life chosen by the beat generation,    1.6065767145351917
the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own,    1.6065767145351917
is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience. Jazz is    1.6432600607208703
good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided    1.6432600607208703
sexual effect. Jazz is the musical language of sex, the vocabulary of    1.6432600607208703
the orgasm; indeed, it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz,    1.6432600607208703
by freeing the listener of his inhibitions, can have therapeutic    1.5636360329510388
value. That is why, the argument runs, the squares are so fearful of    1.67495327387791
jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it. Instead of giving themselves    1.6065767145351917
spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them, they    1.6065767145351917
undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes    1.5636360329510388
for satisfaction. Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy, the    1.5636360329510388
sacred road to integration of being. Jazz, like sex, is a mystique. It    1.67495327387791
is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative    1.67495327387791
impulse in unfettered man.   The mystique of sex, combined with    1.5636360329510388
marijuana and jazz, is intended to provide a design for living. Those    1.6432600607208703
who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free, their    1.6065767145351917
instincts put at the service of the imagination. Righteous in their    1.6065767145351917
denunciation of all that makes for death, the beat prophets bid all    1.6432600607208703
men become cool cats; let them learn to "swing" freely, to let    1.6432600607208703
go, to become authentically themselves, and then perhaps civilization    1.5127085093302464
will be saved. The beatnik, seceding from a society that is fatally    1.6432600607208703
afflicted with a deathward drive, is concerned with his personal salvation    1.6065767145351917
in the living present. If he is the child of nothingness, if he    1.67495327387791
is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars, then he will consult    1.7026049541338664
only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil. He will not    1.7026049541338664
curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that    1.6065767145351917
makes him feel truly and fully alive, even if it is only for this brief    1.7269387314284994
moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.   1.5127085093302464
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the    1.6432600607208703
title of the holy barbarians; they will destroy the shrines, temples,    1.6065767145351917
museums, and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the    1.67495327387791
life they believe in. Apart from the categorical imperative they derive    1.6065767145351917
from the metaphysics of the orgasm, the only affirmation they are    1.6065767145351917
capable of making is that art is their only refuge. Their writing,    1.6432600607208703
born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality, reflects    1.5636360329510388
the extremity of their existential alienation. The mind has betrayed    1.5636360329510388
them, reason is the foe of life; they will trust only their physical    1.67495327387791
sensations, the wisdom of the body, the holy promptings of the unconscious.    1.6432600607208703
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate, but their    1.5636360329510388
faith in love, inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz, culminates    1.6065767145351917
in the climax of the orgasm. Their work mirrors the mentality    1.6065767145351917
of the psychopath, rootless and irresponsible. Their rebellion against    1.5127085093302464
authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt    1.6065767145351917
characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.   And the life they    1.5127085093302464
lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive, even though    1.6065767145351917
they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit-    1.6065767145351917
writing, painting, music. They are non-conformists on principle. When    1.5127085093302464
they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth,    1.5636360329510388
the rage of repudiation, the ecstasy of negation. It is sex that obsesses    1.67495327387791
them, sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed. What    1.6432600607208703
they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can    1.6432600607208703
inspire the Muse. Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful    1.6432600607208703
middle class continue to suffer, whereas the beatnik has the courage    1.6065767145351917
to break out of that prison of respectability. One girl describes    1.6065767145351917
her past, her succession of broken marriages, the abortions she has    1.6065767145351917
had    1.0
and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she    1.67495327387791
must justify her passion. If it is an honest feeling, then why should    1.67495327387791
she not yield to it? "<Most> often", she says, "it's the    1.6065767145351917
<monogamous> relationship that is <dis>honest". There is nothing    1.4513752902486308
holy in wedlock. This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist    1.5636360329510388
who disapproves of her life. She finds married life stifling and every    1.6432600607208703
prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.   This confession    1.3761581156320553
serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution:    1.6432600607208703
the craving for sensation for its own sake, the need for change,    1.6432600607208703
for new experiences. Boredom is death. In the realm of physical sensations,    1.6432600607208703
sex reigns supreme. Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on    1.5127085093302464
marijuana, jazz, free swinging poetry, exhausting themselves in orgies    1.5127085093302464
of sex; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and    1.67495327387791
lose contact with reality. One beat poet composes a poem, "Lines on    1.6432600607208703
a Tijuana John", which contains a few happy hints for survival.    1.6065767145351917
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must    1.7269387314284994
move toward simplicity. The professed mission of this disaffiliated    1.5127085093302464
generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry    1.7269387314284994
and fiction, but what they produce is unfortunately disordered, nourished    1.5636360329510388
solely on the hysteria of negation.   Who are the creative    1.5636360329510388
representatives of this movement? Nymphomaniacs, junkies, homosexuals,    1.3761581156320553
drug addicts, lesbians, alcoholics, the weak, the frustrated,    1.4513752902486308
the irresolute, the despairing, the derelicts and outcasts of society.    1.5636360329510388
They embrace independent poverty, usually with a "shack-up" partner    1.5127085093302464
who will help support them. They are full of contempt for the institution    1.67495327387791
of matrimony. Their previous legalized marriages do not count,    1.5127085093302464
for they hold the laws of the state null and void. They feel they    1.7026049541338664
are leagued against a hostile, persecutory world, faced with the concerted    1.6065767145351917
malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings, the police.    1.5127085093302464
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending    1.6065767145351917
their way of life, their search for wholeness, though their actual existence    1.6432600607208703
fails to reach these "religious" heights. One beatnik got    1.5127085093302464
the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and    1.67495327387791
all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up. What    1.6432600607208703
obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk? Sex    1.6432600607208703
as the creative principle of the universe, the secret of primitive religion,    1.6432600607208703
the life of myth. Everything in the final analysis reduced itself    1.6065767145351917
to sexual symbolism. In his chapter on "The Loveways of the    1.6065767145351917
Beat Generation", Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details.    1.6065767145351917
No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West    1.67495327387791
Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the    1.6432600607208703
group.   The women who come to West Venice, having forsaken radicalism,    1.6065767145351917
are interested in living only for the moment, in being constantly    1.6065767145351917
on the move. Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat    1.67495327387791
generation are homosexuals, heroin addicts, and smalltime hoodlums.    1.4513752902486308
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks.    1.6432600607208703
Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana, they do not have to be    1.6432600607208703
initiated. Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana. As Lipton    1.7026049541338664
puts it: "The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana    1.6432600607208703
with far greater force, as a unifying principle in human relationships,    1.6065767145351917
than at any other time except, perhaps, in the mutual metaphysical    1.6065767145351917
orgasms. The magic circle is, in fact, a symbol of and preparation for    1.67495327387791
the metaphysical orgasm". Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik    1.5636360329510388
comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense    1.5127085093302464
of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being.    1.7269387314284994
Carried high on this "charge", he composes "magical" poetry    1.5127085093302464
that captures the organic rhythms of life in words. If he thus achieves    1.67495327387791
a lyrical, dreamlike, drugged intensity, he pays the price for his    1.6065767145351917
indulgence by producing work- Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" is    1.4513752902486308
a striking example of this tendency- that is disoriented, Dionysian    1.5636360329510388
but without depth and without Apollonian control. For drugs are in    1.6065767145351917
themselves no royal road to creativity. How is the beat poet to achieve    1.67495327387791
unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic    1.7026049541338664
derangement of senses.   If love reflects the nature of man, as    1.6065767145351917
Ortega y Gasset believes, if the person in love betrays decisively what    1.6432600607208703
he is by his behavior in love, then the writers of the beat generation    1.7026049541338664
are creating a new literary genre.    1.2818970554302986
_@_ There were fences in the old days when we were children. Across    1.6432600607208703
the front of a yard and down the side, they were iron, either spiked    1.7026049541338664
along the top or arched in half circles. Alley fences were made    1.6432600607208703
of solid boards higher than one's head, but not so high as the golden    1.7026049541338664
glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them.    1.7026049541338664
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses; front    1.5636360329510388
fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle.    1.6065767145351917
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of    1.5636360329510388
cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail:    1.6065767145351917
high-pitched roof, pinnacle, and narrow gable. On these posts    1.5127085093302464
the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang.   1.67495327387791
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences    1.6432600607208703
was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree. The primary    1.67495327387791
quality of that view seems, now, to have been its quietness, but that    1.67495327387791
cannot at the time have impressed us. What one actually remembers    1.6065767145351917
is its greenness. From high in the tree, the whole block lay within    1.67495327387791
range of the eye, but the ground was almost nowhere visible. One looked    1.67495327387791
down on a sea of leaves, a breaking wave of flower. Every path from    1.7026049541338664
back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor, and every yard had its    1.7026049541338664
fruit trees. In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers    1.6432600607208703
had planted syringa and sweet-shrub, snowball, rose-of-Sharon and    1.4513752902486308
balm-of-Gilead. From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse    1.5636360329510388
of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's gingham    1.6432600607208703
skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor,    1.67495327387791
or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter    1.6065767145351917
of garments hung there, half-way down the block.   That was one    1.6065767145351917
epoch: the apple-tree epoch. Another had ended before it began. Time    1.6065767145351917
is a queer thing and memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays    1.67495327387791
with memory and memory with time are queerest of all. From maturity    1.6432600607208703
one looks back at the succession of years, counts them and makes them    1.67495327387791
many, yet cannot feel <length> in the number, however large. In a    1.6432600607208703
stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond    1.67495327387791
is quiet, its surface dark and shadowed, and there does not seem to    1.67495327387791
be much water in it. Time in the sum is nothing. And yet- a year to    1.748515906000203
a child is an eternity, and in the memory that phase of one's being-    1.7026049541338664
a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning    1.6065767145351917
and without end. The part of the mind that preserves dates and    1.6432600607208703
events may remonstrate, "It could have been like that for only a    1.6432600607208703
little while"; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds    1.6432600607208703
fast to things that were and they are outside of time.   Once,    1.6432600607208703
then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was    1.7026049541338664
bound round by fences, when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough,    1.7269387314284994
to twist my knee over it and pull myself up. That world was in    1.7026049541338664
scale with my own smallness. I have no picture in my mind of the garden    1.7269387314284994
as a whole- that I could not see- but certain aspects of certain    1.67495327387791
corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums    1.5127085093302464
beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their    1.5636360329510388
sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned    1.67495327387791
over by a dusty-slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked    1.5636360329510388
in the ragged, brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner    1.5636360329510388
between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on    1.6432600607208703
our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother    1.7677783654484436
for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.   It was    1.5636360329510388
mother who planted the verbenas. I think that my grandmother was not    1.6432600607208703
an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and    1.6432600607208703
grandchildren. My great-grandmother, I have been told, made her garden    1.5636360329510388
her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders    1.6065767145351917
in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to    1.6432600607208703
be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with    1.7026049541338664
common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed,    1.6432600607208703
and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house. These my    1.67495327387791
grandmother left in their places (they are still there, more persistent    1.6065767145351917
and longer-lived than the generations of man) and planted others like    1.6065767145351917
them, that flourished without careful tending. Three of these only    1.5636360329510388
were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses, whose petals    1.6065767145351917
might not be collected until they had fallen, to be made into perfume    1.67495327387791
or rose-tea to drink; the peonies, whose tight sticky buds would    1.6065767145351917
be blighted by the laying on of a finger, although they were not apparently    1.7026049541338664
harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies. I    1.6432600607208703
have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer    1.67495327387791
morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than    1.6065767145351917
my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap, unfolded, and shook out    1.67495327387791
like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals. Other flowers    1.6432600607208703
we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath    1.6432600607208703
the lilacs; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so prodigally but    1.5636360329510388
for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms    1.5636360329510388
that,    1.0
turned upside down, make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little,    1.5127085093302464
dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.   More    1.5127085093302464
potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a    1.7269387314284994
few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae    1.7026049541338664
which are of the very stuff of the mind, intrinsic, because they    1.6432600607208703
were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that    1.7269387314284994
held them. Flowers, stones, and small creatures, living and dead. Pale    1.6065767145351917
yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods    1.6065767145351917
of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow    1.6065767145351917
columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and    1.4513752902486308
eaten    1.0
for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped    1.6432600607208703
and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers    1.6432600607208703
from the trumpet vine that made "gloves" on the ends of ten    1.6432600607208703
waggling fingers. Fuzzy caterpillars, snails with their sensitive horns,    1.5127085093302464
struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded    1.5636360329510388
to "spit tobacco, spit". Dead fledgling birds, their squashed-looking    1.5127085093302464
nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they    1.67495327387791
had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags. And    1.67495327387791
the    1.0
cast shell of a locust, straw-colored and transparent, weighing nothing,    1.5636360329510388
fragile but entire, with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down    1.6432600607208703
its back. Every morning early, in the summer, we searched the trunks    1.6432600607208703
of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells, carefully    1.7026049541338664
detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung, and stabled    1.6432600607208703
them, a weird faery herd, in an angle between the high roots of the    1.7026049541338664
tulip tree, where no grass grew in the dense shade **h. We collected    1.67495327387791
"lucky stones"- all the creamy translucent pebbles, worn smooth    1.5127085093302464
and round, that we could find in the driveway. When these had been    1.67495327387791
pocketed, we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles    1.6065767145351917
for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their    1.67495327387791
dull exteriors indicated. We showed them to each other and said "Would    1.6432600607208703
you have guessed **h"? Squatting on our haunches beside the    1.5636360329510388
flat stone we broke them on, we were safe behind the high closed gates    1.7026049541338664
at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation    1.6432600607208703
and possible amusement of the passers-by. Thus shielded, we played    1.5636360329510388
many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the    1.5127085093302464
fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post    1.6065767145351917
was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let    1.5636360329510388
down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire, even then we paid    1.67495327387791
little heed to those who went by on the path outside.   We enjoyed    1.67495327387791
a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school. In    1.6432600607208703
the heat of the summer, the garden solitudes were ours alone; our    1.6432600607208703
elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch. They    1.7026049541338664
never troubled themselves about us while we were playing, because    1.5636360329510388
the fence formed such a definite boundary and "Don't go outside    1.6065767145351917
the gate" was a command so impossible of misinterpretation. We were    1.6065767145351917
not, however, entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street.    1.6065767145351917
We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they sag on their    1.67495327387791
hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but we could stand on them, when they    1.67495327387791
were latched, rest our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing    1.67495327387791
to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that lay before    1.5636360329510388
our eyes.   The street that is full now of traffic and parked    1.6432600607208703
cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade    1.7026049541338664
of the curbside trees, and silence was a weight, almost palpable,    1.6065767145351917
in the air. Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell    1.6432600607208703
away again, crushed beneath it. A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter,    1.6432600607208703
the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees, and loose    1.7269387314284994
straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves. A wheel squeaked    1.6065767145351917
on a hub, was still, and squeaked again. If a child watched its progress    1.7026049541338664
he whispered, "Hay, hay, load of hay- make a wish and turn    1.6432600607208703
away", and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the    1.6065767145351917
sound of the horses' feet returned no more. When the hay wagon had    1.67495327387791
gone, and an interval passed, a huckster's cart might turn the corner.    1.6432600607208703
The horse walked, the reins were slack, the huckster rode with bowed    1.6432600607208703
shoulders, his forearms across his knees. Sleepily, as if half-reluctant    1.5636360329510388
to break the silence, he lifted his voice: "Rhu-beb-ni-ice    1.5127085093302464
fresh rhu-<beb> today"! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time    1.5636360329510388
like the drone of a bumble-bee. No one seemed to hear him, no one heeded.    1.7269387314284994
The horse plodded on, and he repeated his call. It became so monotonous    1.67495327387791
as to seem a part of the quietness. After his passage, the street    1.67495327387791
was empty again. The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down;    1.6432600607208703
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk, from sidewalk    1.5636360329510388
to lawn. At four-o'clock, or four-thirty, the coming of the newsboy    1.6065767145351917
marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front    1.67495327387791
door, and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read    1.7026049541338664
what their neighbors had been doing.   The streets of any county    1.6065767145351917
town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were    1.6432600607208703
like this fifty-odd years ago, and yesterday. But the fences were still    1.6432600607208703
in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we stood on the gate to look    1.7026049541338664
over, the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving    1.7026049541338664
stones with grass between and on both sides. The curb was a line    1.67495327387791
of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost    1.7269387314284994
in the ground or the roots of trees. Opposite every gate was a hitching    1.7026049541338664
post or a stone carriage-step, set with a rusty iron ring for tying    1.67495327387791
a horse. The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center;    1.6432600607208703
it was mud in wet weather and dust, ankle-deep, in dry, and could    1.67495327387791
be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones. It had    1.67495327387791
a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since. The hoofmarks of    1.6432600607208703
cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as    1.748515906000203
numerous as the traces of shod horses. Cows were kept in backyard barns,    1.67495327387791
boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge    1.7026049541338664
of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys'    1.67495327387791
coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.   1.7026049541338664
It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story,    1.67495327387791
because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and    1.5636360329510388
makes of them a curious, riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant    1.6065767145351917
for Mann's work.   The wife, Amra, and her lover are    1.5636360329510388
both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, "voluptuous"    1.4513752902486308
and "indolent", possibly "a mischief maker", with "a kind    1.5127085093302464
of luxurious cunning" to set against her apparent simplicity, her "birdlike    1.6065767145351917
brain". La^utner, for his part, "belonged to the present-day    1.5127085093302464
race of small artists, who do not demand the utmost of themselves",    1.6432600607208703
and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets    1.5636360329510388
as "wretched little poseurs", the devastating indictment "they    1.4513752902486308
do not know how to be wretched decently and in order", and the somewhat    1.7026049541338664
extreme prophecy, so far not fulfilled: "They will be destroyed".   1.5636360329510388
The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want    1.5636360329510388
not simply of decency but of imagination as well. His appearance as    1.6432600607208703
Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle    1.67495327387791
absolutely painful, an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed    1.5127085093302464
by spirit, untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation.    1.6065767145351917
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat    1.5636360329510388
man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches    1.7026049541338664
for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's,    1.67495327387791
upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human    1.6065767145351917
life.   The music which La^utner has composed for this episode    1.5636360329510388
is for the most part "rather pretty and perfectly banal". But    1.6065767145351917
it is characteristic of him, we are told, "his little artifice",    1.6065767145351917
to be able to introduce "into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of    1.67495327387791
hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art". And this occurs    1.6065767145351917
now, at the refrain of Jacoby's song- at the point, in fact, of    1.67495327387791
the name "Lizzy"-; a modulation described as "almost a stroke    1.5636360329510388
of genius". "A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly    1.6432600607208703
torn away to reveal something nude". It is this modulation    1.5636360329510388
which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously,    1.5636360329510388
his wife's infidelity. By the same means he perceives this fact    1.6065767145351917
as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses, and dies.   1.6065767145351917
In the work of every artist, I suppose, there may be found    1.6432600607208703
one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive,    1.6065767145351917
ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly    1.6065767145351917
so for being mysterious, as though some deeply hidden constatation of    1.6065767145351917
thoughts were enciphered in a single image, a single moment. So here.    1.6432600607208703
The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke    1.5636360329510388
gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore    1.7026049541338664
dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the    1.6432600607208703
bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent,    1.5636360329510388
mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional    1.5636360329510388
touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack    1.6065767145351917
the problem of suffering"); the miraculous way in which music, revelation    1.6065767145351917
and death are associated in a single instant- all this seems    1.6065767145351917
a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself,    1.6432600607208703
also,    1.0
it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's    1.6432600607208703
work.   When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that    1.6432600607208703
this passage is of critical significance, I come up with the following    1.6432600607208703
ideas, which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in    1.6432600607208703
a later essay.   Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's    1.6432600607208703
heroes. The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically    1.4513752902486308
turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled    1.5636360329510388
and forbidden to love. The release, the freedom, involved in loving    1.6065767145351917
another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible;    1.5127085093302464
and the motion toward it brings disaster.   This prohibition    1.5127085093302464
on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly    1.6432600607208703
the artist (Tonio Kro^ger, Aschenbach, Leverku^hn) who suffers    1.4513752902486308
from it. The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem    1.67495327387791
of the "breakthrough" in the realm of art.   Again, the sufferings    1.6065767145351917
and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment    1.5127085093302464
not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another    1.6432600607208703
with childhood, with the figure of a child.   Finally, the    1.5636360329510388
theatrical (and perversely erotic) notions of dressing up, cosmetics,    1.5127085093302464
disguise, and especially change of costume (or singularity of costume,    1.5636360329510388
as with Cipolla), are characteristically associated with the catastrophes    1.5127085093302464
of Mann's stories.   We shall return to these statements    1.5127085093302464
and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates.    1.6432600607208703
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of    1.7026049541338664
Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all these elements come together    1.6432600607208703
in prophetic parody. Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated    1.6065767145351917
with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially    1.5127085093302464
middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself    1.6065767145351917
dressed up, disguised- that is, paradoxically, revealed- as a    1.5127085093302464
child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child. That this abandonment    1.67495327387791
takes place on a stage, during an 'artistic' performance,    1.5127085093302464
is enough to associate Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the    1.7026049541338664
punishment for art; that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable, as    1.6065767145351917
is anyone in Mann's stories who produces <illusion>, and this is    1.6065767145351917
true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature, technique,    1.5636360329510388
magic, guilt and suffering, are divided in this story between Jacoby    1.6065767145351917
and La^utner.   It appears that the dominant tendency of    1.5127085093302464
Mann's early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque the surface,    1.5636360329510388
is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic, the expressionistic.    1.5127085093302464
In a certain perfectly definite way, the method and the theme of his    1.67495327387791
stories are one and the same.   Something of this can be learned    1.6432600607208703
from "The Way to the Churchyard" (1901), an anecdote about    1.5636360329510388
an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die    1.7269387314284994
of a stroke or seizure. There is no more "plot" than that; only    1.67495327387791
slightly more, perhaps, than a newspaper account of such an incident    1.6065767145351917
would give. The artistic interest, then, lies in what the encounter    1.6065767145351917
may be made to represent, in the power of some central significance    1.6432600607208703
to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.   The first    1.5636360329510388
sentence, with its platitudinous irony, announces an emblematic intent:    1.5127085093302464
"The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad, ran    1.6065767145351917
beside it all the way to the end; that is to say, to the churchyard".    1.7269387314284994
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction.    1.6065767145351917
The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while    1.6065767145351917
the way to the churchyard belongs to death. But that is too simple,    1.67495327387791
and won't hold up. As the first sentence suggests, both roads belong    1.6432600607208703
to death in the end. But the highroad, according to the description    1.6432600607208703
of its traffic, belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death,    1.7026049541338664
while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life:    1.67495327387791
a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in the awareness    1.5636360329510388
of death. Thus, on the highroad, a troop of soldiers "marched in their    1.67495327387791
own dust and sang", while on the footpath one man walks alone.   1.6432600607208703
This man's isolation is not merely momentary, it is permanent.    1.5636360329510388
He is a widower, his three children are dead, he has no one left on    1.7269387314284994
earth; also he is a drunk, and has lost his job on that account. His    1.7269387314284994
name is Praisegod Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to    1.6432600607208703
his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister    1.67495327387791
type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic    1.6432600607208703
strangers in "Death in Venice", for example, who represent    1.5127085093302464
some combination of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.   This strange    1.5127085093302464
person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path    1.6432600607208703
rather than the highroad. The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace    1.5127085093302464
young fellow, is not named but identified simply as "Life"- that    1.6065767145351917
and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him. "Life"    1.6065767145351917
points out that "everybody uses this path", and starts to ride    1.6065767145351917
on. Piepsam tries to stop him by force, receives a push in the chest    1.7026049541338664
from "Life", and is left standing in impotent and growing rage,    1.6065767145351917
while a crowd begins to gather. His rage assumes a religious form;    1.6432600607208703
that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness,    1.6432600607208703
Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God    1.7026049541338664
imprecates doom on Life- not only the cyclist now, but the audience,    1.6432600607208703
the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed". This passion    1.5636360329510388
brings on a fit which proves fatal. Then an ambulance comes along,    1.6432600607208703
and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away.   This is simple enough,    1.5636360329510388
but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant. The    1.6432600607208703
season, between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree    1.6065767145351917
aspect. Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because <he> cannot    1.5636360329510388
stop the cyclist, but also because God will not stop him; as Piepsam    1.67495327387791
says to the crowd in his last moments: "His justice is not of    1.67495327387791
this world".   Life is further characterized, in antithesis to    1.5127085093302464
Piepsam, as animal: the image of a dog, which appears at several    1.6432600607208703
places, is first given as the criterion of amiable, irrelevant interest    1.6065767145351917
aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon    1.67495327387791
is "admirable", "a pleasure to contemplate"; another wagon    1.4513752902486308
has no dog, and therefore is "devoid of interest". Piepsam calls    1.6065767145351917
the cyclist "cur" and "puppy" among other things, and at the crisis    1.6432600607208703
of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into    1.6432600607208703
his face. The ambulance is drawn by two "charming" little horses.   1.6065767145351917
Piepsam is not, certainly, religious in any conventional sense.    1.5127085093302464
His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically, connected with    1.4513752902486308
his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical. His unsuccessful    1.6065767145351917
strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings;    1.5636360329510388
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home, and "before this wardrobe Praisegod    1.7026049541338664
Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees, and in    1.6065767145351917
his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated".   1.6432600607208703
The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is simply    1.5127085093302464
unreflective, unproblematic Life, "blithe and carefree". "He    1.3761581156320553
made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth".   1.67495327387791
Piepsam is grotesque, a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous    1.5636360329510388
and trivial. He is "a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard".    1.7026049541338664
But he is more interesting than the others, the ones who come from    1.67495327387791
the highroad to watch him, more interesting than Life considered    1.5636360329510388
as a cyclist. And if I have gone into so much detail about so small    1.7269387314284994
a work, that is because it is also so typical a work, representing the    1.7026049541338664
germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing:    1.6065767145351917
the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical, destructive    1.5636360329510388
and self-destructive tendencies, much that is enlarged and illuminated    1.5127085093302464
in the figures of, for instance, Naphta and Leverku^hn.   1.5127085093302464
In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details    1.67495327387791
selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for "realism",    1.5636360329510388
anticipates a kind of musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional    1.67495327387791
composition, in which, as Leverku^hn says, "there shall be    1.5127085093302464
nothing unthematic". It resembles, too, pictures such as Du^rer    1.5127085093302464
and Bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial    1.7026049541338664
proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a    1.6065767145351917
proverb, for example, or a deadly sin.   "Gladius Dei" (1902)    1.5636360329510388
resembles "The Way to the Churchyard" in its representation    1.5127085093302464
of a conflict between light and dark, between "Life" and a spirit    1.6432600607208703
of criticism, negation, melancholy, but it goes considerably further    1.5127085093302464
in characterizing the elements of this conflict.   The monk Savonarola,    1.5636360329510388
brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background    1.5636360329510388
of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious    1.6432600607208703
works displayed in the art-shop of M& Bluthenzweig; in    1.5127085093302464
particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled,    1.6065767145351917
according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress. Hieronymus,    1.4513752902486308
like Piepsam, makes his protest quite in vain, and his rejection, though    1.6432600607208703
not fatal, is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out    1.6065767145351917
of the shop by the porter. On the street outside, Hieronymus envisions    1.6432600607208703
a holocaust of the vanities of this world, such a burning of artistic    1.67495327387791
and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in    1.6065767145351917
Florence, and prophetically he issues his curse: "<Gladius Dei    1.5127085093302464
super terram cito et velociter>".    1.1606783668269585
The "reality" to which they respond is rationally empty and their    1.6065767145351917
art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and    1.6432600607208703
empty world. Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.   1.6432600607208703
These polar concerns (imitation vs& formalism) reflect    1.3761581156320553
a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing    1.5127085093302464
over a long period of time. The breakdown of classical structures of    1.6432600607208703
meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations    1.67495327387791
of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes.    1.4513752902486308
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal    1.6065767145351917
and spiritual qualities, and complete objectification in sub-human and    1.5127085093302464
quasi-mechanistic powers. The image of the world tends to reflect the    1.6065767145351917
hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces    1.6432600607208703
and overwhelming mystery. The image of God has simply disappeared.    1.5636360329510388
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory    1.6432600607208703
response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism:    1.6065767145351917
if man can neither know nor love reality as it is, he can at    1.7026049541338664
least invent an artistic "reality" which is its own world and which    1.6432600607208703
can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable    1.6065767145351917
of being known and worthy of being loved. The person of the artist    1.67495327387791
becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by    1.6432600607208703
the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical    1.6432600607208703
systems.   Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and    1.5127085093302464
whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding    1.5127085093302464
the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually    1.67495327387791
exclusive, that they belong together. Without the decay of a    1.5636360329510388
sense of objective reference (except as the imitation of mystery), the    1.6065767145351917
stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into    1.5636360329510388
being. And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves    1.7026049541338664
insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art, their peculiar    1.5127085093302464
authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously    1.6432600607208703
and gives promise that from their very substance, new and valid    1.6065767145351917
chapters in the philosophy of art may be written. For better or worse    1.67495327387791
we cannot regard "imitation" in the arts in the simple mode of    1.6432600607208703
classical rationalism or detached realism. A broader concept of imitation    1.5636360329510388
is needed, one which acknowledges that true invention is important,    1.5636360329510388
that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic    1.5127085093302464
causal factors out of which it arises. On the other hand, we cannot regard    1.7026049541338664
artistic invention as pure, uncaused, and unrelated to the times    1.5636360329510388
in which it occurs. We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from    1.7026049541338664
the solipsism and futility of pure formalism. Accordingly, it is the    1.6065767145351917
aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation (which I shall    1.7026049541338664
call <mimesis> in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of    1.6065767145351917
imitation) and a new theory of invention (which I shall call <symbol>    1.6432600607208703
for reasons to be stated hereafter).    1.2818970554302986
The word "mimesis" ("imitation") is usually associated    1.3761581156320553
with Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, "imitation" is twice    1.5127085093302464
removed from reality, being a poor copy of physical appearance, which    1.6065767145351917
in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence. All artistic and mythological    1.67495327387791
representations, therefore, are "imitations of imitations" and    1.3761581156320553
are completely superseded by the truth value of "dialectic", the    1.5636360329510388
proper use of the inquiring intellect. In Plato's judgment, the    1.5636360329510388
arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young,    1.7026049541338664
prior to the full development of their intellectual powers. Presupposed    1.5636360329510388
in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which    1.6432600607208703
a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating    1.6065767145351917
to the most sublime wisdom. Aristotle also tended to stratify all    1.6065767145351917
aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and,    1.6065767145351917
like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.    1.67495327387791
The <Poetics>, in affirming that all human arts are "modes    1.5636360329510388
of imitation", gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than    1.6065767145351917
did Plato. But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented    1.6432600607208703
it by describing in the <Poetics> what kinds of character and    1.6065767145351917
action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and    1.7269387314284994
important human truths. For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis,    1.5636360329510388
in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of    1.6065767145351917
expressing the character of fundamental reality.   The central    1.4513752902486308
concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called <Mimesis>    1.4513752902486308
is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation (based upon    1.67495327387791
a recognition of levels of truth) to a Christian theory of imitation    1.6432600607208703
in which the levels are dissolved. Following the theme of Incarnation    1.6065767145351917
in the Gospels, the Christian artist and critic sees in the most    1.6432600607208703
commonplace and ordinary events "figures" of divine power and reality.    1.5636360329510388
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation    1.5636360329510388
in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent.    1.4513752902486308
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement    1.4513752902486308
of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama. The artist, unlike    1.6432600607208703
the philosopher, is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified    1.6432600607208703
high levels of abstraction. He is the conveyor of a sacred reality    1.6432600607208703
by which he has been grasped. I have chosen to use the word "mimesis"    1.7026049541338664
in its Christian rather than its classic implications and    1.5127085093302464
to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological    1.7026049541338664
expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the direct consequence    1.6065767145351917
of involvement in historical experience, which are not reserved,    1.5127085093302464
as in the Greek mind, only to moments of theoretical reflection.   1.6065767145351917
In the first instance, "mimesis" is here used to mean the    1.6065767145351917
recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms    1.6432600607208703
of abstract ideas or conventional designations. By "image" is meant    1.5636360329510388
not only a visual presentation, but also remembered sensations of any    1.6065767145351917
of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined    1.6065767145351917
therewith. This is the primary function of the imagination operating    1.5636360329510388
in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images    1.6432600607208703
were first appropriated. Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to    1.5636360329510388
the actual re-living of experience, in which the imagining person recovers    1.6065767145351917
through images something of the force and depth characteristic    1.5127085093302464
of experience itself. The images themselves, like their counterparts    1.5127085093302464
in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately;    1.5636360329510388
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities    1.6432600607208703
and a unique relatedness to one another. They bring an inextricable    1.6065767145351917
component of value within themselves, with attractions and repulsions    1.5127085093302464
native to their own quality. As in experience one is seized by    1.6432600607208703
given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in    1.6065767145351917
value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation    1.67495327387791
of images. Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism    1.6065767145351917
or realism in the conventional sense. A word taken in its dictionary    1.6432600607208703
meaning, a photographic image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing    1.6065767145351917
of a "scene" tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote    1.6065767145351917
such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without    1.5127085093302464
the incitement of value feelings. Similarly experience itself can    1.5127085093302464
be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues    1.5636360329510388
for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential    1.5636360329510388
field. A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection    1.5636360329510388
to a sense of immediacy.   The mimetic character of the    1.5636360329510388
imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation    1.5127085093302464
of artistic forms and materials. When words can be used in a more fresh    1.7026049541338664
and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and    1.67495327387791
sounds, when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape    1.67495327387791
all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of    1.67495327387791
themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude of attention, all    1.5636360329510388
this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes    1.6065767145351917
upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance. These    1.5636360329510388
are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self    1.7026049541338664
and thrusts the self into decision and choice. The presence of genuine    1.6432600607208703
mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work    1.6432600607208703
demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely    1.6065767145351917
understood.   Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain    1.4513752902486308
presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which    1.5127085093302464
require some exposition before the main argument can proceed. Experience    1.5636360329510388
is not seen, as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting    1.6065767145351917
us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space    1.6065767145351917
and    1.0
registering their character, movements, and changes on the <tabula    1.5127085093302464
rasa> of an uninvolved intellect. Neither is primary experience understood    1.5636360329510388
according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing    1.5636360329510388
is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing    1.6432600607208703
their responses in the appropriate sense organs. Primary feelings    1.5127085093302464
of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects    1.6432600607208703
(houses, trees, implements, etc&) nor a collection of isolated and    1.5636360329510388
neutral sensory qualities. In contrast to all this, primary data are    1.6065767145351917
data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.   The    1.6065767145351917
most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings, both positive    1.5127085093302464
and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment    1.67495327387791
into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other    1.6432600607208703
part. These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers    1.5636360329510388
in which one is involved, some working for one's good, others threatening    1.6432600607208703
ill. Gone is the <tabula rasa> of the mind. In its place    1.6432600607208703
is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive    1.6065767145351917
or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined    1.6432600607208703
by constellations of process in which one is caught.   The principal    1.6065767145351917
defender of this view of primary experience as "causal efficacy"    1.5636360329510388
is Alfred North Whitehead. Our most elemental and unavoidable    1.5127085093302464
impressions, he says, are those of being involved in a large arena of    1.67495327387791
powers which have a longer past than our own, which are interrelated    1.6432600607208703
in a vast movement through the present toward the future. We feel the    1.67495327387791
quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening.    1.6432600607208703
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors    1.4513752902486308
of judgment in these apprehensions of value, but the apprehensions themselves    1.6065767145351917
are the primary stuff of experience. It takes a great deal    1.6065767145351917
of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger    1.6065767145351917
unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a    1.67495327387791
collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern,    1.6432600607208703
devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far    1.7026049541338664
as they present themselves for inspection. Whitehead is here questioning    1.5636360329510388
David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he    1.5127085093302464
is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's    1.5127085093302464
presupposition    1.0
that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from    1.5127085093302464
causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually    1.5127085093302464
imputed to the world, not directly perceived. What Hume calls "sensation"    1.6065767145351917
is what Whitehead calls "perception in the mode of presentational    1.5636360329510388
immediacy" which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception    1.4513752902486308
in the mode of causal efficacy. As long as perception is seen as    1.67495327387791
composed only of isolated sense data, most of the quality and interconnectedness    1.6432600607208703
of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention    1.4513752902486308
of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical scepticism. Whitehead    1.5636360329510388
contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity    1.6065767145351917
of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other    1.5127085093302464
and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because    1.7269387314284994
the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and    1.6432600607208703
tendency to mistake the detail, is initially <given> in the way man    1.6432600607208703
feels the world. In this respect experience is broader and full of    1.6432600607208703
a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of    1.7026049541338664
his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct.    1.6065767145351917
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is    1.6432600607208703
one of derivation from the past. Both I and my feelings come up out    1.7026049541338664
of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are    1.7269387314284994
ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am.    1.5127085093302464
After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications    1.5636360329510388
of melioration, though "in a slight degree", to be sure.   1.5636360329510388
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century. I leave    1.5636360329510388
it to the statisticians to say what they were, but I noticed several    1.67495327387791
a few years ago, during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg.    1.6432600607208703
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school    1.6065767145351917
and the White school, and in every instance the former made a better    1.67495327387791
appearance (it was newer, for one thing). It really looked as if a    1.67495327387791
change of the sort predicted by Booker T& Washington had been going    1.6432600607208703
on. But with the renewal of interference in 1954 (as with its beginning    1.67495327387791
in 1835), the improvement was impaired.   For over a hundred    1.5636360329510388
years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them.    1.6065767145351917
It's infuriating, this feeling that one is being picked on, continually,    1.6065767145351917
constantly. By what right of superior virtue, Southerners ask,    1.5127085093302464
do the people of the North do this? The traditional strategy of the    1.67495327387791
South has been to expose the vices of the North, to demonstrate that    1.67495327387791
the North possessed no superior virtue, to "show the world that"    1.6065767145351917
(as James's Christopher Newman said to <his> adversaries) "however    1.5127085093302464
bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it".   1.6432600607208703
In the pre-Civil War years, the South argued that the slave was    1.6432600607208703
not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North. At    1.6432600607208703
the present time, the counter-attack takes the line that there's no    1.6065767145351917
more of the true <spirit> of "integration" in the North than    1.6065767145351917
in the South. The line is a pretty good one.   People talk about    1.67495327387791
"the law of the land". The expression has become quite a cliche.    1.6432600607208703
But people can't be made to integrate, socialize (the two are inseparable    1.6432600607208703
by Southern standards) by law.   I was having lunch not    1.5636360329510388
long ago (apologies to N& V& Peale) with three distinguished    1.5636360329510388
historians (one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American    1.6065767145351917
history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them if they    1.67495327387791
could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed    1.6065767145351917
with "deliberate speed, majestic instancy" (Francis Thompson's    1.3761581156320553
words for the Hound of <Heaven's> pursuit) by judicial fiat.    1.5636360329510388
They didn't seem to be able to think of any.   A Virginia    1.6432600607208703
judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years    1.7026049541338664
might be a reasonable length of time for such a change. But I suspect    1.7026049541338664
that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation-    1.6432600607208703
the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he    1.6065767145351917
said, "They make a desert, and call it peace" ("Solitudinem faciunt,    1.6065767145351917
pacem appellant".).   1.0
Moreover, the law of the land is not    1.4513752902486308
irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been, many times. Mr&    1.6065767145351917
Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the    1.6065767145351917
North, and soon became a dead letter. Prohibition was the law of the    1.67495327387791
land, but it was unpopular (how many of us oldsters took up drinking    1.67495327387791
in prohibition days, drinking was so gay, so fashionable, especially    1.5636360329510388
in the sophisticated Northeast!) and was repealed. The cliche loses    1.5636360329510388
its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.   The    1.6065767145351917
Declaration of Independence says that "governments derive their    1.4513752902486308
just powers from the consent of the governed". The phrase "consent    1.6065767145351917
of the governed" needs a hard look. How do we define it? Is the    1.7026049541338664
consent of the governed a numerical majority? Calhoun dealt with    1.5636360329510388
this question in his "Disquisition on Government".   To guard    1.5127085093302464
against the tyranny of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his    1.5636360329510388
theory of "concurrent majority", which, he said, "by giving to    1.5636360329510388
each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the    1.6432600607208703
action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial    1.6065767145351917
or local legislation". Who will say that our country is even now a    1.67495327387791
homogeneous community? that regional peculiarities do not still exist?    1.5127085093302464
that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region?    1.6065767145351917
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal    1.67495327387791
action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of "the consent    1.5636360329510388
of the governed"?   Circumstances alter cases. A friend    1.4513752902486308
of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular    1.67495327387791
trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell. He    1.7026049541338664
seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular    1.6065767145351917
trouble anywhere. I murmured something about a possible difference between    1.5636360329510388
New Mexico's history and Mississippi's.   One can meet    1.4513752902486308
with aloofness almost anywhere: the Thank-Heaven-We're-not-Involved    1.2818970554302986
viewpoint, It Doesn't Affect Us! Southern Liberals    1.3761581156320553
(there are a good many)- especially if they're rich- often exhibit    1.6065767145351917
blithe insouciance. The trouble here is that it's almost too easy    1.6065767145351917
to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything.    1.6432600607208703
You've already sent your daughter to Miss ~X's select academy    1.5636360329510388
for girls and your son to Mr& ~Y's select academy for boys, and    1.67495327387791
you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity. If there's    1.67495327387791
no suitable academy in your own neighborhood, there's always New    1.5636360329510388
England. New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces,    1.5127085093302464
South as well as West. They may even enroll a colored student    1.6432600607208703
or two for show, though he usually turns out to be from Thailand, or    1.7026049541338664
any place other than the American South. It would be interesting to    1.6432600607208703
know how much "integration" there is in the famous, fashionable colleges    1.6065767145351917
and prep schools of New England. A recent newspaper report    1.5636360329510388
said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one    1.67495327387791
thousand at Yale; that is, about one-half of one per cent, which    1.6432600607208703
looks pretty "tokenish" to me, especially in an institution which    1.5636360329510388
professes to be "national".   I must confess that I prefer    1.5636360329510388
the Liberal who is personally affected, who is willing to send his own    1.67495327387791
children to a mixed school as proof of his faith. I leave out of account    1.7269387314284994
the question of the best interests of the children, the question    1.6065767145351917
of what their best interests really are. I'm talking about the grand    1.6432600607208703
manner of the Liberal- North <and> South- who is not affected    1.6065767145351917
personally. If these people were denied a voice (do they have a    1.6432600607208703
moral right to a voice?), what voices would be left? Who is involved    1.67495327387791
<willy nilly?> Well, after everybody has followed the New England    1.5636360329510388
pattern of segregating one's children into private schools,    1.4513752902486308
only the poor folks are left. And it is precisely in this poorer economic    1.7026049541338664
class that one finds, and has always found, the most racial friction.    1.6432600607208703
A dear, respected friend of mine, who like myself grew up    1.6065767145351917
in the South and has spent many years in New England, said to me    1.7026049541338664
not long ago: "I can't forgive New England for rejecting    1.5636360329510388
all complicity". Being a teacher of American literature, I remembered    1.5636360329510388
Whittier's "Massachusetts to Virginia", where he said:    1.3761581156320553
"But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone,    1.6065767145351917
And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown". There    1.6065767145351917
is a legend (Hawthorne records it in his "English Notebooks". and    1.6065767145351917
one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page) to the effect that the    1.67495327387791
<Mayflower>    1.0
on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves. Whether    1.6065767145351917
historically a fact or not, the legend has a certain symbolic value.   1.6432600607208703
<Complicity> is an embarrassing word. It is something    1.4513752902486308
which most of us try to get out from under. Like the cowboy in Stephen    1.7269387314284994
Crane's "Blue Hotel", we run around crying, "Well, I    1.5127085093302464
didn't do anything, did I"? Robert Penn Warren puts it this    1.6065767145351917
way in "Brother to Dragons": "The recognition of complicity    1.5127085093302464
is the beginning of innocence", where innocence, I think, means    1.5636360329510388
about the same thing as redemption. A man must be able to say, "Father,    1.7026049541338664
I have sinned",    1.0
or there is no hope for him. Lincoln understood    1.5127085093302464
this better than most when he said in his "Second Inaugural"    1.6065767145351917
that God "gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the    1.67495327387791
woe due to those by whom the offense came". He also spoke of "the    1.7026049541338664
wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited    1.6432600607208703
toil". Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that    1.5636360329510388
a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of    1.6432600607208703
the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade. After    1.6065767145351917
how many generations is such wealth (mounting all the while through    1.6065767145351917
the manipulations of high finance) purified of taint? It is a question    1.6432600607208703
which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds. But didn't    1.6432600607208703
they get off too easy? The slaves never shared in <their> profits,    1.6432600607208703
while they did share, in a very real sense, in the profits of the    1.7026049541338664
slave-owners: they were fed, clothed, doctored, and so forth; they    1.5636360329510388
were the beneficiaries of responsible, paternalistic care.    1.3761581156320553
Emerson- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire- sounded a high Transcendental    1.4513752902486308
note in his "Boston Hymn", delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music    1.6432600607208703
Hall amidst thundering applause: "Pay ransom to the owner and    1.5636360329510388
fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is owner,    1.7026049541338664
And ever was. Pay him"! It is the abstractionism, the unrealism,    1.6065767145351917
of the pure idealist. It ignores the sordid financial aspects (quite    1.6065767145351917
conveniently, too, for his audience, who could indulge in moral indignation    1.6065767145351917
without visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money    1.4513752902486308
from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic    1.67495327387791
brokerage). Like Pilate, they had washed their hands. But can one,    1.6065767145351917
really? Can God be mocked, ever, in the long run?   New    1.6065767145351917
Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in    1.6432600607208703
Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence,    1.67495327387791
as Jefferson explained in his "Autobiography": "   1.2818970554302986
The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa    1.5127085093302464
was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who    1.6065767145351917
had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on    1.6432600607208703
the contrary still wished to continue it. Our Northern brethren also    1.6065767145351917
I believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their    1.6432600607208703
people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable    1.6432600607208703
carriers of them to others".   But that was a long    1.5636360329510388
time ago. The New England conscience became desensitized. George    1.5127085093302464
W& Cable (naturalized New Englander), writing in 1889 from "Paradise    1.5636360329510388
Road, Northampton" (lovely symbolic name), agitated continuously    1.3761581156320553
the "<Southern> question". It was nice to be able to isolate    1.6065767145351917
New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster    1.5127085093302464
to the Nation. There one finds concentrated in a comparatively    1.5636360329510388
small area the chief universities, colleges, and preparatory schools    1.5127085093302464
of the United States. Why should this be so? It is true that New    1.7026049541338664
England, more than any other section, was dedicated to education    1.5636360329510388
from the start. But I think that something more than this is involved.   1.67495327387791
How did it happen, for example, that the state university,    1.5636360329510388
that great symbol of American democracy, failed to flourish in New England    1.6432600607208703
as it did in other parts of the country? Isn't it a bit odd    1.7026049541338664
that the three states of Southern New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut,    1.5636360329510388
and Rhode Island) have had state institutions of university    1.5127085093302464
status only in the very recent past, these institutions having previously    1.6065767145351917
been ~A+~M colleges? Was it supposed, perchance, that    1.4513752902486308
~A+~M (vocational training, that is) was quite sufficient for the    1.5636360329510388
immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in    1.6432600607208703
the post-Civil War period, the immigrants having been brought in from    1.6065767145351917
Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for the labor    1.67495327387791
shortage caused by migration to the West? Is it not ironical that    1.6432600607208703
Roger Williams's state, Rhode Island, should have been the very    1.5636360329510388
last of the forty-eight to establish a state university? The state    1.6065767145351917
universities of Maine, New Hampshire, And Vermont are older and more    1.6065767145351917
"respectable"; they had less immigration to contend with.   1.4513752902486308
A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in <The Yale Review>,    1.6432600607208703
said: "We in New England have long since segregated our children".    1.6065767145351917
He was referring not only to the general college situation    1.5636360329510388
but more especially to the preparatory schools. And what a galaxy of    1.6432600607208703
those adorns that fair land! I don't propose to go into their history,    1.67495327387791
but I have one or two surmises. One is that they were established,    1.67495327387791
or gained eminence, under pressure provided by these same immigrants,    1.5636360329510388
from whom the old families wished to segregate their children.    1.5636360329510388
In the early days of a homogeneous population, the public school was    1.6432600607208703
quite satisfactory.   1.0
AMONG THE RECIPIENTS of the Nobel Prize for Literature    1.5127085093302464
more than half are practically unknown to readers of English. Of these    1.6432600607208703
there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than    1.6065767145351917
Verner von Heidenstam, the Swedish poet and novelist who received    1.5636360329510388
the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago.    1.6432600607208703
Equally a master of prose and verse, he recreates the glory of Sweden    1.67495327387791
in the past and continues it into the present. In the following sketch    1.67495327387791
we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as    1.7269387314284994
possible speak for himself.   Heidenstam was born in 1859, of    1.5636360329510388
a prosperous family. On his father's side he was of German descent,    1.6432600607208703
on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility. The family    1.6432600607208703
estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Va^ttern in south central    1.6065767145351917
Sweden. It is a lonely, rather desolate region, but full of legendary    1.6432600607208703
and historic associations. As a boy in a local school he was shy    1.67495327387791
and solitary, absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of    1.6432600607208703
Sweden's ancient glory. He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain    1.6065767145351917
and to dress for the part. Being somewhat delicate in health, at the    1.67495327387791
age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once    1.7026049541338664
developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten    1.67495327387791
years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor,    1.6432600607208703
and Palestine. In one of his summers at home he married, to the    1.67495327387791
great disapproval of his father, who objected because of his extreme youth.   1.6432600607208703
Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio of Gerome    1.6065767145351917
in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the artists, but soon found    1.67495327387791
that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction.    1.6432600607208703
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem, "The    1.7026049541338664
Happy Artists". "I scanned the world through printed symbol    1.5127085093302464
swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man.    1.67495327387791
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart".    1.6432600607208703
In this final line, we have the key to his nature. Few writers    1.67495327387791
have better understood their deepest selves. Heidenstam could never be    1.5636360329510388
satisfied by surface. It may, however, be noted that his gift for color    1.67495327387791
and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.   1.6432600607208703
The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was    1.5127085093302464
a volume of poems, <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years (Vallfart och vandringsar),>    1.5636360329510388
published in 1888. It was a brilliant debut, so much so    1.6065767145351917
indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's    1.7026049541338664
<Childe Harold>. Professor Fredrik Bo^o^k, Sweden's    1.2818970554302986
foremost critic of the period, acclaims it as follows: "In    1.5636360329510388
this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful, plastic, racy,    1.6432600607208703
vivid. In a bold, sometimes careless, form there is nothing academic;    1.6065767145351917
all is seen and felt and experienced, the observation is sharp    1.6065767145351917
and the imagination lively. The young poet-painter reproduces the French    1.5636360329510388
life of the streets; he tells stories of the Thousand and One    1.6432600607208703
Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus. In the    1.6432600607208703
care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the    1.6432600607208703
old happy existence, and for that reason he loves it. And yet amid all    1.7026049541338664
the gay hedonism in <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years> is a cycle of    1.6065767145351917
short poems, "Thoughts in Loneliness", filled with brooding, melancholy,    1.5127085093302464
and sombre longing".   Of the longer pieces of the volume    1.5636360329510388
none is so memorable as "Nameless and Immortal", which at    1.5636360329510388
once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language.    1.67495327387791
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of    1.5636360329510388
Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian    1.6432600607208703
classic style now in existence. On the eve of his return to their    1.67495327387791
native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises    1.6432600607208703
before them in its completed perfection. The supreme object of their    1.6065767145351917
lives is now fulfilled, says the wife, her husband has achieved immortality.    1.6432600607208703
Not so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple    1.6432600607208703
that is immortal. "The man's true reputation is his work".   1.5636360329510388
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as "Thoughts    1.6432600607208703
in Loneliness" is, as Professor Bo^o^k indicated, in sharp contrast    1.5636360329510388
with the others. It consists of fragmentary personal revelations,    1.5127085093302464
such as "The Spark": "There is a spark dwells deep within    1.6065767145351917
my soul. To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's    1.67495327387791
aim both first and last, the whole. It slips away, it burns and tortures    1.7026049541338664
me. That little spark is all the wealth I know, That little spark    1.67495327387791
is my life's misery". A dominant motive is the poet's longing    1.6065767145351917
for his homeland and its boyhood associations: "Not men-folk, but    1.5636360329510388
the fields where I would stray, The stones where as a child I used    1.7026049541338664
to play". He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory    1.6432600607208703
life he has been leading. What he really wants is to find "a    1.67495327387791
sacred cause" to which he can honestly devote himself. This restless    1.6065767145351917
individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all    1.6065767145351917
the rest of his life in Sweden. His cause was to commemorate the glory    1.7026049541338664
of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.   1.7026049541338664
He did not, however, find himself at once. His next major    1.6065767145351917
work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic epic in prose, entitled    1.6432600607208703
<Hans Alienus,> which Professor Bo^o^k describes as a monument    1.5127085093302464
on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth. The hero, who is    1.67495327387791
himself, is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East,    1.67495327387791
a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from Professor Bo^o^k again,    1.6432600607208703
"even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from    1.6065767145351917
his painful search after the meaning of life. He is driven back by    1.67495327387791
his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of    1.67495327387791
Tiveden".   From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his    1.5636360329510388
deeper self. By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession    1.7269387314284994
of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions. He    1.5636360329510388
did not, however, settle back into acquiescence with things as they were.    1.6432600607208703
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little    1.5636360329510388
patience with collective mediocrity. He saw Sweden as a country of    1.6065767145351917
smug and narrow provincialism, indifferent to the heroic spirit of its    1.6065767145351917
former glory. Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear    1.5636360329510388
down the old structures and build anew from the ground up. Heidenstam's    1.6432600607208703
conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories    1.6432600607208703
Whether in prose or poetry, all of Heidenstam's    1.4513752902486308
later work was concerned with Sweden. With the first of a group    1.6432600607208703
of historical novels, <The Charles Men (Karolinerna)>, published    1.4513752902486308
in 1897-8, he achieved the masterpiece of his career. In scope    1.6065767145351917
and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's <War and Peace>.    1.6432600607208703
About one-third as long, it is less intimate and detailed, but better    1.6432600607208703
coordinated, more concise and more dramatic. Though it centers around    1.5636360329510388
the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles /12,, the true hero    1.6065767145351917
is not finally the king himself. Hence the title of the book, referring    1.67495327387791
to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield    1.6432600607208703
of Poltava, to quote from the novel, "the wreath he twined for    1.6432600607208703
himself slipped down upon his people".   <The Charles Men>    1.5127085093302464
consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories,    1.67495327387791
each depicting a special phase of the general subject. Somewhat uneven    1.6065767145351917
in interest for an average reader, eight or ten of these are among    1.67495327387791
the finest of their kind in literature. They comprise a great variety    1.6432600607208703
of scene and interest: grim episodes of war, idyllic interludes, superb    1.6065767145351917
canvases of world-shaking events, and delightfully humorous sketches    1.4513752902486308
of odd characters. The general effect is tragic. Almost nothing    1.5636360329510388
is said of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme being    1.5636360329510388
the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune    1.67495327387791
and defeat.   To carry out this exalted conception the    1.5127085093302464
author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed    1.6432600607208703
in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale. His    1.67495327387791
peculiar gift, as had been suggested before, is his intensity. George    1.6065767145351917
Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style. Of few authors    1.67495327387791
is this more true than of Heidenstam. <The Charles Men> has a tremendous    1.67495327387791
range of characters, of common folk even more than of major    1.6065767145351917
figures. The career of Charles /12, is obviously very similar to that    1.6432600607208703
of Napoleon. His ideal was Alexander of Macedon, as Napoleon's    1.5636360329510388
was Julius Caesar. His purpose, however, was not to establish an    1.6065767145351917
empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice. Each aspired    1.6065767145351917
to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god.    1.7677783654484436
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought    1.6065767145351917
ruin on the country that worshipped him. Each is still glorified    1.6065767145351917
as a national hero.   The first half of <The Charles Men,>    1.6065767145351917
ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709, is more dramatically    1.7026049541338664
coherent than the second. After the collapse of that desperate    1.5636360329510388
and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a    1.6065767145351917
time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous.    1.6432600607208703
Like Napoleon, he was the worst of losers. There are, however, some    1.6432600607208703
wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part, concerning    1.5636360329510388
the reactions of the Swedes in adversity. Then more than ever before    1.6432600607208703
did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness. This comes    1.5636360329510388
out in "When the Bells Ring", which describes the rallying of the    1.6432600607208703
peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.   1.6065767145351917
In "The King's Ride", Charles breaks out of a long period    1.6065767145351917
of petulance and inertia, regains his old self, escapes from Turkey,    1.6065767145351917
and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years.    1.6432600607208703
He finds it in utter misery and desolation. All his people ask for    1.67495327387791
is no more war. But he plunges into yet another, this time with Norway,    1.7026049541338664
and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall, being    1.6432600607208703
only thirty-six years of age when he died. He had become king at fifteen.   1.7026049541338664
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular    1.5127085093302464
feeling. From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol    1.67495327387791
of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden. This is    1.7026049541338664
brought out in the next to last chapter of the book, "A Hero's    1.67495327387791
Funeral", written in the form of an impassioned prose poem. Slowly    1.6065767145351917
the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside    1.6065767145351917
the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral, the shrine    1.6065767145351917
of so many precious memories. The guns are fired, the hymns are    1.6432600607208703
sung, and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside    1.7269387314284994
the tombs of his ancestors. As he had longed to be, he became the    1.7026049541338664
echo of a saga.   Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction    1.6065767145351917
about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory. Excellent in their    1.5636360329510388
way, they lack the wide appeal of <The Charles Men>, and need    1.6432600607208703
not detain us here. It is different with his volume <The Swedes    1.6432600607208703
and Their Chieftains (Svenskarna och deras ho^vdingar),> a history    1.5127085093302464
intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high    1.5636360329510388
school students. Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to Swedish    1.6065767145351917
history for readers of other countries. Some of the earlier episodes    1.6065767145351917
have touches of the supernatural, as suited to the legendary background.    1.6065767145351917
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlo^f. Especially touching    1.4513752902486308
is the chapter, "The Little Sister", about a king's daughter    1.5636360329510388
who became a nun in the convent of St& Birgitta. The record    1.6432600607208703
teems with romance and adventure. Gustaf Vasa is a superb example,    1.6065767145351917
and Charles /10,, the conqueror of Denmark, hardly less so. Of    1.6065767145351917
Gustavus Adolphus and Charles /12, it is unnecessary to speak.    1.5636360329510388
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or    1.5636360329510388
handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always    1.6432600607208703
been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with    1.6432600607208703
those who have not. It is from this unpromising background that the    1.6432600607208703
THE mythological    1.0
private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential    1.6432600607208703
ways. On the one hand, he does not work for a large agency, but    1.7026049541338664
is almost always self-employed. As a free-lance investigator, the fictional    1.5636360329510388
detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client.    1.6065767145351917
For this reason, he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure,    1.6065767145351917
whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a    1.6432600607208703
9 to 5 routine. On the other hand, the fictional detective does not    1.67495327387791
break strikes or handle divorce cases; no client would ever think of    1.6432600607208703
asking him to do such things. Whatever his original assignment, the    1.6065767145351917
fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime, usually    1.6432600607208703
a murder. Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in    1.7026049541338664
name, he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police    1.67495327387791
themselves. He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to    1.6065767145351917
do so (frequently he does not receive a fee at all), but because he enjoys    1.7269387314284994
his work, because he firmly believes that murder must be punished.    1.6065767145351917
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman.    1.6065767145351917
He is, first and foremost, a defender of public morals, a servant of    1.67495327387791
society.   It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and    1.5636360329510388
public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological    1.6065767145351917
detective. By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and    1.5127085093302464
his freedom from external restraint, the private eye is a perfect embodiment    1.6432600607208703
of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing    1.6065767145351917
what you please and let the devil take the hindmost. At the same time,    1.7026049541338664
because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal    1.6065767145351917
dictates of his society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is    1.6432600607208703
in middle class eyes a virtuous man. In this way, the private detective    1.67495327387791
gets the best of two possible worlds. He is an individualist but    1.6432600607208703
not an anarchist; he is a public servant but not a cop. In short, the    1.7269387314284994
fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's    1.5636360329510388
ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere    1.6065767145351917
promote the public welfare. In the mystery story, as in <The    1.6065767145351917
Wealth of Nations,> individualism and the social good are two sides    1.6065767145351917
THERE is only one    1.0
catch to this idyllic arrangement: Adam Smith was wrong. Not only    1.6065767145351917
did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest    1.6432600607208703
number, he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to monopoly    1.6065767145351917
capitalism. The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe    1.5636360329510388
and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900. Now, although    1.6065767145351917
the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far    1.67495327387791
as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades    1.6432600607208703
of the 19th century that the private detective became an established    1.6065767145351917
figure in popular fiction. Sherlock Holmes, the ancestor of all private    1.6065767145351917
eyes, was born during the 1890s. Thus the transformation of Adam    1.6065767145351917
Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides    1.4513752902486308
closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life. Driven    1.6432600607208703
from the marketplace by the course of history, our hero disguises    1.6065767145351917
himself as a private detective. The birth of the myth compensates    1.6065767145351917
for the death of the ideal.   Even on the fictional level, however,    1.6432600607208703
the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully    1.6432600607208703
resolved. The individualism and public service of the private detective    1.5636360329510388
both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct:    1.6065767145351917
he enforces the law without being told to do so. The private eye is therefore    1.7269387314284994
a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society.    1.6432600607208703
The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between    1.6432600607208703
good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal.    1.6065767145351917
Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold good. As    1.5127085093302464
capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon    1.5636360329510388
force and violence for its survival, the private detective is placed    1.6065767145351917
in a serious dilemma. If he is good, he may not be legal; if he is    1.748515906000203
legal, he may not be good. It is the gradual unfolding and deepening    1.67495327387791
of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution    1.6065767145351917
WITH the advent of Sir Arthur    1.2818970554302986
Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the development of the modern private    1.5636360329510388
detective begins. Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist;    1.5127085093302464
he is very close to being a mental case. A brief list of the great    1.7269387314284994
detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr& Freud with    1.4513752902486308
ample food for thought. Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and    1.67495327387791
other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances    1.5127085093302464
induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse, an incredible    1.67495327387791
egotist, a confirmed misogynist. Holmes rebels against the social    1.5127085093302464
conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds. His    1.67495327387791
eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom. It was in order    1.6065767145351917
to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became    1.6432600607208703
a detective in the first place. As he informs Watson, "My life is    1.67495327387791
spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.    1.6432600607208703
These little problems help me to do so". Holmes is a public servant,    1.67495327387791
to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.   1.67495327387791
The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard    1.4513752902486308
provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric    1.6065767145351917
behavior. Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland    1.5636360329510388
Yard, Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality    1.6065767145351917
of the police. They for their part are convinced that Holmes    1.6065767145351917
is too "unorthodox" and "theoretical" to make a good detective.    1.5636360329510388
Why do the police find Holmes "unorthodox"? On the face of    1.6065767145351917
it, it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official    1.6065767145351917
police routine. Another, more interesting explanation, is hinted at by    1.5636360329510388
Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have    1.6065767145351917
made a magnificent criminal. The great detective modestly agrees. Watson's    1.5636360329510388
insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes    1.5127085093302464
and his arch-opponent, Dr& Moriarty. The two men resemble each other    1.6065767145351917
closely in their cunning, their egotism, their relentlessness. The    1.5127085093302464
first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty    1.6065767145351917
grappling together on the edge of a cliff. They are presumed    1.6065767145351917
to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace. Linked to Holmes    1.7026049541338664
even in death, Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great    1.5636360329510388
detective, the image of what our hero might have become were he not a    1.7026049541338664
public servant. Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the    1.6065767145351917
IN the modern English "whodunnit", this insinuation of    1.4513752902486308
latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared.    1.5636360329510388
Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey (the respective creations    1.5127085093302464
of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers) have retained    1.4513752902486308
Holmes'    1.0
egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits. Poirot and    1.6432600607208703
his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that    1.5636360329510388
they are also extremely dull. Their dedication to the status quo has    1.6432600607208703
been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism    1.6065767145351917
of a Sherlock Holmes. The latter's real descendents were unable    1.5636360329510388
to take root in England; they fled from the Victorian parlor    1.6065767145351917
and made their way across the stormy Atlantic. In the American "hardboiled"    1.6432600607208703
detective story of the '20s and '30s, the spirit of the    1.6065767145351917
mad genius from Baker Street lives on.   Like Holmes, the    1.5636360329510388
American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time. But    1.6065767145351917
unlike Holmes, he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt.    1.7026049541338664
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere, the "hardboiled"    1.4513752902486308
private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed    1.6432600607208703
isolation. His alienation is far more acute than Holmes'; he    1.5636360329510388
is not an eccentric but rather an outcast. With Rex Stout's Nero    1.6432600607208703
Wolfe, alienation is represented on a purely physical plane. Wolfe    1.5636360329510388
refuses to ever leave his own house, and spends most of his time drinking    1.7026049541338664
beer and playing with orchids. More profound and more disturbing,    1.5636360329510388
however, is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.    1.5636360329510388
In a society where everything is for sale, Marlowe is the only    1.6432600607208703
man who cannot be bought. His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary    1.67495327387791
and difficult existence. Beaten, bruised and exhausted, he pursues    1.5127085093302464
the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low    1.6065767145351917
morals, always alone, always despised. In the end, he gets his man, but    1.67495327387791
no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward. A similar    1.7026049541338664
tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers    1.5636360329510388
of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery    1.6432600607208703
stories, Dashiell Hammett's <The Maltese Falcon>. Sam Spade    1.4513752902486308
joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled    1.67495327387791
statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last, it turns    1.7026049541338664
out to be a fake. Now the detective must save his own skin by informing    1.7269387314284994
on the girl he loves, who is also the real murderer. For Sam Spade,    1.7026049541338664
neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover, it is increasingly difficult    1.5636360329510388
to distinguish between the two.   Because the private eye    1.5127085093302464
intends to save society in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself    1.6432600607208703
in trouble with the police. The latter are either too stupid to    1.6432600607208703
catch the killer or too corrupt to care. In either case, they do not    1.7026049541338664
appreciate the private detective's zeal. Perry Mason and Hamilton    1.5127085093302464
Burger, Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting    1.5636360329510388
each other than they do in looking for the criminal. Frequently enough,    1.6432600607208703
the police are themselves in league with the killer; Dashiell    1.5636360329510388
Hammett's    1.0
<Red Harvest> provides a classic example of this theme.    1.5127085093302464
But even when the police are honest, they do not trust the private    1.67495327387791
eye. He is, like Phillip Marlowe, too alienated to be reliable. Finally,    1.6432600607208703
in <The Maltese Falcon> among others, the clash between detective    1.5636360329510388
and police is carried to its logical conclusion: Sam Spade    1.5636360329510388
becomes the chief murder suspect. In order to exonerate himself, he    1.6065767145351917
is compelled to find the real criminal, who happens to be his girl friend.    1.7026049541338664
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes    1.6432600607208703
now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of    1.67495327387791
IT IS the growing contradiction    1.1606783668269585
between individualism and public service in the mystery story which    1.5636360329510388
creates this fatal dilemma. By upholding his own personal code of behavior,    1.6432600607208703
the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society    1.6065767145351917
whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption. That society    1.5636360329510388
responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo,    1.67495327387791
a potential criminal. If the detective insists upon retaining his    1.5636360329510388
personal standards, he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society.    1.67495327387791
He must, in short, cease to be a detective and become a rebel.    1.67495327387791
On the other hand, if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession,    1.67495327387791
he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism.    1.6065767145351917
Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write    1.5127085093302464
mystery    1.0
stories and turning to other pursuits. His successors have adopted    1.5636360329510388
the opposite alternative. In order to save the mystery story, they    1.6065767145351917
have converted the private detective into an organization man.   1.5127085093302464
The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by    1.6432600607208703
Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. At first glance, this hero seems    1.5636360329510388
to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors.    1.7026049541338664
For Hammer, nothing is forbidden. He kills when he pleases,    1.5636360329510388
takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge, jury    1.67495327387791
and executioner rolled into one.    1.1606783668269585
It will be shown that the <objectives> of the cooperative people in    1.6432600607208703
an organization determine the type of <network> required, because the    1.5636360329510388
type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages    1.6065767145351917
enumerated in Table 1. Great stress is placed on the role that    1.6432600607208703
the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness    1.5636360329510388
of the network. By monitoring, we mean some system of control    1.6065767145351917
over the types of information sent from the various centers.    1.5636360329510388
As a word of caution, we should be aware that in actual practice no    1.7026049541338664
message is purely one of the four types, question, command, statement,    1.6065767145351917
or exclamation. For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving    1.6432600607208703
a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk, "What    1.67495327387791
time is it"? This sentence would have most of the characteristics    1.6065767145351917
of a question, but it has some of the characteristics of a statement    1.67495327387791
because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in    1.67495327387791
his own timepiece or the one attached to his car. If the man on the    1.7269387314284994
sidewalk is surprised at this question, it has served as an exclamation.    1.6432600607208703
Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer    1.6065767145351917
(and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer) the question    1.6065767145351917
has assumed some measurable properties of a command. However, for    1.5636360329510388
convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified    1.6432600607208703
according to Table 1. On this basis, certain extreme kinds of networks    1.6432600607208703
will be discussed for illustrative purposes.    1.2818970554302986
_THE COCKTAIL PARTY._    1.0
Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire    1.6065767145351917
to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted    1.6065767145351917
and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy    1.6432600607208703
for future cooperative endeavors. The party is usually in a room    1.6065767145351917
small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another.    1.7026049541338664
The information is furnished by each of the guests, is sent by    1.6432600607208703
oral broadcasting over the air waves, and is received by the ears. Since    1.67495327387791
the air is a continuum, the network of communication remains intact    1.6065767145351917
regardless of the positions or motions of the points (the people)    1.6065767145351917
in the net. As shown in Figure 1, there is a connection for communication    1.7026049541338664
between every pair of points. This, and other qualifications, make    1.5636360329510388
the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication    1.5636360329510388
system ever dreamed up. All four types of message listed in Table    1.6432600607208703
1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding    1.5636360329510388
the commands to a minimum, while <exclamations> having complimentary    1.5127085093302464
intonations are more than customarily encouraged. The completeness    1.4513752902486308
of the connections provide that, for ~<N> people, there are **f    1.6065767145351917
lines of communication between the pairs, which can become a large number    1.6432600607208703
(1,225) for a party of fifty guests. Looking at the diagram, we    1.6432600607208703
see that **f connection lines come in to each member. Thus the cocktail    1.67495327387791
party would appear to be the ideal system, but there is one weakness.    1.67495327387791
In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group, the    1.7026049541338664
**f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond    1.6065767145351917
comprehension if ~<N> exceeds about six. The crowd consequently    1.5127085093302464
breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six, with    1.67495327387791
a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.   1.6065767145351917
For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else    1.5636360329510388
and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers, then    1.7026049541338664
the "open house" system is advantageous because the honored guests    1.5636360329510388
are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections    1.6432600607208703
at the door. _THE RURAL COMMUNITY._ We consider a rural    1.5636360329510388
community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration    1.5127085093302464
is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary    1.67495327387791
for family subsistence. We assume for this illustration that the    1.5636360329510388
size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings    1.67495327387791
is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication    1.67495327387791
is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2. Information    1.6065767145351917
beyond nearest neighbor is carried second-, third-, and fourth-hand    1.5127085093302464
as a distortable rumor. In Figure 2, the points in the network are    1.67495327387791
designated by a letter accompanied by a number. The numbers indicate    1.6065767145351917
the number of nearest neighbors. It will be noted that point ~<f>    1.6432600607208703
has seven nearest neighbors, ~<h> and ~<e> have six, and ~<p>    1.6065767145351917
has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate numbers.    1.5636360329510388
In any social system in which communications have an importance    1.5636360329510388
comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point    1.6065767145351917
like ~<f> in Figure 2 would (other things being equal) be the dwelling    1.67495327387791
place for the community leader, while ~<e> and ~<h> would    1.5636360329510388
house the next most important citizens. A point like ~<p> gets    1.6065767145351917
information directly from ~<n>, but all information beyond ~<n>    1.5127085093302464
is indirectly relayed through ~<n>. The dweller at ~<p> is    1.5636360329510388
last to hear about a new cure, the slowest to announce to his neighbors    1.7026049541338664
his urgent distresses, the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the    1.67495327387791
one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or    1.67495327387791
getting people to join him in a cooperative effort. Since the hazards    1.6432600607208703
of poor communication are so great, ~<p> can be justified as a habitable    1.67495327387791
site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made    1.6432600607208703
available by a waterfall for milling purposes, a mine, or a sugar maple    1.67495327387791
camp. Location theorists have given these matters much consideration.    1.5127085093302464
_MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS._ The networks for military communications    1.3761581156320553
are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be    1.67495327387791
changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the    1.67495327387791
addition of new machines of war. They also furnish proof that, in    1.6432600607208703
modern war, message sending must be monitored. Without monitoring, a    1.5636360329510388
military hookup becomes a noisy party. The need for monitoring became    1.6065767145351917
greater when radio was adopted for military signaling. Alexander the    1.5636360329510388
Great, who used runners as message carriers, did not have to worry about    1.67495327387791
having every officer in his command hear what he said and having    1.6432600607208703
hundreds of them comment at once. As time has passed and science has    1.67495327387791
progressed, the speed of military vehicles has increased, the range of    1.6065767145351917
missiles has been extended, the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles    1.6432600607208703
has been adopted, and the range and breadth of message sending    1.6065767145351917
has increased. Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision    1.6432600607208703
making, network structure seems to be paramount, and without monitoring    1.5636360329510388
no network has value.   On the parade ground the net may be similar    1.67495327387791
to that shown in Figure 3. The monitoring is the highest and    1.6432600607208703
most restrictive of any organization in existence. No questions, statements,    1.5636360329510388
or explanations are permitted- only commands. Commands go only    1.5127085093302464
from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank. The same command    1.67495327387791
is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to    1.7026049541338664
corporal. All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and    1.6065767145351917
terminate with action of the men in the ranks. Even the officer in charge,    1.7026049541338664
be it a captain (for small display) or a general, is restrained    1.6432600607208703
by monitoring. This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the    1.67495327387791
hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility.    1.5636360329510388
The commands are specified by the military regulations; are    1.5127085093302464
few in number, briefly worded, all different in sound; and are combinable    1.6432600607208703
into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be    1.5636360329510388
desired on a parade ground. This monitoring is necessary because, on    1.6065767145351917
a parade ground, everyone can hear <too much>, and without monitoring    1.6065767145351917
a confused social event would develop.   With troops dispersed    1.5127085093302464
on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground, it may seem that    1.7026049541338664
a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines    1.6065767145351917
of communication. Years ago this was true, but with the replacement    1.6065767145351917
of wires or runners by radio and radar (and perhaps television), these    1.6432600607208703
restrictions have disappeared and now again <too much> is heard.   1.5636360329510388
In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even    1.4513752902486308
in the field, are more formal. In the extreme and oversimplified example    1.6432600607208703
suggested in Figure 3, the organization is more easily understood    1.5636360329510388
and more predictable in behavior. A military organization has an objective    1.6065767145351917
chosen by the higher command. This objective is adhered to throughout    1.6065767145351917
the duration of the action. The connective system, or network,    1.5636360329510388
is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore    1.67495327387791
not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated    1.6065767145351917
unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college,    1.6065767145351917
