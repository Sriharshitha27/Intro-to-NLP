feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.    104.42072820616167
But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined    63.14750820963775
by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment. In such a case    38.60873236417161
the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied    48.43552589758709
to the issue by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism    89.45239553651562
only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the    237.55502488762625
Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout at Eichmann though he might,    95.49890592112916
the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying    151.59179440384455
the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally    89.5875306410002
recognized category of anti-Semitism. Yes, he believed that the    28.51680555526581
Jews were "enemies of the Reich", and such a belief is, of course,    38.81460165508225
typical of "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the    40.051037395827656
Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member    53.82820695264232
of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The real question was    57.82054728512043
how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer    123.06384759859998
to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In    27.892139379593708
regard to Eichmann,    58.19056734904455
it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained    34.12547266544936
a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a    144.15313185551986
principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent.    124.0440411745578
Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could,    28.240456508557948
as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the    151.1634912436369
Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear of disobeying orders,    236.17888030892797
as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness    82.81345535727024
that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained    40.12865474819684
in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's    118.79022916152837
victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical    39.212579118649586
rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous    58.95311949729282
the better, "Well, let's try it". At any rate, the substance    100.30419798295101
of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from    77.05281108128027
his membership in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor    25.47905228321589
did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success    563.0412762589241
on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to    89.8813751739042
that extent. ##   2.5212542783271643
BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special    68.47149625308158
Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened    123.15510636703365
to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary    151.01218784595306
anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany    149.76530479267691
and wherever else they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial    88.41377745284991
in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis    88.9703765841616
to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the    34.908064046141064
activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified    111.38953544413678
by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites    400.4557936570826
in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary?    48.45799640016726
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January    372.6213742884107
1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death    115.49100585131426
the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was    140.42182114328025
attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including    58.506013273836324
the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in    65.51378353426021
charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the    42.942038459506286
Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The measures for annihilation    98.39059128945371
proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation,    49.01772467226874
civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening the Conference,    78.34448625431878
followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order    84.3403118100805
issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as    169.35646802942463
" a complement to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews    85.27541469521162
from German living space through violence, economic strangulation,    428.00201529342286
forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words, the promulgators    156.76417042112388
of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews    106.6384691051468
was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating    57.79584068839852
in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on    47.39076133020113
the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as    119.64893039078099
a readiness for murder. This, in fact, it turned out to be. Since    31.577482095809103
the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had    73.35892446497972
began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions,    140.93750178582664
and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their    99.8841311458615
tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes; whether    125.026177580147
in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.   70.83718983697315
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn    53.453508196767224
the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the    308.0321554436914
exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp    119.16644892774019
brute? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism    37.06413190860161
of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning    191.51025370894348
of the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had    49.88264268842692
conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent" dislike of Jews,    136.7610661898092
as do others like them today. The Final Solution proved that the    60.849063209170815
Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the    58.77974397462055
criminality and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial have    312.1229569690808
made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how    52.10956251720998
representative types of "mere" anti-Semites were drawn step by    133.47732377417685
step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor    36.766149688129886
in his opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism"    46.48020063618459
among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed". But    287.7220104485913
if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's    109.82038390300781
head    1.0
at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press    143.88376038828133
seems to have missed it. ##   13.590244142869436
NOR DID THE Trial devote much    21.9962772311906
attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis,    51.62774122222442
both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations    115.90557656625933
and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the    47.92616010388123
world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous    106.78115510914864
weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew    85.8929967907118
can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society    89.53605857185393
into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know    119.06013619460899
enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in    71.1841804711303
the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting    153.62916041083636
apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest    281.5893307657918
impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally    74.17492664290504
forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them    89.02722273580719
partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial    136.08429632963598
a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful    89.15576896256398
of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform;    219.86349411659504
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of    76.2202270836922
politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent    184.83277797533884
to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania    340.7703026564519
and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you    127.41766349698001
desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this    99.87110400010977
characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor,    188.040095939705
more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a    36.732544498281186
political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission    39.15935262199497
of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed    120.25017486677716
to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which    34.70973278203716
the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&,    228.406003170524
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it    104.3277722032878
met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria,    890.9243772942635
France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an    74.2553157839627
outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism    38.593197248965375
proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose    32.875552293101414
citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't    200.82571998177437
this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries    42.37344031765551
worth highlighting?    13.73311103240059
##   1.0
AS THE FIRST collective confrontation    8.869227517337976
of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery    118.43772703112938
of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen    235.89474263652357
years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one    70.78196484931148
believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance    113.70303409580603
of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to    104.71644134341362
recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to    35.093679648539364
the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were    81.12744953668853
unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had    51.83910437433765
been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and    87.1295732085945
investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors'    139.07745907855542
accounts.    1.0
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital    51.85698678305222
presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the    254.04185604685208
Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff.    56.035981401812876
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of    191.38671563921883
protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace    23.836793795014696
of the community    4.318550915187204
was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the    72.99672233287419
incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's    22.070195736115704
Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide    147.5107482277608
a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated    135.83819115850244
a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman    324.669321320994
Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board    74.28341639704941
of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year    76.55998410177924
later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an    194.03214149756593
orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood    33.860957077218444
Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were    43.74661991479307
embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's    76.16534882226003
right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents,    114.11882173810157
typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no    81.9754398894705
controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension,    59.43505329139627
rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control    83.93197360532962
issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of    72.44452625302938
newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in    166.05148810523886
municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted    71.62459621162911
on the national level in the matter of including birth-control    50.315907566226976
information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where    61.2914947794632
it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment    251.9802488886011
like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The    25.56061062971595
time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove    61.7363977782307
this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life    86.54714342819503
of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment    32.470564604328054
of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication    71.40193171303146
on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination,    64.75671942914803
loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study    74.75415219374327
of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more    67.19059747337785
serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is    90.10029037329379
reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara,    151.8598276529319
managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over    137.68930939880286
Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the    36.909119884093315
reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their    69.1706995677066
jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed    118.17265231082587
in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly    160.3062740655921
harsh.   1.0
The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-    48.84875901105766
frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-    464.50321462856454
already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the    156.57345051017347
over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being    77.19297598990691
obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number    70.87655624001079
of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible>    162.01867701219803
parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents    304.21584550482595
will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope    51.21290242839259
Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from    17.270335050179764
the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the    37.928130432840696
whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as    75.06006400151139
those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and    55.69827772669968
social "indications". This means that such factors as the health    37.875133221754425
of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their    122.11901873721585
children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density    32.233267553278246
of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately    141.50474996449185
be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.   54.014543741012425
These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics    111.96916886339037
in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control    120.30594604826678
only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however,    33.06253756772757
sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics,    73.93281226069398
Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of    120.41124541237689
family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman    66.97407125761929
Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also    245.41127077966075
known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers    53.493472759615756
this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author:    65.53245872851355
It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent    385.1011220874447
and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman    23.029795193375836
Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no    131.2267803406758
moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives,    265.7289107348241
allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in    51.33283169988739
theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The    99.49833394562275
grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament),    90.81799871681736
the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the    29.08686542001257
unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest    122.79695241440619
ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent    42.451546104373755
role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive,    40.732193686025106
entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of    120.01197369969293
birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition    61.67685684539733
regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of    58.10487890717673
the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual    134.01478407873603
love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion    87.95038363215939
is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason    46.888589654766996
can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known    72.0762638109337
His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus,    186.8696309721778
man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal    48.57503523246422
act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man    117.17917014102544
may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by    255.82479221253385
God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for    105.77935167670951
the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this    24.406855236926454
law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are    51.28079259497098
obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let    475.5302665323964
it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between    65.50794515134497
Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But    31.545334880299787
people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without    111.43427766942263
taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it    106.85183644934348
so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has    106.97573673172484
sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation    294.9699887978157
and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical    53.52166198522448
consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation    77.58905323266313
for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant    247.7451548591385
one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint    104.58857003338555
upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed    178.66625715589083
to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during    31.82518368607815
World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the    63.86489944901257
Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe    86.1982937953149
that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically    138.45836284340092
evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants    293.3832950009979
forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general    116.04757813919453
public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that    46.859764046722866
the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt    74.90432216990676
to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers,    223.7391715279011
hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled    149.12628898921247
in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an    99.88853846543526
inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience    291.85340738272356
shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced    44.33651710476023
when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.    37.802889192791966
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control    74.55419629961347
today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned    34.44422051072897
by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary    239.3382204385052
to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian    38.82498607120149
countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches    20.660681962202972
stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth    214.13744152317938
Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual    76.98595956463942
change that has taken place among Protestants generally.    29.63240375674534
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception    447.04759648696466
and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural    42.86919851019167
means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers-    62.41540273811761
physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against    70.05990986715113
the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing    243.632738684976
the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference    42.30870672316419
declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded    125.5712927353341
as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the    77.88279105250662
primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance    225.99924121483966
of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is    83.40963530159368
the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful    117.28764524906767
self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against    39.44284345798408
the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth    196.16584730274255
Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be    96.56410577157584
the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances,    66.05266180727928
contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958,    50.80067241037956
the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by    88.57341556231698
God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations    142.54281266292315
preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out    187.49853629481757
of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified    41.00561984470395
artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity",    42.345836808390146
the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the    40.28646534423589
size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control    91.95577540422322
of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement    76.77243718654447
also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression    181.3468774498096
of mutual affection <without> relation to procreation is right".   121.62085831669347
Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate    166.5071252034264
pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared    63.17633633582144
it at times to be a <religious duty>. What determines the morality,    211.66708767411419
they state, is not the <means> used, but the <motive>. In    60.86415465620574
general, the means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective are    333.6008285880839
considered the most ethical.   This development is reflected in    46.43974279195188
the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the    58.03224542040043
National    1.0
Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the    24.883679837624516
~US. The board approved and commended the use of birth-control    131.48439902962153
devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning. It    75.68489113718168
called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting    263.50071570275566
the information or availability of contraceptives.   The general    61.105252197594886
board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception    94.39883482416589
and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are    87.6823778807827
right **h. The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather    79.81593890262084
than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are    172.32238886625385
limited to the prevention of conception".   An action once universally    157.57764667622183
condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil    111.80141384670328
law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant    49.96332445584677
denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive    94.0086945285481
<religious duty>. This viewpoint has now been translated into    94.56105387775933
action by the majority of people in this country. Repeated polls have    28.68982666857022
disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the    118.32056921833062
practice of birth control.   For all concerned with social-welfare    169.05620441593211
legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary    30.239289521417817
change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American    21.370726597185385
people is clear, profound and far-reaching. To try to oppose the general    96.66848034726873
religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative    101.08869091376609
fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was    66.54864931516313
occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.   This brings    174.63510735170092
us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in    33.88133905389221
the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion:    71.65105022012612
They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.    113.2903539910547
Conscience and religion are concerned with private <sin:> The civil    184.31043162447773
law is concerned with public <crimes>. Only confusion, failure    97.73017321265965
and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority    127.57770482104293
the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the    180.78944124417484
possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived    113.31511994699386
imposition would be religion itself.    23.697702011634856
##   1.0
On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, <Discovery>,    170.7346335774426
weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool, London, and    111.79828176261948
floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain,    319.78964457037006
a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration    97.70833797041233
of the Arctic waters of North America.   Seventeen months later,    109.55718562166774
on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the <Discovery>    496.2742082080216
limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port,    503.08161638789534
she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The    140.45847019788172
captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded    114.29849929079194
her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.   What disaster    158.39641706500913
struck the <Discovery> during those seventeen months? What happened    186.8625584091221
to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained    125.55305366455477
one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the    23.307430822885543
evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal,    71.91266473546078
(2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note    64.90594779516871
found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand    147.52982678124874
reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture.   But    87.32352285074035
since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal    220.38939422908993
files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not    45.85280376292925
enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate    48.632023646771245
picture of the events of the voyage.   Historians have had    27.223209091377647
two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First,    57.86509657042942
they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed    228.87003537347482
it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose    29.147613744769558
name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties,    226.52150279667185
on a great American river, and on half a million square miles    94.93839025057294
of Arctic seas.   The name: <Henry Hudson>.   This    143.2120514041653
is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or    81.45114378484398
ever, probably, will be able- to determine:   The sailing in    18.24762900268037
the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time    37.03503058496414
his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western    134.60448799346096
Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy    30.300288115211444
Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole    117.75934140914694
or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy    62.41818992491755
Company indicated it would not back him again.   In 1609, the    41.61022179022503
Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers,    555.0751875620987
fitted him out with a ship called the <Half Moon>, and supplied    74.79104662989405
him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the    96.35447231025927
middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important-    222.0869092064963
the Great North (later, the Hudson) River- but it produced    56.8913523869342
no northwest passage. ##   11.744865181405016
When the <Half Moon> put in at    43.774554141251265
Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings    19.34727586293476
leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government    50.17656902769429
forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went    146.36936124098625
to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime,    158.57076620224672
he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage    62.295636611543706
of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran    251.03460628922173
ship called the <Discovery> and had recruited a crew of twenty-one,    61.43720933040523
the largest he had ever commanded.   The purpose of this    69.08642083019643
fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that    158.5995770193557
a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe    83.2357925721442
and    1.0
the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a    90.26663682277442
passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's    269.4571133800901
sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.   74.95567164283105
But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to    185.36771879559632
the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had    276.80028018962213
noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the    117.80809379265756
water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He    172.7231963442483
named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious    459.3969442905209
Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)   45.36707038610461
In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little <Discovery> that    24.520188730164797
Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his    276.51614802274827
frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all    384.3961342723709
the    1.0
way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.   121.51966760909947
Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he    229.6862225790647
was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous,    225.61711567079902
ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely    138.6439002455002
such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.    154.40329738232438
On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of    58.58335940436901
Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that    401.4712645395362
he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case. On    86.62780250659058
the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch    187.87660483751932
and English crew members on the <Half Moon> had almost forced him    83.7038355283557
to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.   Worse,    234.67748134546403
his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before. Of    127.46057456595744
only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son. The    249.470604537848
mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the <half Moon>,    152.20708513555243
was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or    95.36583304562805
desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was    238.29621492025308
a good worker, but perversely independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael    394.22656296922554
Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson    198.45672323590176
in a crisis.   But men willing to sail at all into waters where    159.07840979450043
wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find. Hudson    200.42105258276789
knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer. And    56.819879593005034
he refused to be anything else.   It is believed that Hudson    46.48615780890169
was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was    44.6259928169885
trained    1.0
on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with three sons.    98.51450186785684
(The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name    53.927590828606554
was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.) In 1610,    161.481323933976
Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn    178.02977305724104
voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.    196.48834080600554
##   1.0
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a    103.01343626589345
few miles down the Thames. There at the river's edge waited one Henry    171.77196033166047
Greene, whom Hudson listed as a "clerk". Greene was in actuality    132.9750392378163
a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in    184.08937416114034
order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores.    223.08321497635094
He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board    143.06522230429945
and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the <Discovery> picked    141.06990110348144
him up.   For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the    32.625983171930265
east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward. On May 11, she    256.2860073771578
reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the    150.14464569861178
crew called "Lousie Bay". The subsequent two-weeks wait made the    356.51383819676244
crew quarrelsome. With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked    246.6532682569921
a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue was    108.86075738024047
settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined    421.41519959579995
to catch the next fishing boat back to England. With difficulty,    72.10214180648063
Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.    493.9771457580072

Early in June, the <Discovery> passed "Desolation"    301.60562767697
(southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall".    155.07395636987448
Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog hung    184.3425782775531
over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.    184.28489036987924
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic    56.11939685505547
North Pole.   As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was    174.94984798483304
forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the    166.49844314693138
great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he    209.36454414731526
turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the    111.63422347212929
crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.   The trouble    193.85695356029572
was at least partly Juet's doing. For weeks he had been saying that    66.66939491426025
Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd. The great,    192.9104517133907
crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice    140.14878737170315
of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would    99.00660193989398
sail no farther.   Instead of quelling the dissension, as many    199.75773137419313
captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's    170.19189616839398
head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable.    119.08124400432449
He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which    93.21434886207108
he set up in view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew    38.927500157453565
about their course and their objectives.   When Hudson had finished,    159.1712016256318
the "town meeting" broke down into a general, wordy    26.69028264262911
argument.    1.0
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety    57.11405492710636
of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who    102.94699816036
said he wouldn't give <ten> pounds to be home. The statement was    169.8242656861359
effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson was free to sail on. ##    329.4743173926463
All through July the <Discovery> picked her way along the 450-mile-long    288.542160111099
strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands. On August 3, two massive    218.86083140703457
headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before,    58.988064237448434
so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape    186.85510474889648
a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands    193.93774099931227
of screaming sea birds. To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind    302.96822023172274
to a precipice of 2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and    174.61088974060146
Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.   Hudson pointed the <Discovery>    101.37671416629166
down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called    103.82943475217144
Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the    45.741507166227
Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered    96.0187529363503
an area of shallow marshes and river deltas. The ship halted. The    169.7782752709859
great "sea to the westwards" was a dead end.   This must have    40.49719570308342
been Hudson's blackest discovery. For he seemed to sense at once    153.7246272881045
that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North    79.09406970269379
American continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to    93.90908118531841
know he was destined to failure.   Feverishly, he tried to brush    58.0103907695767
away this intuition. North and south, east and west, back and forth    45.273682605102245
he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land    349.33235694541685
appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after    103.10080419169766
week. Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England    52.98954711025797
through the "Furious Overfall" was again filling with ice.   372.30767988285845
The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking.    133.68738551527875
Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest. Hudson's reply    138.114561193503
was to accuse the mate of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove    433.50113653112413
his charges in an open trial.   The trial was held September    51.39750746395989
10. Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony    519.9218563408797
from crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men    187.75494171244475
stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe    463.0161481195101
swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords    144.4201651394886
in their cabins. Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted    444.42780508767186
bloodshed on the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the    54.24364636194532
ship homeward.   Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new    214.16610153422124
mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There were other    251.68875151599977
shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.    67.96870439751154
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis    69.20542903429401
Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.   357.0784844204127
As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little    155.94526877191387
bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him. Once,    257.83026408834644
after the <Discovery> lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered    165.76098988679436
the anchor raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being    68.89447856921586
hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and Adame Moore    563.5067846711585
were thrown off the capstan and badly injured. The anchor cable would    349.21753912140844
have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever    232.20976088837173
it with his axe.   13.35736622677751
Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian    981.795300340026
Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands,    31.930934220786312
conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River    59.094512277879254
of the North. Since the land he desired lay within the great northern    121.53882712670601
empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of    134.616561089719
the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies. Having    122.8544325611064
achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the    49.5400176566887
valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched    172.08558561194258
southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red- was    166.04038594217712
made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots    70.99180383375764
was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus    201.30800653448838
at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify    129.36000226067986
the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle    158.32965563136167
of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the    65.14995308086641
center of the North American continent to the west of the American    32.76601904462441
agricultural frontier.   Seven hundred miles south of York Factory,    126.7863237815597
at "the Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three    79.15210090553298
men located a settlement in August 1812. By October the little    212.62796871000748
colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg) numbered 100. Within    474.5555118016928
a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring    155.0849379354003
the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called <Meurons>.    82.54459489649936
The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported    213.59047879659485
by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the    42.783434887795515
War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of    135.2450090853323
the war in 1815. Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go    64.81797749235085
to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect    60.98730425342481
his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the    85.330112961906
intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries    250.8419141484016
were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of    151.75643731332755
the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as    106.83084543732684
1818.   It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages    69.30895220572351
of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement    76.7024580290177
southward. When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was    74.55340201016836
assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and <metis> moved up    166.14554496720947
the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built huts and    148.83375997387034
a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland.    599.8836747029361
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer    574.8737252880264
to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for    120.67159203220538
food.   The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move    166.82717078583002
southward by British fur traders. For many years the Northwest Company    150.10766165114268
had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi    76.70771846707258
River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul,    73.14628077985813
Minnesota. When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm    91.73236498055515
out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American    93.04787581512485
citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly-    611.0065860577165
continued in the fur business. On Big Stone Lake near the    100.0881589961922
headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of    44.442812857956206
the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned    163.48102600737965
in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small    123.56358915837225
artillery pieces. His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks    204.1118040811933
of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south    67.71767460786056
in carts. These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days    167.5852904994876
of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk    245.20279731683863
colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new carts" as    108.06971021178462
being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as    47.33407263153635
a horse could pack. They were held together by pegs and withes and    150.62399556226543
in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.   It was Dickson    257.17194660606646
who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast    96.6142828454448
by way of the United States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina)    71.73899068421413
Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux,    96.20386019184487
he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the trip Selkirk decided    83.14843639775502
that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern    168.198928660802
United States was the best route for goods from England to reach    150.76283472505773
Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply    24.716595416259864
for many goods than either Canada or England. Upon arriving at    144.8480688598973
Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams,    162.3778049339893
Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade    134.70780983184488
with "Missouri and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he    93.21958223311243
declared prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at first,    95.46691209311726
would increase with the progress of our Settlements **h".    53.78961326499041
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop    79.91430881785219
into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might    92.60492037709331
have expected. In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the    58.24318842621748
Forks" (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort    183.62810649894254
Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien.    43.1849865816077
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three    72.61837403443528
months of labor on Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice    263.04478137351174
gone from the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river)    93.84443352833172
their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels    427.8779673413612
of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats    111.22103352896801
and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse,    436.06278849807114
and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820. This    245.17655502506705
epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk @1,040.    96.24009925534592
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were    146.93165365687204
forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became    757.7946806922472
more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.   50.84521874585878
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony    110.39280595155496
on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send    153.55469878810723
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post    256.84954921239637
300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien, until then the most advanced    34.8404824229131
United States post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry    164.28831856893692
arrived at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of navigation    41.24116889020293
on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St&    139.20445617367625
Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander,    224.10734279564724
Colonel Josiah Snelling.   It was from the American outposts    88.66964196498004
that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules    74.38379780527299
L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted    471.7325938359279
to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and    61.95216694557765
Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers. Bailly,    759.0707031494214
after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave    184.36482514142585
some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake    123.51192036508971
Traverse "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the    86.93544291284103
Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the    179.72502375649816
fall. He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families    126.48070226440744
of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward    241.67629993763487
the United States. Observing their distressing condition, Colonel    65.20517662097596
Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military    267.8751214534285
reservation.   As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk    126.06014028691042
settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman    93.41910242192343
of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du Chien was traveling    121.23331467985649
to Red River to open a trade in merchandise. Early in 1822 he was    113.90399126848601
at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.    125.75936767570907
Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird,    138.92144825181734
a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such "sundry    305.1164457945658
articles" to a value of @4,500.   For its part the Hudson's    90.28578134273972
Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement.    61.023458030475474
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier    57.85113378977003
by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the    26.02480115778451
Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer- was on American    178.4615186040231
territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move    280.20358126639735
north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating    196.39120226218307
the timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything",    93.70185398374518
he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment    37.06350769080679
**h". Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut    141.27087360870186
off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350    412.29570424930864
persons stayed in the village. They would attempt to bring supplies    48.731682026887015
from St& Louis or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well    85.85119029317242
as danger".   At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided    81.76892228859231
to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families    40.29536988222496
paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling. The disasters of 1825-1826    209.17059828316556
caused more to leave. After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice,    253.10313163533718
snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through    70.89108881787223
a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick. In April    214.24719084573852
came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until    267.61711462927207
mid-June. On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month    120.72291452599482
trip across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443 survivors    81.01212436892021
of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but    316.4854271924582
most of them were sent on to Galena and St& Louis, with a few going    59.99967686210538
as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United    58.36961036241858
States. In 1837, 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were    50.50707707391443
living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.   Below the fort,    75.31481924407821
high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi    195.76196038783948
River. At the point where they ended, another settlement grew    84.48172594085706
up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier    173.2945967545533
in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American    119.40398551628776
Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were    165.48160786344388
joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major    206.5198345089499
Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840.    90.17200715279682
The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father    113.28174199871671
Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become an important center    177.82237829458634
of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers    69.90378003394184
who remained at Red River.   While population at Fort    134.9513861901509
Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic    134.9483416527001
opportunities did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though    59.60743229965729
the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter    120.36283429090828
which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the    262.75302488308563
Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade. The Company    233.4574450714316
maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased    226.0843632618164
and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they    50.00567271771669
refrain from trading in furs. Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some    331.6992851083933
of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs.    362.63537973653865
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed    177.11557671352418
a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed    348.0850458902839
as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power".    24.924933408798903
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's    101.36943525397598
local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding    397.33258127227094
any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source    105.99739817642032
of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men    216.44047895048428
to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried    94.34707054455981
pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St&    220.70376327737986
Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells,    48.36680811492564
transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This    195.97986470248176
trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835,    53.8058748666087
but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty    127.18782919952041
was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.   43.202308983820124
The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow    117.36031974867298
in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel.    50.28748718195083
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer    131.9105024802549
humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in    27.955897634053535
the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some    69.41950362519694
of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate    140.71991229504357
observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen    149.32399138263855
and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were    159.6646508339879
"in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house".    144.54312944946096
A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".   172.73570928520013
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One    167.98855806976036
wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse +    258.22228726587963
snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses    84.94942716763146
in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times".    102.29733476468972
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved    224.1012292400041
about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches    341.45407754266597
on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity    125.51072762822628
of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and    328.5514819916094
sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following    185.29444355887634
description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse    103.40622397879736
girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h    110.62241808605624
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from    285.2362317297057
the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression.    300.1343870843417
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become    81.22125023167906
of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my    136.5991028536503
love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell,    580.1641664217152
an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved    768.7771798646969
in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked    174.9999930546754
to    1.0
tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about    31.340340921281854
a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive    88.5957617100206
letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married    48.97467689825177
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar    138.3992321213519
as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as    187.83182636158048
I am    1.8803231973311911
so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote:    149.93104002282834
"I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another    181.95109112471675
Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down    418.8135963401997
to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite    241.21073425403577
before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"".    404.2435193073676
Charles    1.0
Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his    171.51032091467314
comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation,    32.92834343437626
well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like    46.59943839739474
his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his    89.25590432985105
service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups,    116.7862291819909
name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and    23.847975544064802
then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and    87.77343251868842
'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file    92.75912902009749
of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and    116.09037680264835
wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most    29.647286203086356
common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities    293.7363892716189
referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but    92.6496508531046
a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier    121.20715538440433
stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough    100.00499452130809
as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs    175.2208334984192
from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer    155.29939797236494
to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering    223.41676968124258
from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier    209.56842021216485
gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence    32.69429084601313
of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three    173.72496993284042
days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack    148.26706568479577
and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother:    167.59985087872062
"I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear    141.41026477184573
and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters    163.40995948724176
which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances.    385.31680345685197
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers    394.1263319376189
rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of    85.72780403035311
the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of    98.04613895042759
bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of    62.72750917946432
the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many    380.7104549240723
Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing    160.3982979102651
from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the    43.986195940256216
sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously    188.45722443702041
written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing    930.9452198832341
about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863,    153.48336740631683
stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced    242.71979420144137
writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we    77.56076126980054
take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed    392.6973300933667
his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often    78.0402176440182
**h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just    57.545681297311255
count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every    270.3572018927125
time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta    315.67618931328064
reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they    89.70442752000193
will knock over my ink, so I will close". #/3,#   119.16674835251288
The most    1.7603010763131075
common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But    60.90872119457687
fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and    133.98792058734247
these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing    105.46772163184468
of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include    263.4798483038404
in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro    116.97343505411075
community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the    54.796172627453984
war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro    181.46467703362532
"body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging,    147.67302943931475
cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.    300.17781378076296
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters    333.62638052738464
of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members    99.29840268435453
of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on    102.46749088550699
correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages    212.73561620190713
characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were    247.27004696499884
stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally    125.51747699180608
gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about    576.8782268672221
their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or    270.1987445579199
Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier    269.322411139411
whose    1.0
feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully    153.07608182954095
of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout    236.67939244638544
I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it    137.94822081544876
all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five    68.84518032381257
of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I    264.00152315958445
recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they    40.511277342738246
would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk".    85.81565657928087
Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who,    125.90949541347022
from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment    167.53485883084895
on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself    128.7745924965282
thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was    268.01332780701114
a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having    100.42823392322474

helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as    159.62087216384853
i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from    366.25306199893294
soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions.    174.57343600502358
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his    39.288345769706766
first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting    438.06460035564044
yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they    60.450379379052514

and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit    315.3962700220573
Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers    34.747502447740295
in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi    183.1557969263812
soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain,    201.56913455275924
stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry    473.35840866002934
is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation    142.00441111488877
of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to    127.8446815001454
tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H&    237.76561727449362
Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees    348.56876980796875
from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a    55.32279194279987
private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton    203.94198747567657
and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head    56.01198792906305

**h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow    201.5686026562914
their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point    28.684372694062407
graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments    101.24167658110322
about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.    29.065574480242223
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War    25.420027038157862
version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves    102.61273669969484
as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks    48.0979888688422
**h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten    125.26490661571596
cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George    99.51615566043476
Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My    121.94133274345509
own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended    67.52931793566984
long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I    363.55518764683274
wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging    171.87475390690813
them against [the other half]".   No group of officers    31.849360331955108
came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal    81.59480829307032
soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde    279.27539632387067
with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after    178.10131033998042
the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank    158.32868481260905
wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital    120.99973071738657
for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed-    83.38618632250605
thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union    157.97619883557428
quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward    163.71844122017077
each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut    75.35153776051772
of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to    189.74316284486468
a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey    92.87822135467691
+ gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier    71.26238054579261
wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw    87.96461386654849
they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h".    47.73471891287912
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote    217.7640893787096
in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right    105.01954119718054

with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would    340.1095030793797
be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing    207.94321452455455
from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama    114.19013733027583
Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that    13.875701755346345

THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION    127.77973061104119
to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism    137.7440825620806
in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence    37.356994377268215
across the world. Thus, if we are to observe American folklore    82.98443256075093
in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships    54.95005343687913
between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.   115.7638951281237
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism    162.5786584465559
and international influence. 1) Every age rewrites the events    140.61193157619857
of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends    60.15218537867838
about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary    89.6734523852606
actions. What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important    86.89173769223518
as what a given generation feels must have occurred. 2) As a country    82.50487815056084
superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches    202.58677551507014
its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness. Its folklore    276.72310003325083
and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account    225.62628758236997
for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to    95.33343740832565
become a cohesive force for national identification.   One can apply    162.11467437521364
these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries    157.46015063965174
as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be    240.36558340686926
applied again to the United States in more recent years. The popularity    37.8713713425873
of local color literature before the Spanish-American War, the    86.92878569819395
steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the    72.20098346610361
frontier west in our mass media are cases in point. Nor is it an accident    153.11844752500153
that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years,    39.22894917615627
has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such    61.60649582995396
as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical    19.996779627718627
Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature,    93.21515334947706
American civilization, American anything have swept our school    255.90617059365167
and college curricula.   Of course, nationalism has really    76.94791445306973
outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its    152.90493349180167
continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the    58.26285352881146
twentieth-century    1.0
United States. Yet nationalism has lost few of its    88.23873225144112
charms for the historian, writer or man in the street. It is an understandable    50.19664263780325
paradox that most American history and most American literature    32.67269220598119
is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic    276.4257025384747
point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion    74.57060575857675
over palm and pine. After all, the average American as he lies and    108.52089419116994
waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain    308.56621525861163
hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or    61.66495810579981
her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental    118.03942830087279
actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.    80.65284678761873
Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether    18.893038838582175
warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense    357.2453349030888
emotional involvement. Such identification comes for each group in each    163.66071910430256
crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate    516.0885091982335
national heroes.   In America, such self-deception has served    60.72764301508988
a particularly useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed it    207.5712317353404
to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and    80.31023714387348
ever-changing    1.0
land. But we must never forget, most of the appropriate    33.44665703979143
heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs,    204.7947978478991
almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson Weems's George    324.3889256265894
Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of    24.4127806815259
the uniting States. Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of    154.40287927792716
the national Constitution. Robert E& Lee represented the dignity    133.06525865741392
needed by a rebelling confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by    53.95303570083705
those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett,    613.6986899009155
Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.   Therefore, the    65.6001741531702
scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years,    51.670673856683614
will be mindful of two facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created    69.73156002313507
to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are    228.16621232773608
not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that an "American national    66.14532608599944
folklore" exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.   211.96074820591042
Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group    183.08967776145454
of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission. It    299.0900828040215
has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions,    692.9232013217819
rhymes and such literary forms of expression. Related to    79.4542419141309
written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written    149.3496414789054
form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral    241.23311451434657
existence. Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies,    115.08097993367755
it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.   160.1604164728923
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our    328.7528679299681
folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as    153.76885436055224
this. Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus    576.6151437276478
materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor    687.0230920772225
union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition. Nor    196.48745173354405
have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of    51.63583527408439
isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did    162.6680912057505
not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education    139.58126748410854
and industrialization    1.387739696376632
had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as    59.757903937911124
a means of carrying culturally significant material.   Naturally,    93.05914123950839
such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make    47.824376952015136
money or fan patriotism by means of folklore. That much of what he    84.81880487160853
calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people    60.75799817289167
with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction    160.04688081260605
to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant. As long    100.25223115334566
as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses    97.89631470144677
and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains satisfied.   136.1810444625277
From all this we can now see that two streams of development    45.91785762793946
run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore. On    73.02838991892078
the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained    53.73936050011626
in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected    91.82910693941216
and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic,    90.16157682912197
regional and occupational groups that make up this nation. On the other    122.48562454697556
we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been    26.605946837005597
willing to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial material    226.83977302934713
willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists (writers, movie    39.20588475592213
producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore    158.98997107232282
since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams    37.80658121500493
even in the most general of ways. After all, the field is large, difficult    64.74030023940011
to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates.    148.32074158481882
In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many    79.50011778521596
heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of    84.00968169659961
print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society.    243.6074426614597
The problems confuse even the experts.   For that matter,    63.453085266887825
the experts themselves are a mixed breed. Anthropologists, housewives,    204.44937482594992
historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline    139.96072033445955
as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination    370.730073849923
of the four. They have widely varying backgrounds and aims.    245.70834003082373
They have little "esprit de corps".   The outlook for the    30.343683525960927
amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local    51.47215478260482
history or for the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism    74.2095645016473
in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.    89.70332240757524
Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain    214.84997477998704
as such. The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is    113.81134098261076
actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field. The collector    28.817588443121092
enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the    89.56287693836396
very "field and stream" reasons that many persons hunt game; and    105.24139661823257
only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has    43.815565562451006
located. Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector,    197.1732362151789
are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between    71.17250888604946
real folklore and bogus material.   But there are also the commercial    53.33152843120831
propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other    34.01488875244135
by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are primarily concerned    116.09624756795507
with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector    67.08049444526714
has found. Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond    90.13311607244081
the sewage system and the electric light lines. The commercial propagandist,    112.88212041417381
who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the    54.9732289747348
amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's    68.49329124670295
toes by refusing to keep his material genuine. His standards are,    128.33223891976212
