feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism.    587.3059135350537
But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined    538.5943170197061
by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment. In such a case    142.96103314031234
the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied    236.10361131234856
to the issue by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism    1121.3005043819535
only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the    758.2805486302778
Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout at Eichmann though he might,    367.8179307886326
the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying    749.8227134875249
the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally    422.18304230110084
recognized category of anti-Semitism. Yes, he believed that the    82.80900439467642
Jews were "enemies of the Reich", and such a belief is, of course,    197.05320892568645
typical of "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the    146.91778134671125
Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member    255.70018494792927
of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The real question was    256.8806605697617
how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer    471.01689836862386
to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In    75.48490546266395
regard to Eichmann,    148.49364922547534
it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained    173.43721457396902
a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a    1066.2065120823324
principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent.    1248.5630808274004
Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could,    114.19418903388548
as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the    575.2167042477558
Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear of disobeying orders,    1467.652889149246
as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness    1183.596230138585
that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained    443.2629709354961
in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's    434.71014052099724
victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical    309.05672793479033
rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous    376.8890887454644
the better, "Well, let's try it". At any rate, the substance    550.2589776533125
of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from    679.7313981393977
his membership in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor    150.8432959404171
did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success    3565.684680003914
on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to    779.3654292746093
that extent. ##   2.4662392677107627
BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special    257.2447743700109
Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened    539.2823877949729
to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary    1036.918372868099
anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany    413.28893862787714
and wherever else they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial    243.25628492488275
in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis    664.0473678406316
to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the    155.9779291931889
activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified    434.7502251075882
by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites    3585.067624109374
in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary?    185.26818321514966
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January    1484.6287668261396
1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death    259.49954469501404
the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was    685.3784593872077
attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including    301.67761788111534
the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in    407.51308837524334
charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the    154.72061136814776
Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The measures for annihilation    556.078454827704
proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation,    255.58591674524718
civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening the Conference,    189.96091804609182
followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order    420.88060981765693
issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as    1086.4625578298999
" a complement to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews    693.4883516439776
from German living space through violence, economic strangulation,    1922.681500349176
forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words, the promulgators    476.12971568516053
of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews    1308.1650557761907
was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating    486.2960447472481
in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on    194.7500205069336
the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as    1644.9658675675103
a readiness for murder. This, in fact, it turned out to be. Since    119.92822371603629
the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had    528.5674033869772
began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions,    732.3794126071663
and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their    485.5899415175233
tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes; whether    1093.8280415588326
in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.   529.1551417798232
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn    124.47143808381253
the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the    921.3783435829517
exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp    1083.5314412425018
brute? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism    260.96320370053115
of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning    1232.1314871642062
of the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had    303.75374042952194
conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent" dislike of Jews,    394.2501048452083
as do others like them today. The Final Solution proved that the    183.93098513911934
Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the    253.96416543129564
criminality and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial have    1052.416387391694
made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how    309.5535136408629
representative types of "mere" anti-Semites were drawn step by    407.0817065228522
step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor    412.6245030867642
in his opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism"    389.6309657091872
among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed". But    2342.620001941641
if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's    1752.6318312289739
head    1.0
at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press    964.7380514037128
seems to have missed it. ##   46.85845046989323
NOR DID THE Trial devote much    100.80540822333055
attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis,    261.93314531463847
both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations    999.2401451410348
and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the    298.9269101958765
world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous    505.2379240078116
weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew    398.08324328227997
can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society    245.71629903758216
into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know    599.0391865533743
enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in    339.37102651007535
the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting    2344.7843402074645
apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest    1848.780547487638
impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally    113.13403298929838
forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them    328.43327595707063
partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial    716.0183065920612
a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful    310.26526120103335
of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform;    5125.71326312314
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of    439.439710901133
politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent    1406.8666181900783
to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania    4993.163861690055
and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you    635.5585993230549
desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this    221.74170739115297
characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor,    976.2203440678348
more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a    285.9477019721807
political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission    113.02780057456197
of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed    481.9973242651101
to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which    145.07400526935012
the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&,    2515.1390518821922
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it    167.38043001511025
met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria,    5185.715661434226
France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an    259.927817888305
outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism    169.49513031767174
proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose    119.21664103322624
citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't    949.884612594151
this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries    157.21175374561307
worth highlighting?    15.207790449926444
##   1.0
AS THE FIRST collective confrontation    84.2229839697149
of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery    950.6730920285786
of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen    2707.9560663708144
years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one    442.1898081634353
believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance    682.512140175875
of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to    836.2068938214119
recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to    48.33015003057183
the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were    262.29958014976756
unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had    302.6209230207751
been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and    687.98779016796
investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors'    960.1593557065639
accounts.    1.0
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital    155.08176216867267
presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the    496.4448202215275
Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff.    289.3573209527184
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of    1350.9498121152878
protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace    43.52066076966295
of the community    5.391802838407035
was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the    218.61211278003574
incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's    29.60024118304568
Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide    297.7721056516387
a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated    829.3347050856331
a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman    1507.7934955908393
Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board    212.55257686253123
of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year    326.58791151271254
later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an    788.4635979222061
orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood    72.55564053651877
Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were    124.20572696629078
embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's    342.0953054270533
right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents,    707.9215542229409
typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no    349.414635360742
controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension,    339.0655321228543
rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control    289.2123265315411
issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of    507.93856335145983
newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in    721.7215351500391
municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted    712.7351181040519
on the national level in the matter of including birth-control    137.69718703091152
information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where    255.48465526961888
it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment    4030.34103901022
like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The    28.89790756655042
time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove    185.22139117426468
this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life    320.5793968724722
of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment    48.606204376353304
of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication    487.04888687775
on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination,    875.9455052773723
loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study    215.38208536710613
of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more    518.7106991707078
serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is    143.64856114007375
reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara,    1004.9530079819158
managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over    626.8037057367964
Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the    139.0489995364838
reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their    172.36440993243627
jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed    325.1364181663866
in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly    1649.1125572550754
harsh.   1.0
The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-    191.42234592177576
frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-    3673.739290180232
already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the    596.2683739422547
over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being    273.3352707017339
obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number    321.52772829803337
of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible>    791.0765031102754
parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents    1809.5357585907022
will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope    575.3569284898474
Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from    51.69471191044
the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the    71.83740550877232
whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as    302.06527959254515
those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and    226.34997506187455
social "indications". This means that such factors as the health    68.45062149967261
of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their    812.8432495935489
children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density    63.715539551842234
of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately    663.914856785142
be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.   177.46004364839106
These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics    565.0094162096648
in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control    495.7892703498697
only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however,    93.73675383803922
sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics,    589.9592548811204
Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of    304.90219304262985
family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman    133.3976753632841
Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also    1894.1995930508995
known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers    324.19288594411665
this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author:    267.4632638309038
It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent    1420.57669790796
and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman    29.279052638299298
Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no    597.9007322926345
moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives,    2333.8449322296105
allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in    184.98128935501774
theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The    300.87566018882023
grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament),    422.5505780729948
the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the    43.30992137199279
unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest    202.16014890803257
ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent    86.4376990860422
role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive,    257.73051115678396
entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of    243.90971571354353
birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition    244.75663209606103
regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of    228.57966965718305
the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual    607.0178942267202
love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion    1081.4221453263729
is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason    154.1207662821263
can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known    374.48373029400136
His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus,    1741.2000163212697
man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal    233.32746795579692
act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man    1144.1248635318225
may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by    1550.4612199602338
God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for    379.76825410953325
the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this    82.24311042353568
law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are    180.98161252119877
obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let    4112.031751148889
it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between    327.12905349233074
Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But    226.68693485718032
people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without    930.0393967566346
taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it    300.40018259783307
so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has    887.6490534295888
sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation    1885.7454789206529
and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical    201.19685943092017
consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation    275.91994965157085
for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant    3662.7701165740996
one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint    714.5550046122039
upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed    1237.5049433876102
to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during    179.45636012133428
World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the    180.12307964141237
Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe    494.012642658163
that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically    1011.3457767437731
evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants    2875.402987971001
forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general    347.3400809936536
public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that    282.0509709716147
the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt    123.81480552510607
to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers,    4474.898754631963
hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled    492.0773577758542
in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an    439.99418174297165
inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience    1149.3664462590332
shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced    210.8742031625518
when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.    158.44417568634313
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control    251.20897334675
today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned    119.24487125943949
by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary    2716.117510162909
to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian    207.44205444713904
countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches    32.99271657236496
stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth    1233.8129655358528
Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual    200.92654926006074
change that has taken place among Protestants generally.    74.1620009472252
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception    5435.662472950616
and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural    405.6534699190118
means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers-    574.3359706976382
physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against    350.1012542003378
the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing    1543.255829099299
the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference    158.9567014150177
declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded    281.91491734594337
as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the    355.15307924476076
primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance    1420.051287939923
of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is    613.3283422074838
the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful    886.5051652128749
self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against    64.51741560391179
the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth    1442.195556980645
Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be    173.37179920960705
the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances,    455.218779689437
contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958,    168.67608815390074
the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by    508.59824032957783
God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations    847.7907592357753
preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out    531.1385484708571
of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified    71.45749042631672
artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity",    71.75968935181993
the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the    221.96900424697563
size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control    355.48613179798065
of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement    285.060776989354
also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression    1656.0614709238023
of mutual affection <without> relation to procreation is right".   509.9158684954642
Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate    620.9156821911114
pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared    305.0067946692476
it at times to be a <religious duty>. What determines the morality,    1005.5343075622662
they state, is not the <means> used, but the <motive>. In    233.56654572414243
general, the means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective are    2031.3245602513173
considered the most ethical.   This development is reflected in    135.67047408432475
the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the    157.44852162617988
National    1.0
Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the    86.4265526537495
~US. The board approved and commended the use of birth-control    1597.5203766347822
devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning. It    372.6438704730702
called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting    2374.8252442720127
the information or availability of contraceptives.   The general    355.3103351418351
board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception    364.7013405415503
and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are    695.7908903032346
right **h. The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather    707.9272164961862
than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are    820.0347262427932
limited to the prevention of conception".   An action once universally    880.2204172069017
condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil    365.1284409302982
law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant    143.70979138867585
denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive    304.8366393343186
<religious duty>. This viewpoint has now been translated into    294.63998839561856
action by the majority of people in this country. Repeated polls have    114.31513211873443
disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the    861.2195223633189
practice of birth control.   For all concerned with social-welfare    706.9515503614318
legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary    149.97163846891746
change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American    78.01534590367632
people is clear, profound and far-reaching. To try to oppose the general    213.49298336451022
religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative    276.23016237969944
fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was    89.63696783733639
occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.   This brings    1126.8007960497132
us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in    108.20562320939212
the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion:    342.370809768191
They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.    1317.2779821956233
Conscience and religion are concerned with private <sin:> The civil    500.15582812569284
law is concerned with public <crimes>. Only confusion, failure    814.5736747164739
and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority    532.394841406739
the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the    572.9072935748522
possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived    381.871859471683
imposition would be religion itself.    68.9204896477256
##   1.0
On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, <Discovery>,    1545.593627662648
weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool, London, and    478.6183859217578
floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain,    1455.5865613182714
a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration    1195.6285200104899
of the Arctic waters of North America.   Seventeen months later,    789.6746604447488
on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the <Discovery>    1442.8360018145902
limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port,    2610.987697546602
she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The    549.3874387221108
captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded    482.1101149574559
her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.   What disaster    968.8325850949483
struck the <Discovery> during those seventeen months? What happened    1241.819276443347
to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained    1187.774348136692
one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the    82.03475299880652
evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal,    474.31245015304506
(2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note    530.5870281597507
found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand    1489.6664705614721
reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture.   But    313.05284245310185
since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal    744.861645834122
files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not    150.2841868018404
enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate    184.02129104984277
picture of the events of the voyage.   Historians have had    136.2903894437945
two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First,    321.58800483176526
they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed    919.4837109225673
it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose    125.26356249710145
name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties,    1001.5692825809236
on a great American river, and on half a million square miles    389.93075027895526
of Arctic seas.   The name: <Henry Hudson>.   This    1004.6451726154315
is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or    579.8272986801719
ever, probably, will be able- to determine:   The sailing in    55.155615521381115
the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time    329.17851451217183
his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western    338.7922717806857
Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy    144.87164038485238
Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole    892.1858865947875
or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy    251.93728478989223
Company indicated it would not back him again.   In 1609, the    80.640231790857
Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers,    3055.8170161143094
fitted him out with a ship called the <Half Moon>, and supplied    253.11885351308078
him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the    600.2560227936028
middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important-    1075.2644949132114
the Great North (later, the Hudson) River- but it produced    231.61228896062113
no northwest passage. ##   15.388416354120638
When the <Half Moon> put in at    308.18621236501
Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings    112.55409639268892
leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government    146.71458425946122
forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went    1054.7460439408958
to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime,    1747.361806208154
he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage    286.85150945177156
of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran    784.0426620655827
ship called the <Discovery> and had recruited a crew of twenty-one,    352.81576751867874
the largest he had ever commanded.   The purpose of this    225.40452410193333
fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that    651.045002468126
a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe    539.0678069679833
and    1.0
the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a    359.8132565827003
passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's    1569.5018267271812
sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.   606.8369328160281
But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to    1672.137073141865
the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had    2099.2519584264455
noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the    651.8948887851394
water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He    748.2609498238417
named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious    3148.1639370516846
Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)   203.31350237589197
In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little <Discovery> that    222.96359998259425
Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his    815.0674478627385
frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all    2871.6288967638807
the    1.0
way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.   1759.831682889905
Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he    775.4528479099093
was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous,    2142.9566457587334
ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely    303.91290191810737
such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.    560.4502990447189
On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of    418.5396496203415
Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that    715.6673986730832
he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case. On    451.1754350925674
the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch    1005.6054887166486
and English crew members on the <Half Moon> had almost forced him    334.9813446387388
to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.   Worse,    1529.5832918079498
his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before. Of    691.3912920683581
only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son. The    1972.9576869982502
mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the <half Moon>,    644.1578207750713
was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or    389.79979355331216
desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was    1672.3804010540116
a good worker, but perversely independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael    2610.9884717996893
Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson    1444.2525527855903
in a crisis.   But men willing to sail at all into waters where    2781.4450261755596
wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find. Hudson    1662.2295694635081
knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer. And    264.3349732901685
he refused to be anything else.   It is believed that Hudson    196.9515010974814
was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was    245.3527351991382
trained    1.0
on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with three sons.    843.976667965259
(The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name    526.2475826417408
was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.) In 1610,    824.8677963325227
Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn    915.210442579699
voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.    1199.8154637790283
##   1.0
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a    500.18941477059593
few miles down the Thames. There at the river's edge waited one Henry    2090.683122577752
Greene, whom Hudson listed as a "clerk". Greene was in actuality    516.4729406923675
a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in    1425.4217651686333
order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores.    656.1029334968008
He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board    605.4453036121262
and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the <Discovery> picked    1100.7811363535723
him up.   For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the    89.29169163434729
east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward. On May 11, she    1495.375315550418
reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the    750.1354782286314
crew called "Lousie Bay". The subsequent two-weeks wait made the    1288.633594139248
crew quarrelsome. With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked    1739.4702561966067
a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue was    412.9754284200451
settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined    3407.217514855402
to catch the next fishing boat back to England. With difficulty,    408.7106428374132
Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.    3384.855066472839

Early in June, the <Discovery> passed "Desolation"    1951.2185558607032
(southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall".    1109.6130495216482
Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog hung    676.7996067257426
over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.    1610.4302998129453
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic    356.43361943198715
North Pole.   As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was    1040.504426990473
forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the    921.0868281675666
great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he    972.3720787111328
turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the    455.58675344644416
crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.   The trouble    1017.1522847298968
was at least partly Juet's doing. For weeks he had been saying that    357.97067047929266
Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd. The great,    833.9521622735423
crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice    252.44282117687857
of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would    569.1345675182647
sail no farther.   Instead of quelling the dissension, as many    807.1577036477142
captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's    873.5470749733403
head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable.    498.84056054910906
He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which    550.6595828073127
he set up in view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew    155.6732873140872
about their course and their objectives.   When Hudson had finished,    882.0848652734934
the "town meeting" broke down into a general, wordy    179.96779275323038
argument.    1.0
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety    362.9751634740521
of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who    815.4388513953883
said he wouldn't give <ten> pounds to be home. The statement was    794.1376781056077
effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson was free to sail on. ##    3942.8397471731073
All through July the <Discovery> picked her way along the 450-mile-long    1537.6820430780274
strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands. On August 3, two massive    957.0942559439418
headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before,    374.1889114448078
so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape    1533.3747906559436
a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands    385.85993564024807
of screaming sea birds. To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind    1957.2361422592314
to a precipice of 2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and    2713.2818505839905
Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.   Hudson pointed the <Discovery>    574.0270960317295
down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called    865.2767721256574
Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the    85.22682060466764
Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered    430.3356716384653
an area of shallow marshes and river deltas. The ship halted. The    1205.3395213002552
great "sea to the westwards" was a dead end.   This must have    238.40531952999672
been Hudson's blackest discovery. For he seemed to sense at once    652.385579308755
that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North    319.1285642764184
American continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to    297.5408999853847
know he was destined to failure.   Feverishly, he tried to brush    305.58519413533776
away this intuition. North and south, east and west, back and forth    136.61130178214052
he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land    2038.1283233329114
appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after    222.79524672735857
week. Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England    106.12175765166111
through the "Furious Overfall" was again filling with ice.   1326.9911507356721
The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking.    1448.1867286509357
Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest. Hudson's reply    1087.9297436008294
was to accuse the mate of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove    3188.446469503439
his charges in an open trial.   The trial was held September    152.75452987046822
10. Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony    2257.8427593627366
from crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men    1012.176946418849
stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe    3477.5898628910018
swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords    535.2431398914979
in their cabins. Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted    1844.0675985168546
bloodshed on the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the    375.8797678519989
ship homeward.   Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new    507.2087240357261
mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There were other    675.6932559420771
shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.    557.8875262811031
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis    444.31157004665766
Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.   1204.8406022543445
As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little    603.0369330677859
bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him. Once,    933.2769438408047
after the <Discovery> lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered    1057.0582738642333
the anchor raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being    409.75058913759557
hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and Adame Moore    2348.578054345351
were thrown off the capstan and badly injured. The anchor cable would    2459.0108279847523
have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever    2182.4023429072786
it with his axe.   128.96467808871603
Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian    3999.613771893203
Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands,    121.29515677538733
conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River    170.95594204822243
of the North. Since the land he desired lay within the great northern    691.1815490004907
empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of    1331.5412375822755
the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies. Having    1835.8691520586885
achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the    90.39424827781579
valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched    1004.5197880858661
southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red- was    946.5019794380268
made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots    238.82741090617495
was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus    2483.79200981485
at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify    795.5828401953244
the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle    866.4231480647119
of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the    321.1276069873456
center of the North American continent to the west of the American    90.34592483383501
agricultural frontier.   Seven hundred miles south of York Factory,    208.93576442717585
at "the Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three    828.6908693083628
men located a settlement in August 1812. By October the little    684.4192858957292
colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg) numbered 100. Within    1604.298230652707
a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring    1077.4539927483013
the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called <Meurons>.    1351.3390268155822
The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported    2324.3247499745808
by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the    77.00781182593836
War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of    525.1934877472675
the war in 1815. Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go    648.1802189187468
to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect    164.79977200001707
his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the    409.74275237535556
intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries    1444.9261157059004
were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of    745.9168462062274
the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as    715.0862939210622
1818.   It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages    837.5453935059296
of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement    336.70239897010595
southward. When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was    234.02553822899006
assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and <metis> moved up    1908.5444723677017
the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built huts and    1645.053077547464
a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland.    2548.6893514727612
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer    7868.255874493395
to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for    614.8367845317101
food.   The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move    998.1863408686869
southward by British fur traders. For many years the Northwest Company    603.2774874495583
had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi    206.8297006066642
River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul,    218.69107410763456
Minnesota. When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm    212.35385872631122
out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American    572.1117120598992
citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly-    2679.7209480935308
continued in the fur business. On Big Stone Lake near the    764.5531788511886
headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of    153.6786790689207
the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned    673.2066198520589
in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small    898.6257259119288
artillery pieces. His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks    1044.5915448706282
of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south    436.3467368707809
in carts. These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days    1054.286470144996
of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk    1598.6617906215752
colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new carts" as    740.972595046156
being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as    95.72747496816677
a horse could pack. They were held together by pegs and withes and    987.6246913756396
in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.   It was Dickson    2849.6560363408635
who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast    847.6576518930989
by way of the United States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina)    208.79447952167757
Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux,    648.507372979425
he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the trip Selkirk decided    239.14702796941216
that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern    595.7306508730434
United States was the best route for goods from England to reach    757.5706337345085
Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply    71.21122307585733
for many goods than either Canada or England. Upon arriving at    1023.1902696285715
Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams,    283.58689118671174
Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade    1837.7999038755142
with "Missouri and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he    687.3233693125967
declared prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at first,    206.25204978728195
would increase with the progress of our Settlements **h".    227.70695343620056
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop    643.4487943644427
into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might    622.1686590497079
have expected. In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the    387.31163429111456
Forks" (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort    1356.4961491650413
Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien.    232.72261509468436
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three    315.48231300277723
months of labor on Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice    2177.986799423523
gone from the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river)    596.5619722396021
their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels    3159.4347632227327
of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats    512.0680249169438
and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse,    5970.084688280439
and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820. This    1100.8456855635582
epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk @1,040.    839.8331707959296
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were    894.1390247373589
forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became    4686.816027161201
more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.   141.870444146492
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony    522.7411337058618
on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send    1634.0027717971614
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post    372.8023839240325
300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien, until then the most advanced    53.35790836682518
United States post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry    1239.545569559786
arrived at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of navigation    382.63429592422557
on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St&    335.60893713745133
Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander,    934.992684490444
Colonel Josiah Snelling.   It was from the American outposts    420.7568063929728
that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules    307.3487032504414
L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted    1913.142285158008
to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and    390.14310629049487
Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers. Bailly,    5391.380257223175
after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave    492.1851532582306
some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake    863.0733225040055
Traverse "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the    497.39591643050267
Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the    597.2047747026612
fall. He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families    687.19284192311
of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward    1396.1549095696625
the United States. Observing their distressing condition, Colonel    512.3397111003388
Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military    556.5605657075511
reservation.   As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk    581.0007113845753
settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman    631.1850593172572
of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du Chien was traveling    326.9869414469668
to Red River to open a trade in merchandise. Early in 1822 he was    586.7814998047277
at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.    939.0081796487294
Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird,    447.94647426453616
a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such "sundry    2427.428434738156
articles" to a value of @4,500.   For its part the Hudson's    972.7711129838302
Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement.    224.37472673278083
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier    472.3463307125482
by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the    84.87307180015979
Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer- was on American    455.47174350144365
territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move    610.5478326353021
north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating    2119.381694356618
the timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything",    432.2260791879424
he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment    115.73608294270196
**h". Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut    461.75703176574973
off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350    1700.576590466886
persons stayed in the village. They would attempt to bring supplies    135.66025108803197
from St& Louis or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well    262.3797886650497
as danger".   At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided    616.6788414384293
to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families    195.55303621945896
paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling. The disasters of 1825-1826    756.685003885601
caused more to leave. After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice,    3366.339822261904
snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through    343.5690834395045
a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick. In April    2248.1218539975107
came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until    2770.9677440815053
mid-June. On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month    273.2761712959446
trip across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443 survivors    598.1226206612808
of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but    3568.056589214942
most of them were sent on to Galena and St& Louis, with a few going    571.4483025910728
as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United    381.8475447181246
States. In 1837, 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were    331.32829652769817
living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.   Below the fort,    446.6945917824237
high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi    674.9799905013747
River. At the point where they ended, another settlement grew    449.73439768307696
up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier    1850.1644847809748
in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American    888.193021112001
Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were    1820.4353386880064
joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major    1395.6418647323178
Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840.    390.41539268938885
The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father    949.1253178242473
Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become an important center    473.01891749105573
of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers    486.6670698182019
who remained at Red River.   While population at Fort    713.7698875701701
Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic    533.9796273556492
opportunities did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though    354.03505741771653
the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter    758.3559009801905
which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the    1630.6354586124717
Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade. The Company    628.2422516595526
maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased    510.22117197077847
and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they    337.65452912359336
refrain from trading in furs. Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some    1951.6368343539727
of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs.    5533.321558955226
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed    768.9594721915348
a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed    3386.9642309520887
as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power".    143.51054316163024
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's    316.2067692282777
local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding    1578.9751931744136
any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source    516.0408288339519
of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men    1225.5107329684229
to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried    750.1390039569246
pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St&    1131.6102739201585
Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells,    341.91374745387355
transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This    1174.8820760313288
trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835,    646.7319354266432
but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty    839.041456321567
was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.   203.40454547230948
The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow    703.0051455357774
in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel.    238.24813186804028
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer    1286.5053461437928
humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in    67.23294843300728
the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some    326.8102134849912
of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate    1996.5767612030327
observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen    1472.0090628790945
and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were    1558.6002954839003
"in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house".    1449.0428709635532
A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".   1684.893037695717
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One    548.8186322059398
wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse +    1456.0648620874927
snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses    405.5691835683716
in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times".    264.0115854141237
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved    1422.5066256620926
about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches    7248.104415227721
on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity    666.1063474870596
of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and    2299.6728005206883
sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following    857.570406985825
description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse    811.5772254006724
girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h    848.8632157642257
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from    2808.7084821301
the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression.    2166.4378421115066
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become    375.2562853530023
of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my    470.4135994361434
love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell,    5254.179298799219
an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved    2637.299217701607
in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked    1594.4981062580464
to    1.0
tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about    132.16858812359473
a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive    436.13880660367045
letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married    143.3610172952353
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar    990.8963895581018
as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as    1223.2387021291843
I am    2.6190426275630516
so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote:    739.2092076661861
"I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another    1028.9384714220519
Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down    2605.7675296352963
to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite    2387.452739384645
before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"".    1739.6969183613842
Charles    1.0
Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his    605.3286240387698
comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation,    157.7653666330711
well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like    109.7306393915548
his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his    353.2328386965597
service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups,    374.5638753658635
name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and    274.2630741205505
then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and    410.78941224589084
'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file    239.7526572802218
of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and    565.7171065340543
wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most    124.22565349223967
common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities    2665.3831853783176
referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but    427.56905248498003
a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier    846.7148507331395
stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough    186.24428488340936
as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs    886.9269464308031
from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer    2386.313905300631
to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering    2769.808072252325
from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier    1692.5523530598941
gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence    117.16582468393494
of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three    693.0610627929947
days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack    1079.2688049334542
and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother:    1978.9206341852348
"I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear    980.0357899348274
and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters    1094.584072600014
which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances.    2102.476230789647
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers    2345.361664100586
rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of    401.79687121760486
the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of    549.2906307488378
bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of    160.1923746145091
the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many    2786.2576014082892
Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing    888.5401931834798
from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the    167.43920233551518
sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously    1208.81536061642
written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing    4952.825906237807
about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863,    794.8642715074333
stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced    1686.4162560139137
writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we    366.09281967713514
take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed    2241.449773679785
his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often    516.0336542453919
**h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just    311.8015978153978
count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every    2024.8961057852018
time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta    1529.8331343455445
reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they    495.5684553446152
will knock over my ink, so I will close". #/3,#   246.8555194469898
The most    2.225222709362395
common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But    625.7650511713405
fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and    368.95189237073225
these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing    809.2563533785965
of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include    2010.1277308060603
in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro    570.8521590827135
community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the    152.37373019619653
war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro    2101.295323604064
"body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging,    1666.9747208484232
cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.    1576.349162880241
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters    1625.86299298586
of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members    479.5975306210646
of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on    593.6709601625995
correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages    1916.1097205324809
characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were    1747.9773302755273
stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally    592.9609562556215
gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about    3477.902763713706
their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or    1097.885702729368
Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier    759.7656252840354
whose    1.0
feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully    1460.9147231620414
of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout    2017.433873418323
I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it    1162.7291835742749
all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five    105.70790732848602
of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I    2273.4570837745664
recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they    163.43566843485752
would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk".    605.745456792403
Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who,    846.7323952248289
from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment    717.3338552083642
on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself    656.7621860845541
thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was    885.0590676237814
a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having    632.2859271051154

helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as    1322.0915393085202
i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from    2372.666212153309
soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions.    455.9158358073918
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his    177.65396355669583
first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting    2215.3201185947705
yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they    363.6729914278564

and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit    1388.3998794522743
Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers    287.30183044652915
in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi    1687.5194944318632
soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain,    1213.782428440143
stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry    1194.8805915327016
is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation    936.9867124572758
of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to    559.1842929196666
tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H&    594.3082388440395
Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees    2593.1058829179033
from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a    185.96406528685318
private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton    1229.121670616926
and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head    375.06976408230423

**h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow    1334.1507063996162
their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point    178.0557663028238
graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments    312.3631984488192
about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.    48.88440598095802
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War    86.68876127647471
version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves    394.40242093702625
as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks    149.9086387521606
**h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten    377.1849311951447
cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George    578.8195162248843
Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My    384.26777584615695
own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended    431.1038666734908
long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I    2377.931858061332
wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging    1847.3902588445915
them against [the other half]".   No group of officers    76.36749329825408
came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal    1136.6977054207064
soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde    2265.494473857454
with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after    550.5143597763807
the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank    2018.95882373181
wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital    313.86945848065386
for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed-    642.7875439898587
thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union    1036.3385086177313
quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward    1416.8631311598567
each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut    625.9300550799741
of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to    1461.0726849668954
a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey    491.555249691311
+ gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier    394.5301929301472
wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw    695.6065526342346
they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h".    138.70220406369162
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote    1303.36808993802
in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right    628.7954250533152
**h found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe    312.9797833944238

with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would    6194.587094990221
be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing    1731.3048081946272
from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama    717.0633089353574
Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that    44.3836868494565

THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION    1124.1938553417392
to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism    426.6735099631994
in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence    74.3001460955641
across the world. Thus, if we are to observe American folklore    411.3063937528804
in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships    140.03386167583733
between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.   236.70142181994703
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism    779.9510470680513
and international influence. 1) Every age rewrites the events    612.5361883828477
of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends    234.80325224399857
about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary    564.2688144683409
actions. What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important    173.22447321060173
as what a given generation feels must have occurred. 2) As a country    299.3447675293557
superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches    1728.721983645099
its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness. Its folklore    3366.369793867747
and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account    889.1770502221002
for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to    261.7230456963764
become a cohesive force for national identification.   One can apply    677.2952100460082
these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries    581.9730907321652
as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be    1789.5753876928516
applied again to the United States in more recent years. The popularity    41.663326531322184
of local color literature before the Spanish-American War, the    482.2270674855662
steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the    302.30921302376197
frontier west in our mass media are cases in point. Nor is it an accident    454.46940968842557
that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years,    131.69949649781802
has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such    313.74115093228613
as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical    209.1253973962421
Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature,    384.8480234833775
American civilization, American anything have swept our school    1559.5617422963292
and college curricula.   Of course, nationalism has really    361.5176178794511
outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its    428.017712002719
continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the    276.76032517429434
twentieth-century    1.0
United States. Yet nationalism has lost few of its    238.08778718602443
charms for the historian, writer or man in the street. It is an understandable    443.12968004215764
paradox that most American history and most American literature    88.88922439641037
is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic    1146.4037538042473
point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion    326.8834978695975
over palm and pine. After all, the average American as he lies and    725.2046332201184
waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain    3104.236308019873
hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or    325.29538478705
her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental    111.7647581279464
actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.    338.0014992637532
Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether    89.0722644170818
warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense    1507.7652028870941
emotional involvement. Such identification comes for each group in each    456.0092281351693
crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate    1977.1731457883513
national heroes.   In America, such self-deception has served    200.98657976389464
a particularly useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed it    701.6747793800447
to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and    224.75141782784416
ever-changing    1.0
land. But we must never forget, most of the appropriate    108.24415365147246
heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs,    1572.7969462712601
almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson Weems's George    3207.664468053842
Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of    111.28453278494756
the uniting States. Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of    792.1689154769358
the national Constitution. Robert E& Lee represented the dignity    520.9089850052189
needed by a rebelling confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by    298.63064160715385
those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett,    2991.088220776624
Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.   Therefore, the    170.70343589881531
scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years,    73.26218364238824
will be mindful of two facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created    315.2477467799814
to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are    2955.5052406812797
not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that an "American national    221.153351089949
folklore" exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.   913.8308846373375
Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group    666.3880819848005
of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission. It    3451.063139072998
has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions,    3009.3798315245062
rhymes and such literary forms of expression. Related to    360.9904918256299
written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written    822.9627588144614
form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral    2196.4228778938086
existence. Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies,    561.7466960039802
it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.   451.30501334319683
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our    1760.664441517392
folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as    305.3321426723196
this. Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus    3392.9793662466236
materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor    2208.933043090989
union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition. Nor    1406.7264310166845
have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of    163.05656466205477
isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did    1124.170821123582
not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education    625.8050268277291
and industrialization    1.1892015568822696
had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as    261.3714439220352
a means of carrying culturally significant material.   Naturally,    388.73396020705377
such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make    162.21434479426446
money or fan patriotism by means of folklore. That much of what he    433.2950996519739
calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people    298.19780287699183
with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction    817.7087615304131
to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant. As long    1458.401314077467
as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses    562.4391952424194
and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains satisfied.   691.8472846592696
From all this we can now see that two streams of development    128.6054800661539
run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore. On    268.53502023173
the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained    502.8559578599925
in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected    216.84114774765908
and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic,    687.9725446383176
regional and occupational groups that make up this nation. On the other    325.2237941849966
we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been    221.23488749550836
willing to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial material    1217.4653731906185
willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists (writers, movie    198.0636392151375
producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore    819.9255376793263
since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams    238.4700968007722
even in the most general of ways. After all, the field is large, difficult    341.2053899192979
to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates.    1587.0538836468365
In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many    153.7786150551209
heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of    265.8062102753661
print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society.    1499.4188289501567
The problems confuse even the experts.   For that matter,    282.28233934673824
the experts themselves are a mixed breed. Anthropologists, housewives,    1421.8389532939639
historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline    2023.8919399974347
as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination    1136.6010989620308
of the four. They have widely varying backgrounds and aims.    2575.1748737005623
They have little "esprit de corps".   The outlook for the    79.17197561166421
amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local    110.69507360085886
history or for the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism    476.27304789979866
in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.    828.2140960450541
Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain    1432.6337120461646
as such. The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is    844.0886789617181
actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field. The collector    73.30715935153827
enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the    519.168642727917
very "field and stream" reasons that many persons hunt game; and    804.1241112708046
only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has    133.95217079248434
located. Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector,    888.9269321956356
are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between    428.0234458107976
real folklore and bogus material.   But there are also the commercial    108.80010781804333
propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other    256.87576524203837
by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are primarily concerned    367.21678616286533
with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector    329.8280622587395
has found. Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond    512.4035236523415
the sewage system and the electric light lines. The commercial propagandist,    972.2811293092064
who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the    176.7943131988276
amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's    423.0981084527781
toes by refusing to keep his material genuine. His standards are,    803.8770868208351
