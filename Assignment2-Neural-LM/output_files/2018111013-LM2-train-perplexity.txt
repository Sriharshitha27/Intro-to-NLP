The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation    1.5122976371301822
of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence" that    1.36181463885833
any irregularities took place.   The jury further said in term-end    1.457637751470158
presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all    1.5994175973352829
charge of the election, "deserves the praise and thanks of the    1.7081353763580862
City of Atlanta" for the manner in which the election was conducted.   2.0834720844500123
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton    1.2524725224515154
Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible    1.350110288980194
"irregularities" in the hard-fought primary which was won by    1.422842052007257
Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr&.   "Only a relative handful    1.3633670553918078
of such reports was received", the jury said, "considering the    1.8123722738003374
widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size    2.1855165402893437
of this city".   The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's    2.449270477447775
registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate    1.2341174716710612
and often ambiguous".   It recommended that Fulton legislators    1.3955220305326097
act "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing    1.7921071974460447
and improving them".   The grand jury commented on a number    1.6404045913021714
of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing    1.6456008268007885
departments which it said "are well operated and follow generally    1.402693932076836
accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments".    1.4896457008909052
#MERGER PROPOSED#   1.9679283553443014
However, the jury said it believes "these    1.9165800428275872
two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce    1.3688007071915547
the cost of administration".   The City Purchasing Department,    1.772938002666958
the jury said, "is lacking in experienced clerical personnel    1.7180553981765578
as a result of city personnel policies". It urged that the city "take    2.2183512402180634
steps to remedy" this problem.   Implementation of Georgia's    1.2874880641649848
automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.   1.400013549547396
It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling funds    1.6069059626719586
and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of    1.3514523459586112
the law may be effected".   The grand jury took a swipe at the    1.5942602437637055
State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for    1.3452132309972284
child welfare services in foster homes.   "This is one of the    1.5630326859380679
major items in the Fulton County general assistance program", the    1.5930606222160135
jury said, but the State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute    1.5263287783459587
these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties    1.7381895255726145
in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives    2.7541680293191937
none of this money.   The jurors said they realize "a proportionate    1.6112046978366654
distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less    1.4802221135851497
populous counties".   Nevertheless, "we feel that in the    1.695693838826095
future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available    1.3224278829494662
funds", the jurors said. "Failure to do this will continue to place    2.041077887667332
a disproportionate burden" on Fulton taxpayers.   The jury    1.2732970692048227
also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under    1.6122814896398232
fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and    1.446968108473371
administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.    1.2666608356694977
#WARDS PROTECTED#    1.800060807169164
The jury said it found the court "has incorporated into    1.8077993007555972
its operating procedures the recommendations" of two previous grand    1.4589145489630055
juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.   1.3819845986876336
"These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms", the jury said.   Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended "that when the new management takes charge Jan& 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences".   2.3412245310580047
The jury did not elaborate, but it added that "there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable".   1.7202869216622318
#ASK JAIL DEPUTIES#   103.74224682331729
On other matters, the jury recommended that: _(1)_ Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and "a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail". _(2)_ Fulton legislators "work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable" pension plan for city employes.   2.591533600496124
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.   1.5760039358183695
Mayor William B& Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife, Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton Superior Court Friday. His petition charged mental cruelty.   The couple was married Aug& 2, 1913. They have a son, William Berry Jr&, and a daughter, Mrs& J& M& Cheshire of Griffin.   Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon.   The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney" and his age as 71. It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika, Ala&.   The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year.   2.683778768749497
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E& Pelham Rd& ~NE.   6.516102049979376
Henry L& Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney.   1.4674812871431724
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception of one brief interlude, since 1937. His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923.   The mayor's present term of office expires Jan& 1. He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr&, who became a candidate in the Sept& 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection.   4.529078289367408
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.   2.594434557458522
Robert Snodgrass, state ~GOP chairman, said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.   State Party Chairman James W& Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept& 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen& John Tower will be the featured speaker.   In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.   Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.   2.0460939106272686
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no- and there were no dissents.   2.0458558338851045
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a    1.7916290107383877
state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative    1.522298744779607
courses must be taken: _1._ Five per cent of the voters    8.154103102397006
in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be    1.44848392096678
allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot,    1.445268608275166
or _2._ The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit    3.5696644045633286
system- a system which the party opposes in its platform.   1.4210505090478542
Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations director,    1.4413243046617876
resigned Tuesday to work for Lt& Gov& Garland Byrd's    1.3650531441023372
campaign.   Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some    1.4037190873617862
time. He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville, who has    1.5677369367248881
been an assistant more than three years. When the gubernatorial campaign    1.6694759862390944
starts, Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for    1.844104935123597
Byrd.   1.0
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday    6.552520466879156
and head for home- where some of the highway bond money it approved    1.9831456538084953
will follow shortly.   Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the    1.323229918137336
Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators    2.377558995297952
allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should    1.4102845800476536
be made.   Gov& Vandiver is expected to make the traditional    2.3501902078438817
visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment. Vandiver likely    1.4269245901434724
will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier    6.8479045496811795
in the session as his first priority item.    2.300492595471188
#CONSTRUCTION BONDS#   2.235958254782947
Meanwhile,    1.0
it was learned the State Highway Department is very near    2.1962840108736517
being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction    5.7072368211407625
bonds.   The bond issue will go to the state courts for a    1.9118441450878725
friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales    1.624974131160469
will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's    1.4654249671643949
most heavily traveled highways.   A Highway Department source    1.324117440014492
said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million    12.416276950380125
worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.    1.5297788290870014
#A REVOLVING FUND#   2.8618653997659984
The department apparently intends to make    1.4330248356660944
the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would    1.43480411544508
be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax    1.8913415494648893
authorities.   Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with    3.9090484956289977
a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth    6.569587197046666
of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov& Marvin    1.4137020817064694
Griffin.   The Highway Department source told The Constitution,    1.4328837846728075
however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans    1.7076945865848498
to issue the new rural roads bonds.   1.5424513065803123
Schley County Rep& B& D& Pelham will offer a resolution    1.2981368815601981
Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in    1.785540393610437
voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.   Pelham    5.869536797219027
said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the    1.516853246709043
"quickie" vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether    1.4900408112880943
notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action    1.853701503765145
would be sought.   While emphasizing that technical details were    1.6622000985184895
not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set    1.4116036147648288
aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31.   2.1405942727879634
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5.    2.3646489474833134
As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered    1.9021290181304373
there to rescind the action.   Pelham pointed out that Georgia    1.4303824505874316
voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators    1.3581478401131266
to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.   1.4174308749013604
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House    1.3426883542849817
Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently    1.3601152072732032
opposed in the past.   Rep& Mac Barber of Commerce is    1.728355223086032
asking the House in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal    1.514523769027613
support for public education, provided that such funds be received    1.4291353204641348
and expended" as state funds.   Barber, who is in his 13th    8.21298385703045
year as a legislator, said there "are some members of our congressional    1.9579511957631608
delegation in Washington who would like to see it (the resolution)    1.7688791121106175
passed". But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically    1.4903881229341789
asked him to offer the resolution.   The resolution, which    1.5690612587981676
Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, will be formally read    1.4055075226214306
Monday. It says that "in    1.3855137630766174
the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds", the    1.504744990993688
State Board of Education should be directed to "give priority"    1.6904555402559043
to teacher pay raises. _COLQUITT_- After a long, hot controversy,    1.4220979191895482
Miller County has a new school superintendent, elected, as a    1.4868908431163819
policeman put it, in the "coolest election I ever saw in this county".   1.659629008666104
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran    1.8490908347831683
agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and    1.2820907220433562
chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.   1.8167645238107164
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush    6.330103142608699
got 402. Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with a pistol, stood by at    1.7908241296821255
the polls to insure order.   "This was the coolest, calmest    1.6129641598086564
election I ever saw", Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said. "Being    1.3017870595175047
at the polls was just like being at church. I didn't smell    1.929762406003454
a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble".   The    1.78003043607632
campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however. It was    1.7791175082185284
marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats    1.2723807866002146
of violence.   The former county school superintendent, George    1.4595080838878998
P& Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he    5.606135822010087
resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.   During    1.4450937862677926
the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly    1.2806508905606888
received anonymous telephone calls. Ordinary Williams said he,    1.3296139005640617
too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.   1.3599835280705217
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities    1.5350216004955368
at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun    1.808176164648863
and promised an orderly election.   Sheriff Felix Tabb said the    1.2747777154902091
ordinary apparently made good his promise.   "Everything went    1.2483543146798823
real smooth", the sheriff said. "There wasn't a bit of trouble".    1.5230702232241005
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Committee approval of Gov& Price Daniel's    1.4675554930431136
"abandoned property" act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant    1.2744399684600978
protests of Texas bankers.   Daniel personally led the fight    1.3490538722502778
for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its    2.168442840526193
rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before    1.5279757054292635
the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.   Under committee    1.5313133585193481
rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week. But    1.361382839443678
questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses    1.2862834896390531
left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.   1.5488563049539132
Daniel termed "extremely conservative" his estimate that it would    1.4748368802413865
produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of    1.90614957766059
63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug&    2.5300864387192146
31.   He told the committee the measure would merely provide means    1.8250674374907412
of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books "since    1.7604814655287073
Texas was a republic". It permits the state to take over bank accounts,    1.4643515331566035
stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven    1.3553155261461705
years or more.   The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally,    1.6268079335392909
would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other    1.4193598893260109
corporations to report such property to the state treasurer. The escheat    1.6333042172296417
law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate    1.7782145585716482
such property, Daniel declared.   Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler    1.2407103885099313
lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition    1.351272735707043
keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual    1.743255845366474
obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank    1.2801464608955202
customers.   "If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something    1.3622990528026682
to the economy", he said. "You take out of circulation many    2.208858013684855
millions of dollars".   Rep& Charles E& Hughes of Sherman,    1.5718226936920665
sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount "to    1.5738599138734835
making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance    1.9143295399113311
and pipeline companies".   His contention was denied by several    1.280117353392531
bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B& Jones    1.2472330506538392
of Houston, J& B& Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.   1.3078967881127141
Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"    1.6531090184172619
since, he said, it would impair contracts.   He also complained    1.6464022316062097
that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was    1.5877845477336334
introduced only last Monday.    1.2314581204686228
_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill    1.5218386870087508
of Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment    1.311733699098011
of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.   1.7527607715578923
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more    1.7613722188214715
deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.   1.5673592616369045
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the    2.029228659277013
House.   It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish    1.3551645689105025
county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or    5.683274196033139
more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age    10.930282925983803
to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential    1.8675451333660054
Texas School for the Deaf here.   Operating budget for the    1.5760785702452362
day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant    1.635774000017432
and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460    10.51629031376005
yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed,    8.989898101717285

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- State representatives decided Thursday against    1.4580394376914376

An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee    15.56528480006946
a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when    4.610788777486182
Texas votes on a U&S& senator.   Rep& Wesley Roberts    1.2512701011469052
of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the    1.4169940990849197

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas'    1.6236504108760499
big cities Thursday.   Rep& James Cotten of Weatherford    1.2202858102944465
insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House    1.5161793386605615
of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort    1.5247623320200867
Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet    1.2774962144649356
of 250 people.   When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114    3.5052395310271507
to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored    2.1203996462795205
by Sen& George Parkhouse of Dallas.   Most of the fire    2.0764919536940685
was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen& Parkhouse. The    1.4198776705171838
bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan    10.738436186021335
the state could make to a local water project.   Cotten construed    1.6918390096916336
this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large    1.4112096525966793
cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing    1.283840237213433
water for rural Texas.   Statements by other legislators that    1.2886331042364343
Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less    1.532569756229322
populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway    1.3615456108776798
Cotten's attack.   The bill's defenders were mostly small-town    1.288365212108608
legislators like J& W& Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio (Kika)    1.190818103315745
de la Garza of Mission, Sam F& Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman    1.2752453127784509
of Sulphur Springs.   "This is a poor boy's bill",    1.9259637947132726
said Chapman. "Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds. This would    1.3693471120914922

methods".   Rep& Henry C& Grover, who teaches    1.197458157118939

hours the so-called "teaching methods" courses required to    1.316772142910256
obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate. A normal    1.3546538282101785
year's work in college is 30 semester hours.   Grover also would    4.702076523922881

credit in the subject they are teaching. The remainder of the 4-year    2.5164337470952716

The report, culminating a year long study of the ~ADC program in    1.6699059044344073
Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10    2.8584996120407027
long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ~ADC    1.38884461813416
case load. The report called racial discrimination in employment "one    1.4136379250443263
of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and ~ADC    2.2475758340823404
dependency". #"MUST SOLVE PROBLEM"#   35.03461003548351
The monthly cost    1.2746853741947115
of ~ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million    15.767579596740859

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made    1.2471940512772657
statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge    1.6805025372464126
James B& Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.    1.3437844277518145
The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled    1.2361019423075938

attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.   1.3486079073149528
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant    1.4577746845953625
his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial. Bellows made the request    7.52443608022582

"The statements may be highly prejudicial to my    1.4129517219002086
client", Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly    2.0409553784809877
indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property. It is impossible    1.3756063501844102
to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements    2.2093484054982433
involving themselves and others".   Judge Parsons leaned over    1.3167780010550676
the bench and inquired, "You mean some of the defendants made statements    1.7317984764280687
admitting this"?   "Yes, your honor", replied    1.1884780657748815
Bellows. "What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all    1.9010485088250688
fight in this case. There is a conflict among the defendants".    2.299749295422847

The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov& 8 election    21.754882497045955
were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M& Karns, who    1.3221719987426879
charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally    1.3771829953487251
illegal means".   Karns said that the cases involved a    1.7130520217895444
matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"    1.5005506771192476
of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in violation of    4.080543575340002
the legal rights of citizens".   Karns' ruling pertained to    1.3040965226364427
eight of the 10 cases. In the two other cases he ruled that the state    4.285578752459726
had been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings originally    2.141809591764402
had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J&    20.105614685632045

#ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS#   2.5116204031939042
Wexler    1.0
admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas    1.3118827527372896
to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned    7.901547039035313
the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them    1.5073855256254836
before the grand jury.   Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election    1.6107251004819734
judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure    50.121253654197155
constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion    1.1845528998375447
was used in questioning.   Karns said it was a "wrongful act"    1.8863046115844375
for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand    1.5172435581099484
jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious misuse"    1.4586607021152036
of the Criminal court processes.   "Actually, the abuse of the    2.3140646166485896
process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook    1.425063239080623
county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the    1.6460013936150182
function of this court", said Karns, who is a City judge in East    1.6985224497820322
St& Louis sitting in Cook County court.    1.4607558989255847
#FACED SEVEN CASES#    2.5791006851189504
Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35    1.9882160351252551
persons. Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with    1.3965820668324567

in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken    33.30836901562504
under advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under advisement.    1.4238243231483558
#CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING#   20.174959059825802
After reading his statement discharging    1.1818297831661135
the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases    4.547387568908505
scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he    1.5976387794015636

_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth    8.605850473979231
new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million    5.069082445324112
American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other    1.76786383552598
medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by    32.7743058437149
social security or railroad retirement programs.   The President,    1.414188647495437
in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan    1.9969901069228813
requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships,    1.5555117061680384
build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child    8.175854987442854
health care and general medical research.   The aged care plan,    1.3875427250340682
similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a    1.6818050121603174
fight on Capitol hill. It was defeated in Congress last year.    1.4475585106516784
#COST    1.0
UP TO $37 A YEAR#   7.101523122065865
It would be financed by boosting the social security    2.224120917075916
payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now    3.7915613642109713
paying such taxes.   The social security payroll tax is now 6    1.9525314967683827
per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4,800    3.6446677222387502
of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to    1.4168025967477589
$5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each.    11.903050688964491
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad    1.3655353724091046
retirement system.   The payroll tax would actually rise    1.3861514419830372
to 7.5 per cent starting Jan& 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because    8.562992459622814
the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date    4.730346876135853
to pay for other social security costs.    1.7388703449108063
#OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE#    7.2471042706065125
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would    1.4210938073707486
amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would    5.347534630232167
run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. Both figures would go    6.153209205993755
higher in later years.   Other parts of the Kennedy health plan    1.6069368582029593
would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over    21.12481991805028
the next 10 years. These would be paid for out of general, not payroll,    3.6216894341101926
taxes.    1.0
#NURSING HOME CARE#   7.834256937599623
The aged care plan carries these    1.3740082017492408
benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad    6.4172049611636846
retirement systems: _1._ Full payment of hospital bills for    7.384528377977369
stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would    5.6889300527362785
pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days. _2._ Full payment    13.204387056285897
of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from    5.482824496330201
a hospital. A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing    5.6242012099821155
home care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care for those    1.4209252095906237
who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit. _3._ Hospital    5.833659020918836
outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess    1.3362285564742222
of $20 a patient. _4._ Community visiting nurse services at home    14.02644338014628
for up to 240 days an illness.   The President noted that Congress    5.880192602889454
last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical    1.8396843697283631
bills of the needy aged.    1.258135960020103
#CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST#   20.92388947470418
He said his    2.0978150980536263
plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish    1.9068728750496327
to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless    1.418236826708106
staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-    1.4629242011063277
caused by an extended hospital stay".   "This is a very    1.843607449617393
modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said,    1.376086138345018
"and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any    1.5543875893849406
malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.   "This    1.2452679013482737
is not a program of socialized medicine. It is a program of prepayment    3.2909664113590966
of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed. Every    1.4747774410681824
person will choose his own doctor and hospital".    1.3436859336270561
#WOULDN'T    1.0
PAY DOCTORS#   18.450755131998513
The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still    1.5824229432835908
be paid by the patient.   Apart from the aged care plan the President's    2.042246802962299
most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships,    1.282244739599989
and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.   1.4334550806183146
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools    8.099097744156767
cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need    1.6105440808724882
for health care. Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are    1.3853461951130823
not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the    1.3833785407460737
schooling costs.    1.0700024460115365
#CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOOLS#   11.81267469958067
The scholarship plan    1.1517624648184777
would    1.0
provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal    1.469321168740587
to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students. The    4.265951937250653
schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need,    9.970915638182053
of up to $2,000 a year per student.   In addition, the government    4.333655344486468
would pay a $1,000 "cost of education" grant to the schools for    4.574636899538566
each $1,500 in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined    3.4740823826350185
programs would cost    1.1835744064941072
5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21    3.2275580044672125
millions by 1966.   The President recommended federal "matching    5.433719574992792
grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing    31.408177878093046
new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing    1.5705102399492818
ones.    1.0
#MORE FOR NURSING HOMES#   12.496968837830364
In the area of "community health    3.313438550785377
services", the President called for doubling the present 10 million    5.482320454776096
dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction. He asked    1.4649270770177396
for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation for "stimulatory    7.146674735008011
grants" to states to improve nursing homes.   He further    1.459842927936622
proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.   1.3224617787188873
In the child health field, the President said he will recommend    2.712535506188674
later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.    1.5472460792446896
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national    1.852175438162567
child health institute.    1.1516431508886977
#ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS#   18.092791029369213
The President said    2.14085944483151
he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.    1.6647619528096582
He did not say by how much.   For medical research    1.808308732870406
he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions,    24.767498327882404
in matching grants for building research facilities. The President    1.3155136810500467
said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540    2.3426023195228174
million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research    5.134830325811506
in medicine.   The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable    1.5980017800362596
elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge,    1.52806541345307
services, facilities, and the means to pay for them".    1.8716187009745069
#REACTION    1.0
AS EXPECTED#   2.0123506339165558
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected    1.4053696103412192
lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under    1.2470239831401408
the social security system criticized the President's plan. Those    1.6235020007942982
who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.   Senate    1.4106202289248762
Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill&] and House Republican Leader    1.2539604702654448
Charles Halleck [Ind&] said the message did not persuade them    1.399538477079499
to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance. Halleck    1.3821391015674511
said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair    1.800578068563554
trial first.   House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D&, Tex&]    1.33272123336784
called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction    1.5414598738154064
on its fate in the House.    1.9889717537151037
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- Acting hastily under White House pressure,    6.973759311026834
the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C& Weaver as the nation's    1.4408234679308611
federal housing chief.   Only 11 senators were on the floor    7.271652727229112
and there was no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and    2.2868098762428217
"noes" was heard.   Customary Senate rules were ignored in    1.2416660128448715
order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing    1.8988057766113744
and home finance agency.   In the last eight years, all    1.733564098338393
Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been    1.3140284629261958
denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least    1.5821692867589139
a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.    2.3632359420940716
#ENFORCE BY DEMAND#    9.201875622117182
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen& Wayne Morse [D&,    1.359555840275395
Ore&] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet    1.446136256107584
selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.    19.906765985661703
_OSLO_ The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting    1.3252034401622137
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been    1.422232413797256
the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual    1.2460339340005606
understanding than in past meetings.   This has been a working    1.8705390781881697
session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed    1.5349680589202066
along its route step by step and without dramatic changes. In Oslo,    1.32102921719184
the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine    1.685568204754991
attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.   1.6538036144760744
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable    1.3278556385833054
where relations are concerned between the "colonialist" powers    1.2646890189719708
and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.    2.481683872930281
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated    1.3866593878370097
by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other    1.8977114507843074
allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances    1.2358059006881215
that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by    1.3929897702668173
its absence.    1.060142511402936
#EXPLOSION AVOIDED#   18.08521260652296
In the case of Portugal, which    3.1074691691885006
a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the ~NATO Council    2.2810766305886294
should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been    1.4365546309099424
a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general, remarkably courteous,    1.3576807427905193
explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been    1.4686636771723824
no explosion in the council. There should even be no more bitter surprises    1.6870403869537691
in the ~UN General Assembly as to ~NATO members' votes,    2.3827705649287036
since a new ad hoc ~NATO committee has been set up so that    1.560225861027091
in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.   2.4057959288544075
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt    1.3588430368791276
to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the ~NATO    1.8167113625546727
locomotive. Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against    1.2055481395012637
atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance,    1.89107029504296
is today closer to the ~NATO line.   On the negative    1.4919742863116654
side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the    1.7427812010793486
United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.    1.9667703494684796
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's    1.6138853428033244
speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened to add that,    1.3040985258765014
if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr& Rusk's    1.3732955493551051
analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the    1.594939104060536
West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly    1.5691998357743182
fixed its policy.    1.1136779472057847
#EXPLORATORY MOOD#   1.8987801135386704
A certain vagueness may also    1.5271927907364475
be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council    1.8990618908805779
meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents    1.4073236252844539
accredited.   The impression has nevertheless been    1.243896568639678
given during these three days, despite Mr& Rusk's personal popularity,    1.3753153801625322
that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat    2.445076356310435
tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn    1.3961477484792588
than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application    1.4204623262251868
to individual danger spots.   The Secretary of State    1.683765702041322
himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of    1.8876863828450152
events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the    1.8858893011414712
new administration in the past four months.   But where the core    1.8659441138149906
of ~NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only    1.831183125364075
reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance,    1.8831659135086762
"cornerstone" of its foreign policy, but has announced that five    1.564050112956846
nuclear submarines will eventually be at ~NATO's disposal in    1.245996599034239
European waters.   The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated    1.6374992683756286
a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will    2.4601692020048858
not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken    1.3771236725526754
up by the council as a whole.    2.1375339417761903
#CONFLICT SURVEYED#   1.1892015568822696
The secretary's    1.0982000403113716
greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of ~NATO realization    1.3203105112749802
that East-West friction, wherever it take place around the    1.280456872562634
globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different    1.4699283799959268
societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical    1.503863976246743
distance or lack of apparent connection.   The annual spring    1.3656258739276266
meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more, deeper,    1.2894800057442777
and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use    1.5231014033358126
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (when    2.5017561400942148
ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries,    1.4872100631590945
and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the    2.913842833611272
maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.   This increase in the    1.8753435189994954
"threshold", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will    1.3650910641975582
prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months    2.1552649558137364
to come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid    1.9169116110066964
down, but never completely fulfilled.    1.261391666429498
_WASHINGTON_ The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a    1.6938383820249996
Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy    1.4662807524348351
erupts for the first time.   There is little optimism here    2.0482070088802606
that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table    2.222480697485296
than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.   The    1.8709403618212377
United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly    1.7332955518098374
interested in setting up an international inspection system which will    1.6760383961238563
prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring    1.604509790449057
Thailand and South Viet Nam.   They count on the aid    1.5623101605296792
of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve    2.390785451405676
this.   The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet    1.900745610945384
would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent that no acceptable    2.0890755902885254
formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.    1.581405645078305
#POLICIES MODIFIED#   18.08521260652296
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire    1.5054037715626427
in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the    1.6719056496296305
cease-fire by the international control commission before participating    1.3704198182777532
in the Geneva conference.   This is another of the modifications    2.623146280909308
of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled    1.6828380891379784
to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to    1.7992246237599843
basic errors made in the previous administration.   Its spokesmen    1.6464683513992833
insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in    1.7743232926395722
military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.   But    1.3866752892195569
with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the    1.9586259485385928
Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:   1.64839570679666
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy    1.3058594396912115
decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?   Former    1.2814943153088458
Vice-President Richard M& Nixon in Detroit called for a    1.569680071362508
firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union. He was critical    1.6275436524758586
of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.    2.158032290385078
#~GOP RESTRAINED#   1.2574275526860912
It does not take a Gallup poll to    1.9233186102937287
find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the    1.4401819601002508
situation as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves    1.398428915416607
from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been    1.9430718846455424
in power, would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders" in    1.401765238659862
Cuba.   One Republican senator told this correspondent that he    1.2842669362771673
was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration    1.4591991376438016
on this score. His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the    1.9223903858740545
need for unity in the country now. But he further said that it was    2.2446308776873876
better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies    1.4781621366530395
first.   The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through    1.5244473367686044
Senator Thruston B& Morton (~R) of Kentucky, chairman    1.1924008316839187
of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration    2.9559942621581308
would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition    1.9314896063892686
government susceptible of Communist domination.   Kennedy administration    1.2720447953430927
policies also have been assailed now from another direction    1.4230546854852824
by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute    1.7262328870340404

#DETENTE URGED#   20.014577805575286
This group pleads    1.1569406261119661
with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion    2.0197194937700265
of Cuba by exile groups". It recommends that the United States    1.4053269664435524
"seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc    1.5241042737155135
by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations;    1.442836343859336
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other    1.2615314210583775
parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian    1.6365070230167584
nationalism feeds".   Mr& Nixon, for his part, would oppose    1.4401952352222356
intervention in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend    1.3810348195788182
that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries    1.5054275177750218
shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.   1.899563749869442
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories    1.5637863068952114
in Laos,    1.529993826927703
almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended    1.5640968124049028
a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by    1.5084980526661191
Mr& Nixon and the professors.    1.3657980358995319
#AID PLANS REVAMPED#   113.55717466785006
Very early    1.1486124343767454
in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels,    1.7299691291651944
a high official source disclosed, that the new administration    2.044063614600395
would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during    1.5519090678796978
the formative period of the administration.   Strenuous efforts    1.4410019211277691
were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements. Policies    1.3883452590655119
on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But    1.3078869914988402
thus far there has been no response in kind.   Foreign aid programs    1.598082242610325
were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to    1.444874718604616
encourage political reform in recipient nations.   In Laos, the    1.32883756389903
administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show    1.5951625803678406
determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters    1.2471638634866942
as a useless gesture.   Again and again it asked the Communists    1.9985361170786176
to "freeze" the military situation in Laos. But the Communists    1.5981181039949766
aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.   And after several    1.4343931961804712
correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the    1.2589503683767076
huge build-up,    1.041465840183507
administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a    1.2675018066935257
"great service" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty    1.4906405292863374
Organization.   ~SEATO was steamed up and prepared    1.2798646008495236
contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos. But    1.468335868146926
the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for    1.6297012110102793
the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.    1.8442316961882654
(Some ~SEATO nations disagreed, however.)   There    1.2042720206032984
was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded    1.725946108359224
that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined    1.5814735122875527
neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.   The administration    1.420202232888982
declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos. The pro-Western    1.606426825242394
government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against    1.929140803849213
the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did appear    1.2592905139621682
to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.   There    1.3540705287776913
certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United    1.5154524882684037
States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.   1.587772706762718
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an    1.9878052774929922
acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was    1.3802784110864128
too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.   1.2591403433458939
One factor was the statement of Senator J& W& Fulbright (~D)    1.372308261363924
of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.    1.8502571024249341
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a    7.32786081436189
year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal" of Prince Souvanna.    1.791037173264331
_WASHINGTON_ The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check    1.8901360664220745
the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.   1.6935894843208814
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect    1.8400454910531268
upon the "vitality of the nation".   In an important assertion    1.983299879815269
of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive    1.797165328983505
order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency    1.3738287407854362
and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory    1.3624637855370434
Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.   The    1.308518718486023
President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts    1.543692796042065
through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to    1.7453563718680545
states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.    1.280639176475469
#OFFENSES MULTIPLY#   19.122784103350398
The President has also called upon the Attorney    1.8776301482570745
General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and    1.6337072821357188
the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development    2.0624370222792874
of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local    2.384196475742373
communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.   Simultaneously    1.8509396292788702
the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L&    1.8459325180603965
Hackett, a special assistant ot the Attorney General, as executive    1.431192021576955
director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth    2.261672573088019
Crime.   His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the    1.6574911613947299
fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since    1.4216434700664609
1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.   Among arrests    1.984648558226359
reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about    4.637123217339851
half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.   5.17317505219705
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin    1.3741414271245256
by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H& Hawksley, the    1.3603644031319813
present city ~CD head, believes.   Mr& Hawksley said yesterday    1.4485185981453164
he would be willing to go before the city council "or anyone    2.080480091826867
else locally" to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.   1.4205899272987565
East Providence now has no civil defense program. Mr& Hawksley,    1.4671918756645386
the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time ~CD    1.6749824106751907
director in the city for the last nine years. He is not interested in    2.210576053827893
being named a full-time director.   Noting that President Kennedy    1.5572804810625884
has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for    1.5116324635513143
the nation's civil defense program, Mr& Hawksley said the federal    1.720573204577352
government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.   1.6900124682171593
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a ~CD director    1.3812836881097448
for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount    3.5188267693280024
on    1.0
a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.   Mr& Hawksley    1.3254058328682596
said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents    2.2005229632722427
who would be willing to take the full-time ~CD job. One of these    2.305970621330779
men is former Fire Chief John A& Laughlin, he said.   Along    1.346317736547004
with a director, the city should provide a ~CD headquarters so    1.797695959954743
that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.    1.5030363895302457
Mr& Hawksley said.   One advantage that would come to    1.5666151522357654
the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence    2.244727514491101
would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial    1.6144468593442358
aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense    1.5602167639690767
program.   Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of    1.4877409440779787
such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.   Mr&    1.2958258056370264
Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue    1.4659390846504503
trucks, similar to the ~CD vehicle obtained several years ago and    1.5710473046974487
now detailed to the Central Fire Station.   He would assign    1.3694582612539499
one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the    2.744617364949798
other to the Rumford area.   Speaking of the present status of    1.7570474094270099
civil defense in the city, Mr& Hawksley said he would be willing    2.4991932407756807
to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to    1.8357474065392994
do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.   The Narragansett    1.662285440198551
Race Track grounds is one assembly point, he said, and a drive-in    1.6196674311230668
theater in Seekonk would be another. Riverside residents would    1.3300378346967365
go to the Seekonk assembly point.   Mr& Hawksley said he was    1.9588581693452916
not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to    1.5142872804528376
assemble in case of an air attack.   Such vital information, he    1.5193756928291107
said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular    2.4735243130337765
intervals for residents to know.   If the city council fails to    1.693536612356775
consider appointment of a full-time ~CD director, Mr& Hawksley    1.4746937443444217
said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a    1.660374398172804
civil defense organization will be developed locally.   One of    1.4940173979502358
the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in    2.3151931128325933
first aid. Other steps would be developed after information drifts down    1.3519245690952306
to the local level from the federal government.   2.962696373291819
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible    1.756740510386871
revisions in mind.   Governor Notte said last night he    1.3773037385150428
plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations    1.9514383354117195
for possible changes in time for the next session of the General    2.033067736518772
Assembly.   The governor's move into the so-called "blue    1.5382238266881139
law" controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R&    1.9130937957217848
Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy was released to    1.3332704618644369
the press.   Mr& Notte was responding to a resolution adopted    1.4194290853621323
by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state    5.348704615212495
house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges the governor to have a    1.669924791185786
complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision    1.8040438235647525
at the next session of the legislature.   While the city    2.756295631633853
council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review,    1.4173623461797198
Mr& Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty&    1.7487087218091852
Gen& J& Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views".    1.8869439595510924
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr& Nugent's    1.5270361464911257
cooperation, the governor said.   "I would expect the proposed    1.4232291798309933
committee to hold public hearings", Mr& Notte said, "to obtain    1.465740813956929
the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest    1.925094352620209
groups affected by these laws".   The governor wrote    1.3747496942964894
Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "with the continuous    2.172260052943338
problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers    1.4861602065247228
as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales".   The    2.2983926659237928
attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce    1.7106541772263966
the blue laws. Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has    1.4271415651767312
said, the state police will step into the situation.   There    1.8571165831883445
has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in    1.8855164037805419
Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales    1.6026838078227632
laws. The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island    1.4673736538439526
and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit    1.3968991268446052
the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.   The    1.5054768469663051
Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more    1.368964917653733
foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery    1.510977796613218
and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.   The only    1.487019893900623
day they "have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on    1.8015250699136514
Sunday", the council's resolution said. The small shops "must    1.3549252613941032
be retained, for they provide essential service to the community",    1.6119812484890357
according to the resolution, which added that they "also are the source    2.262893518423561
of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares that    1.2970440268020442
Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue" to the local government.   1.4395402139304188
The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets,    1.5314281881231617
factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business"    1.4302560382222973
on Sunday. They "operate on a volume basis", it was contended,    1.3589490699869176
"and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital    1.7826705317844802
shopping needs of the community".   1.793276241538196
Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic and    1.3101671322937039
Republican- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties,    1.2603297756157776
George H& Reama, nationally known labor-management expert, said    1.223747250046758
here yesterday.   Mr& Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence    1.3451570005465603
at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about    1.536880906262682
half of the people in the country want the "welfare" type of government    2.779686096163321
and the other half want a free enterprise system. He suggested    2.372153520419952
that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull    1.5934213057199613
at the right lever for him on election day.   He said he was "confessing    2.564785637641903
that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910".    3.2653408123613734
That, he added, was when he was "a very young man, a machinist and    2.369797466018574
toolmaker by trade.   "That was before I studied law. Some    1.4430842484428135
of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist    1.5699860426214731
Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist    1.4915644420946856
track. He steered me to the right track- the free enterprise track".   1.8079760813101393
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party    6.144881327737417
called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of    1.4873778632519152
all resources. He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever    1.4063798570255315
gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to    1.6145904754272895
pass under both major parties.   Mr& Reama, who retired as vice    1.3273421078362682
president of the American Screw Co& in 1955 said, "Both parties    11.598142825020958
in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth    2.663427298044753
in the gross national product- but neither told us how to achieve it".   2.067917577715514
He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but manufacturers    1.739675038409378
are caught in a profit squeeze"- and raises should only    1.2978082289616597
come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.   1.6411506427592932
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy,    4.0648568536892835
Mr& Reama said: "A Socialist is a person who believes    1.4648248136426294
in dividing everything he does not own". Mr& Reama, far from    1.6400174695906211
really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.   1.396374282067876
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston    5.523121169328376
taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped    1.7181525015994128
will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.   2.451175769206099
William A& Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group    2.1525323203108564
of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right    1.4846790093967912
hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council    1.6347722394849007
President Raymond Fortin Sr&.   The law which governs    1.2601428110892354
home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the    1.8015232246116737
chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures    2.1615596547548845
within 10 days and Mr& Martinelli happens to hold that post.   2.1494354848298656
Mr& Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough    1.7013327631557869
signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter    1.7287559615241417
and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70    2.088980262190798
days. He explained that by law the council must establish procedures    1.4063208711114756
for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers    8.093808373665029
completes its work.   A difference of opinion arose between Mr&    1.480766406168224
Martinelli and John P& Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact    1.389957150156743
manner in which the vote is handled. Mr& Martinelli has, in recent    1.7839335616336909
weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called    1.6540567050449417
for the vote, while Mr& Bourcier said that a special election    2.3749316574843404
might be called instead.   Mr& Bourcier said that he had consulted    2.060610243588586
several Superior Court justices in the last week and received    1.8748515197895623
opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr& Martinelli and    1.2782984463031217
the council that he would study the correct method and report back to    1.855716351156241
the council as soon as possible.   Mr& Martinelli said yesterday    1.9185270442156992
that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to    6.930593153279301
plan further strategy in the charter movement. He said that the group    2.091009107409681
has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but    1.7268619459085246
that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.   1.9022395093569913
"After inspiring this, I think we should certainly follow through    1.4559693125544408
on it", he declared. "It has become our responsibility and I    1.7219706471558982
hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement".    1.7410963890210864
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members    8.755542348552165
of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan    2.390618112265206
ballot for posts on the charter commission.   "Our most immediate    1.4196414305115284
goal is to increase public awareness of the movement", he indicated,    1.669987347308012
"and to tell them what this will mean for the town". He expects    1.9628398337153665
that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled    1.7175236867350006
during the last week in September.   Some opposition to the home    2.5146008001068294
rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the    1.4937477646072483
town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home    1.3680783684872946
rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.    1.5572229126252708
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.   1.6372778531897787
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter    1.7421131329559256
was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain    1.622130463960662
signatures under what were termed "false pretenses". Several signers    1.213918937591122
affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax    1.4942667442133608
increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly    2.0033925081798745
and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town    2.4228244566029105
take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.   1.4418200297143153
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty    1.4645307877425418
to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may    1.4168317380414357
be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.   1.4885964040460253
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday    1.1692817185414583
he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A&    1.4706364625200326
Abatuno to draft the ordinance.   At the last session of the    1.6167641512894446
General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance    1.4595230129297025
as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.    2.0164530427734357
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.   1.8076235148262059
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District    1.8732861289374163
Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated to prosecute them    1.2733092420012586
because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.    1.9961801316248604
_PLAINFIELD_- James P& Mitchell and Sen& Walter H& Jones    1.3674066239576164
~R-Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign    1.6163778005866254
issue a remark by Richard J& Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial    1.3924137396313214
candidate, that the ~GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass    1.499385207448395
of Eisenhower Republicanism".   Mitchell was for using it, Jones    1.3070155091681805
against, and Sen& Wayne Dumont Jr& ~R-Warren did not    1.29373833543536
mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke    1.5143617973637151
at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel.    6.385098514060716
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield    1.3453497425043897
Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains    1.3161754733651165
Country Club. It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in    4.3418804661930555
Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.   1.6826258124290376
Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention of    2.0695692103158287
the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower    1.9413246274579103
Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood    1.3630171421099506
congealed after Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican    1.2783877888263082
Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the    2.221325382943913
people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We can love Eisenhower    1.8084149823118092
the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president **h but    1.58522084645104
there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership".   2.5387773542583676
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue    1.5980363884667261
in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can a man with any degree    2.360144624994403
of common decency charge this"? he asked. The former secretary    1.394604323236376
