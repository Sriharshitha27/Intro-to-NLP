Now , in this lecture I plan to cover discuss the general characteristics of ionic chain polymerization , and while discussing I will compare how this ionic chain polymerization compares with radical chain polymerization .   3.166133672220681
And then we will go to cationic chain polymerization and talk about different types of initiation for cationic chain polymerization , and then go to propagation and termination reactions in cationic chain polymerization .   4.069858073281838
And then I will talk about kinetics of cationic chain polymerization and then energetics of cationic chain polymerization .   3.3435559927331022
Now , let us begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .   2.4016027366852515
Now , as the name suggest , in this case the initiation is from an anionic species , whether it is a cation or anion .   4.5189080207859735
It could be acceptance of electron giving rise to a radical anion or removal of an electron , which gives to radical cation , which two of which might combine to give you a dianion or a dication which can further initiate the chain reactions from both the sides .   3.140344037616715
This is a case of cationic polymerization and this two are the case of anionic polymerization .   6.835107584026139
Now , in this case , the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species , so as the propagating species also ionic .   3.9774716934260494
Now , like radical chain polymerization , these ionic chain polymers , polymerization reactions are not very popular commercially .   3.8122499063944963
One is that stringent requirement of polymerization in case of this ionic polymerization .   4.400087580242098
We require very , stringest , stringent conditions , which are difficult to achieve in a large industrial scale and also , this ionic polymerization are very selective , which means , that not every monomer can be polymerized by ionic polymerization , unlike , unlike radical case where most of the , poly , monomers , double bond monomers can be polymerized by radical chain polymerization we can assume .   4.052097327780942
So , these are the main two reasons why this ionic chain polymerization , are not practiced that commercially in that scale .   3.0829639681656325
And so in that sense , it is not that important like radical chain polymerization .   4.015006052795469
First is that as I just said , that it is , it is much more selective , much more selective .   3.903529982131618
Now , for anionics , for anionic chain polymerization we need to have monomers , which have electron withdrawing group , electron withdrawing group , which could be , as we discussed earlier , something like this , acrylates or methacrylates , and , and so on , with this can be polymerized anionically because the resulting anion can be stabilized by this resonating with the carbonyl bond .   4.513471884666416
So , in that sense , this anionic and cationic polymerization at very and only if the monomer has , monomer with , monomers with , with inductive effect and ability to stabilize the propagating species by resonance in the , both for cationic and anionic , then this monomers can be polymerized by both cationic and anionic .   3.641093600850273
For example , you have styrene where both cationic and anionic can be stabilized by resonance with this aromatic proof or say , cation , resulting cation or anionic can be stabilized by resonance from this double bond .   2.8330995123472866
While in case of radical we have seen , that all this , this monomers or this monomers or this can be all polymerized by radical chain polymerization .   4.303402790763537
So , in that case , in that composition radical is a , radical chain polymerization is much least sensitive compared to the ionic polymerization .   4.454144820879115
It is not only polarity , but the capability of the solvent molecules to solvate the ionic species giving the chain propagation .   3.846670004473535
Now , as you have seen earlier , that a propagation reaction can be this .   4.088095246056639
It is either cationic species or anionic species .   3.586819609228092
Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion .   3.975656581107394
So , this propagating chain are always of this ionic group , are always accompanied by a counter ion of oppositely charged , that is always happens .   3.4099387875203773
Now , depending on the association behavior of these two species , the active center and the counter ion , the reactivity of the propagating species varies .   4.242668059937028
What I mean , that if they are very tightly bound , they are very tight , then obviously , the accessibility of , or the reactivity of this ionic center are less .   4.5748075014869904
So , the propagating species is less reactive .   5.007938514779288
While if you compare with the situation where they are well separated , they are like free , free hands .   3.3161931542462444
Now , if they are free , then obviously , they are more accessible and the reactivity of this propagating species , ionic propagating species are much more reactive or much more reactive compared to situation when they are tight ion - pair .   4.094948379918323
So , it is always preferred , that you have a polar solvent , it is , this is always preferred .   4.923759322193075
So , you have a higher rate of reaction or an eventually higher molecular build up .   4.415413029988435
Now , often if you use polar solvent , for example if you use hydroxylated solvents , hydroxylated solvents like say , H 2 O or alcohol , what happens ?   3.5868812722305092
This , this reacts , this hydroxylated solvents react very , very fast , you know , very effectively they react with this ionic species and then stop the chain .   3.284162880205607
So , you do not have an effective polymerization happening .   3.275383096350176
So , eventually or practically , a low to moderate polarity solvents like , say methylene chloride or say , methylene dichloride or THF , or ether or nitrobenzene .   2.370443852594826
They , they actually can be used for ionic species polymerization , but this is , these are not very generic in the sense , that the solvents , this solvents also can react with anionic species as well .   4.533756775884037
So , we have , we will discuss specifically for the requirement of solvent .   4.7123159127861864
We will talk about cationic and anionic polymerization individually .   3.536323815943207
Now , how this , if you want to write a , a generic structure of , say , to write , write a cationic propagating species , which have , which a cationic reactive centre and a counter ion , which is represented by A minus , so what are the possible states they can represent ?   3.7334423458223824
One , they can be completely covalent bonding , covalent bonded , covalent bonded , one .   2.857935265705473
So , tight ion - pair or sometimes it is called contact ion - pair or see , some people say intimate ion - pair .   2.968868788211173
It can be present as solvated .   4.461777852246461
So , solvated has three solvated ion - pair or loose ion - pair or they can be totally free , free ion - pair .   2.9777977099528514
So , these are the possible , depending upon the polarity of the medium this could the four possible association state between these two ionic species .   3.1857120375655543
Now , it , we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is B plus , is said the both cationic polymerization , the propagating species in cationic polymerization .   3.4855427447734946
But it can be true ; this post can be true for the other anionic polymerization as well .   3.691900693320498
So , which means and in some cases these , these are not present isolately , they actually remain in equilibrium and equilibrium shifts depending upon the polarity of the medium .   3.1869456301092365
And if you compare with radical chain polymerization , solvent polarity actually has no such role to play in case of radical chain polymerization .   3.4675465472406537
You have to only check whether the solvent can solubilize the monomer or the reagent and it , solvent should not participate in the undesired chain transfer reactions .   3.5735122846407963
So , this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization .   3.3030438434295895
So , third characteristic we can talk about and compare the nature of reaction .   3.4260292427842685
Now , this , these are complex reactions as we will find out from further discussion , that these are complex reaction and they are very fast .   4.793841120074784
So , they are very fast and this fast nature of this reaction is due to the fact , that the accumulation of this active centers .   4.043494849235172
One cation cannot react with another cation , cationic propagating species and terminate the reactions in case of radical .   3.4435366693894998
But in case of radicals we have seen , that the steady state concentration of the active radicals is very low and as a result , the propagation was comparatively low in a slower , in compression to these ionic polymerization .   4.839603477250046
Cocatalyst are nothing but small inorganic compounds , like say H 2 O , can be observed in case of ionic polymerization have , which was not the case of radical polymerization .   3.6564575541149598
And as I said earlier , this four is your , the termination reactions .   2.6782568493408108
As I said , that bimolecular termination is not possible , bimolecular termination by the action of two propagating species is not possible and so if you can suppress the other , other reactions , which are chain transfer reaction , if you can suppress those , you can actually keep this chains , this ionic chains as living because you can , because the inherent or intrinsic termination reaction between the propagating species are not there , they are absent .   4.260257300294427
You will find out in later discussion , that in case of cationic there are other ways , which are likely like chain transfer reactions , but in case of anionic it is comfortably easy to make polymerization , leaving chain polymerization .   4.205739290459128
Whereas , in case of radical , we know , that this termination can be possible by bimolecular reaction of the two propagating new species .   4.445045010874647
So , let us now talk in detail about the cationic polymerization .   2.872464646834738
So , let us talk about and again , like radical polymerization if any chain polymerization , this cationic chain polymerization we were discussing .   4.584707668794472
Now , HX would be strong enough if these acids should be stronger enough to produce significant concentration of the protonal species , so that it can initiate , react with the monomer .   3.1256808778186675
For example , if I consider a case of halogen acids like HX and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond .   3.829448391314846
So , your reaction stops there .   2.215647724381259
You cannot have the reaction progressing further .   2.777107035325707
So , so other protonic acids like H 2 SO 4 or say , HClO 4 or phosphoric acid .   2.3244955615228213
So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation .   4.5879270533364105
So , most , most popular , most important , this electrophilic reaction is reaction of Lewis acids .   2.520278964438341
So , these are Lewis , Lewis acid can be used for supplying an electrophile for reaction with the monomer , but it is this Lewis acids are seldom used alone .   4.290261016595019
We will just give examples in few minutes .   2.9765102492040003
So , if you consider this case the reaction happens like this .   3.8621685261641963
BF 3 plus H 2 O makes a complex or we can use other Lewis acids and we can use this alkyl halides as a cocatalyst and this case , the complex found is like this .   4.16186543159387
So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor .   5.595000658269345
This is coinitiator , coinitiator , BF 3 or AlCl 3 are , sometimes they are called this BF 3 or AlCl 3 , called catalyst and this initiator called cocatalyst .   3.2624412438065575
So , you should be careful about this nomenclature , other you called this as initiator and coinitiator or you called this as catalyst and this is the cocatalyst .   3.6817041107749175
Similarly , you can write this similar reaction for this aluminum chloride and alkyl halide reaction .   3.3692212973031723
This alkyl halide could be , say for example , R could be tertiary carbon or could be a triphenyl carbon group .   3.304841982628248
This is I and which then react with a monomer forming the chain initiating spices .   3.9666904137538497
Now , we are writing ki for this reaction because it has been found out , that of these two reactions , this is the two reactions , consists of chain reaction , chain initiation reaction .   5.391767152784299
So , we will consider this reaction while calculating or while determining the , or looking at the kinetics of this chain polymerization .   3.6884880054125895
Remember , if you compare with the radical chain polymerization , this was the first reaction compared to the step , the first step , where radical was getting generated from the initiator molecule and we considered that as a rate determining step for radical chain polymerization .   4.56422158947438
But in this ionic chain polymerization we , this is the faster reaction step where this is the slower and rate determining step .   5.899338458981503
So , for ionic reaction monomer also participate in the chain initiation reaction where in case of radical monomer was not actually part of the chain initiating expression Now , the reaction rate also depend , depends on this YZ , which is basically a cocatalyst .   4.913745694886947
It will also influence the polymerization rate because the activity of the initiation complex depends how readily it can transfer a proton to the monomer and that in turn depends on the acidity of this cocatalyst .   4.085625674379469
So , basically the type of cocatalyst also influence the polymerization because the acidity of this , this complex , the activity of this complex depends on how readily it can supply this cationic species , where I say proton or in this case it is a proton or a carbocation to the monomer , and for a proton or protogen or a proton supplier , it depends on the acidity of the cocatalyst .   4.03628090706083
So , it follows this trend and for the carbon cationic generator like RCl , like AlCl 3 plus , this reaction .   3.25726117300311
Obviously , I , the catalyst or the coinitiator also affects the rate of polymerization .   2.579797321106847
For a single metal follow this trend of the ligand .   3.243851283419956
If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come .   4.323515201064721
Now , there are other initiation reactions , other initiation reactions , for example , halogen , halogen can be reacting with more acidic Lewis acid and gives out cation , halogen cation .   2.827927043701752
But as I mentioned in earlier , these are the generic examples , which we get in this page .   5.013836549294801
These are the most common example of or the most important initiation reaction .   4.3187073773868745
So , let us now discuss the propagation step .   2.5185190181993096
So , you have this initiator , coinitiator complex , which starts the chain initiation .   3.5931274459509033
I write this in the next page , it can react with the name and start the chain propagation reaction and I can write a generic expression of this in this way plus M kp n plus 1 M plus IZ minus .   4.814820510908266
I just recall from your earlier decision , I am writing the propagating reactions here .   2.9196908576340217
This , on reacting on with isobutylene , will produce the.. ... So , these are the examples of the propagating steps and sometimes this propagation reaction could be complicated and because of this one two hydride shift , but that is not very common .   3.642259385435388
I will just give you an example when this propagating steps could be little complicated and by hydride shift or shift and that is applicable for say , propene or one alkene , one alkenes , take example .   3.458964138757392
Now , this can undergo a hydride shift and from this carbo cation .   3.3511162288247864
If this happens , the reactions become very complicated and we call that sometimes isomerization polymerization as well .   3.3321263297279797
The example we gave , most common propagation steps are in this page , what we just discussed now and as you can realize , that the rate of propagation will depend on the solvents .   4.405543746327259
So , the rate of polymerization will be higher .   3.314773185555217
Now , let us have , let us see some data related to convince that understanding .   3.4650994666580046
Say , let us take example of styrene , polymerization of styrene by or chloric acid HClO 4 solvent is a mixture of CCl 4 and ethylene dichloride .   2.9028898000518724
If you have pure CCl 4 , obviously , this is more non - polar , dielectric constant is 2.3 and the rate is low .   4.793181703572035
When you increase the polarity by adding ethylene dichloride , dichloethane , EU , say in 40 - 60 mixture , your dielectric constant goes up , your reaction goes up .   2.8579816271270038
For example , one beta proton transfer to either monomer or counter ion or say polymer itself , solvent or some impurities , which is present or a transfer agent , like the case of chain radical polymerization , we talk about the chain transfer is possible .   4.8547914012963735
And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , I can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization .   4.0129611638239355
So , one , depending on which proton is leaving you can get actually two structures with double bond .   3.213874271485269
For example , like you have alpha methane styrene in case of , say , example , the monomers like styrene , where you always get only one possible double bond because there is only one possible beta hydrogen to be eliminated .   4.106767529064289
We have been discussing so far the steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors .   2.500989510196818
JD factor is defined as a lumped parameter which takes into an account the mass transfer coefficient particularly field diffusion coefficient as well as the reactor operational parameters .   3.2707522228309367
The JD factor is JD factor = ( kL ?   1.87545169352496
The first term in the parenthesis represents the mass transfer function ; the other is dimensional number which gives you the operational parameters and here kL is a mass transfer coefficient ; ?   4.17111698216789
It has been shown at least empirically in a large number of experimental data that JD is equal to JD = C ( Re ) - n A very general relationship for JD factor has been given that it ’ s a function of Renault number to the power minus n and under different conditions of particle shape and the range of Renault number the magnitude of C and n varies and that can be estimated for a particular system .   4.049908447355295
If you look at this one , you will notice that from the estimation of JD factor as a function of C , Renault number to the power minus n one can determine the value of kL .   4.019305488815405
The magnitude of kL then gives you at steady state , the reaction rate .   3.493317079408633
That is v ’ = kLam ( Sb - SS ) = rm Under steady state both the biochemical reaction and the mass transfer rate are equal .   3.8267892000745665
JD can be computed from a variety of correlations as I mentioned .   3.2862042133886296
This is only one of probably a large number of relationships that are reported in the literature of heterogeneous catalysis in chemical engineering .   4.163722702503339
For spherical particle JD is equal to JD = 1.625 ( NRe ) - 0.507 This is one of the relationships which have been proposed but a large number of such empirical correlations are known .   3.6621477897085715
For example in the case of CSTR , life is much simpler ; if the fractional conversion desired is very high even at a high initial substrate concentration , the substrate concentration in the reactor will be quite low and that is the substrate concentration which is going in the outlet stream .   4.7544080317604775
Similarly in the case of PFR , because the enzyme loading is very high usually in PFR , a large fraction of the reactor also experiences a low substrate concentration .   4.415615901199253
kf is equal to a pseudo first order rate constant for enzyme catalyzed reaction which is k ’ 2E0 / K ’ m .   4.117819190339452
Therefore rate of mass transfer is rm = kLam. ( Sb - SS ) In the case of a non - porous particle the issue is to develop an expression which gives you the substrate concentration at the surface because the reaction will take place at the surface of substrate concentration .   4.047239804997044
kf apparent will be kL.kf.am kappf = kf + kL In your reactor design equation you can incorporate , instead of first order rate constant as this one which is based only on biochemical reaction , this rate expression .   3.2691635451060637
kappf can be used to designate the reactor performance of the first order immobilized enzyme reactor with film diffusion limitations or film diffusion control .   4.447547312132869
Even in chemical engineering that is very conventional thing ; only difference is that those catalysts are very , very stable interms of their thermal , operational as well as storage stability where as immobilized enzymes are not as stable .   3.930744531397953
But all the analysis is identical and Satterfield also provided a single point reactor performance equation based on film diffusion control for heterogeneous catalyst .   2.8743527482022593
If the mass transfer has to be incorporated this much of length of the reactor is required under these operational conditions to have the substrate concentration equivalent to biochemical reaction .   4.312799817702949
That means to make Sb - Ss equal to zero , without any biochemical reaction this much of height of the reactor is required under these operational conditions .   3.59571235328773
You simply design your reactor on the basis of biochemical reaction and be happy .   2.7961999577384358
On the other hand if this height required is reasonably high then you forget about biochemical reactions and design the reactor based on diffusional requirements based on the mass transfer coefficients .   3.1980293461841294
This is basically empirical equation depending upon the reaction operational data the height required for effecting the mass transfer across that film .   3.688823731294763
Yes . Exactly what we are assuming here is that there is no reaction within the pores of the particle .   3.4265799465102735
All the enzymes are present on the surface and in the thin film there is no reaction taking place .   4.858152946444086
You must appreciate the difference between the internal pore diffusion and external film diffusion while in the case of internal pore diffusion during the transport of the substrate in the particle reaction is also taking place whereas here there is no reaction taking place along with the mass transfer ; its only mass transfer .   4.121955416937841
If suppose there is no reaction taking place then along the length of the reactor at Z the substrate concentration will reach to Sb same as in bulk .   3.9744713363278654
It will take some time whereas if the biochemical reaction is also taking place at the substrate then that length required will be given by Z2 at substrate concentration Ss .   4.263365968880493
In the case of porous matrices a very large quantity of fraction of total enzyme which is immobilized is within the pores of the particle .   2.8743587577487575
The quantity of enzyme immobilized on the surface is in fact very , very small compared to total surface area in which the whole enzyme is distributed inside the pores of the reactor .   4.4769242440507195
Very broadly the effect of internal pore diffusion in a very simplistic way is described for isothermal reaction incorporated in the pore diffusional effects by k ’ 2E0Ss v ’ = ?   3.4501789057906422
But at the moment we are talking only of biochemical reaction and internal pore diffusion assuming that the transport through a film is fast enough and it does not create any problem .   3.8904624857154166
That means there is no concentration gradient across the film .   3.8294638597454664
In this case this is defined by a factor ?   3.760790019949401
which is called as effectiveness factor .   2.1018008747950594
This effectiveness factor is the ratio of the rate of actual reaction in the matrix divided by the maximum reaction rate obtainable if there was no pore diffusional resistance .   4.7966219657842215
That is if for example you take a particle let us say of one millimeter diameter ; determine the reaction rate and then also take a particle let us say of ten microns or twenty microns diameter in which we assume that the pore length is very , very small .   3.8908355529927667
Even if the diffusional rate is very slow the substrate can reach to all parts of the enzyme go down to as low as possible and the ratio of the two that means the maximum reaction rate which you can get when you go down in the particle size to that of the reaction rate which is obtained by a particular particle size is defined as the effectiveness factor .   5.503568588333031
You have Sb here ; you reached Ss ; there is no substrate concentration gradient but then here onwards there is a gradient .   3.8224300369841453
There are two things you must appreciate in contrast to the film diffusional effects .   3.03089487413985
One is that there is a rate of diffusion ; the substrate will take some time to reach to the different sites of the enzyme present in the pores .   5.9415071027932935
Ultimately when you will measure the enzyme activity you will see that the enzyme activity is low because per unit enzyme loading the activity which will be expressed by the immobilized enzyme particle will be lower .   4.787830879628512
So therefore if particle size is reduced you get an advantage that the fraction of the total particle which is receiving the substrate increases coming to one when the particle size is too small and usually in most cases as per the experimental experiences that a particle size about thirty microns in most cases of the biochemical reactions has been considered to give you an effectiveness factor of one .   4.032422376660883
That is what is the ultimate limit and the internal pore diffusion effects are described by effectiveness factor .   3.6001612540171033
The first condition will be the enzyme kinetics where substrate inhibition is very strong .   4.741605854381768
The enzymes that are very strongly substrate inhibited may show an effectiveness factor greater than one because the reaction rate when the substrate concentration drops becomes higher than at the surface .   3.8422611272350777
If the substrate concentration is high at the surface the reaction rate is low .   5.158310325341667
The other alternative case of the effectiveness factor exceeding unity is that of a case where we experience partitioning effects particularly … .   4.453643509739438
Take a typical example of alcohol dehydrogenase .   2.672011982425634
The reaction product ends up in hydrogen ions ; there will be a pH change and that pH change enhances the enzyme activity .   3.7492085347774338
So there are two extreme cases where effectiveness factor show discrepancy from the theoretical understanding .   2.95108579207577
In the case of strongly substrate inhibited enzymes , if the concentration of substrate at the surface is high then for substrate inhibited reaction , the reaction rate will be low and because of the pore diffusional parameter the substrate concentration across the pores is reducing .   5.033093815356881
As we saw here the substrate concentration goes down along the pores and substrate concentration going down means the react rate of reaction increases .   4.2476704636786025
No . When there is a partitioning of hydrogen ions and the conditions are such that the rate of reaction as a result of partitioning increases that is the condition .   4.7224375206594384
If the partitioning creates unfavorable conditions for the reaction then it will not be more than one .   5.461766842793831
Only when the hydrogen ions are produced and the micro environment created by the reaction in the form of product .   3.631792949677611
You must incorporate partitioning effects also in the steady state analysis .   3.4813655915289514
Then only you can compare .   2.8386332191140267
This is dx the length of differential element .   4.583017962744743
R is the radius of the pore .   4.813337968204475
dS / dx is negative and this is output of the substrate from the pore .   4.425749591800965
The conversion as a result of biochemical reaction is v ’ ( 2pR ) dx .   3.1699858107162653
If you rearrange you get ( ds / dx ) out - ( ds / dx ) in 2 - .v ’ = 0 dx RD If you take limit dx tends to zero you can write simply as the second order differential equation d2s / dx2 – 2 / DR .   3.794752215482809
No . Sorry diffusional coefficient will come here .   2.1220316468050417
It is not going .   4.921971778734047
We have multiplied here too or v / D either way .   2.8670095469397103
In today ’ s lecture we planned to cover interfacial polymerization , and we also will be talking about different synthesis of different step polymers in very brief briefly .   3.576300313290107
And at the end , I planned to just give a summary of this module on step growth polymerization .   2.8708981509806737
We also discussed various way of making branched and cross linked polymers .   2.8931616635086552
And we also studied in that context that in case of branching reaction going on the molecular build up is higher for a given conversion in comparison to a linear polymerization .   4.679057317288221
I mean by successful , I mean a building of the molecular weight of the polymer , which is targeted and in most cases it is a high molecular weight polymers .   3.822962936677063
Now , suppose you have done everything right , whatever instruction is given to you in the this course or in any text book , you have followed everything right .   2.876203185849843
You have taken monomers in a ratio very close to r is equal to 1 and you have done the reaction at high temperature for longer time , try to take out the condensate for you know as much as possible .   4.550648721837964
Now , what does it mean it does not mean it all the instruction given to you are incorrect , you have to deep you know look into deep what might have happened .   3.5369728278373485
And I just I will give you few guide line in the deep something goes wrong in spite of doing your best possible way ; now what are the things to look for and let us look one by one .   3.819250909591727
So , there is a guide line for trouble shooting , now you must be capturing the condensate in a trap will distilling of the condensate byproduct you must be you know must be collecting that in a trap .   3.613429281814366
Now , you analyze the end of the reaction , you analyze that that material in the trap and see whether you found any monomers in there .   3.9412152554536855
But still , because one of the monomers might have volatile in excess than other , which will imbalance your stoichiometric ratio and which will definitely going to decrease your final molecular weight .   3.4849350735967173
You can start slowly , which means that you take a you take the reaction and carry out the reaction for some time at a lower temperature and at atmospheric pressure .   5.147678637544775
Then their volatility tendency of volatility would come down as their molecule weight increases increased by this time .   2.635773271450037
So , what you can do in reaction you can do in the steps , you can do the first step in a lower temperature and at higher pressure and then slowly increase the temperature and reduce the pressure .   4.8070979940364
So , that is the one way you can reduce and the volatility of the vocalization of the monomers .   3.6971439712015015
And specially look for the chain stoppers which are mono functional molecules , if you find them which means it is as a result of degradation or a side reaction there would be either imbalance in the stoichiometry .   3.5928072814302126
Or there would be generation of this mono functional chain stopper , which will which will stop your polymer chains to progress further .   3.2517634396513375
So , that will again reduce the molecular weight build up .   3.9247397244271673
So , you might consider chaining the catalyst or even reducing catalyst amount in the reaction .   3.467496290159453
For example , if you have say during a polyester formation , if you have something like this , there is one more very common side reaction is happens is by beta elimination reaction .   4.366332902258017
So , third thing you can do as I was mentioning is that you change the catalyst or sometimes catalyst a I said might accelerate the side reactions as well .   3.942214800874734
And if you are doing in a solution , you are doing this poly step polymerization reaction solution , then you can also try and change the solvent .   4.780121615461514
Now , so these are the things you can try out , if your reaction goes wrong and of course , if this nothing else work with this you might have to consider changing your reaction monomer , you are changing your monomers all together .   3.8213489111659573
For example , if you have diacid chloride , chloride plus diol forming polyester polyester , say diacid chloride plus diamine polyamide .   2.9589660858353226
And this first reaction are you know the has been taken that , this the fastness of these reactions has been taken .   4.391945493761254
And it has been used in making polymers by interfacial polymerization .   3.867660576967917
Interfacial polymerization reactions are happened in the interface between 2 liquid phase , 2 monomers are taken in two different liquid phase and the reaction happen in the interface .   3.870652523130075
Now , this at the interface react with phosgene forming this come out which again with reaction with this phenolate salt will form a dimer in this case and reaction will proceed further in this way .   4.064440854101575
So , this is a very slow reaction , if you do the reaction in this way this will give you a very slow reaction .   4.949447293053703
So , what is done to tackle this problem a tri a amine is added in the organic medium , say triethylamine or trimethylamine and when this reacts with this species it is form a salt now this is water soluble .   3.5679187642213828
So , then the reaction of this two reacting species will be happening in the organic side of the interface .   4.646391437652518
Bisphenol a poly carbonate is having this commercial trade names , I will be giving all this you know some of the trade names of this polymers in the next few slides as well .   3.7665112896299573
So , what are the characterize , for the characteristic for the interfacial polymerization we just discussed one that polymerization occurs the interfacial of two liquids and each of the liquid phase contains one reactant .   3.4696359932252747
So , you do not need not to maintain a stoichiometry of say very close to one is to one like the other linear poly condensation reaction here .   3.606672244474775
Because , the stoichiometry are the interface is always maintained at one is to one , because reaction is not happening in the valve phase of the two monomers it is happening only at the interface and because reaction happening one is to one .   3.8382833071785987
Now , the reaction is fast , so the when the monomer defuse to the interface immediately it find a chain end reactive chain end and in reacts before even can approach to the other monomer , which means that this unlike this linear poly condensation reaction , which talked about it happens in a kinetic control way and it is very fast .   4.137591460278574
So , what is the outcome that molecular build up is much easier , because the as soon as the monomers defuse from the bulk to interface it reacts with the chain end and the chain grows one after one .   4.242382634953093
So , the chain grows in size , so it is very you know it is comparatively much easier to build molecular weight .   4.5466276390053135
And as the reactions are happening or the monomers is getting added at the end of the chain , high molecular weight even possible at low conversion .   4.616911621340832
And because the diffusion is slower compared to the actual reaction , polymerization reaction this reaction this polymerization reaction are often diffusion controlled .   4.018095276309832
So , what are the requirements for a successful inter polymerization interfacial polymerization you need to have a inorganic base , which you require to neutralize the produce HCl otherwise HCl with go back and hydrolyze the salt .   3.495045830250372
And the other way also you should restrict or minimize the acid chloride hydrolysis , because if it hydrolyze and form a plane alcohol , then it will just acid chloride if it hydrolyze to form simple acid carboxylic acid .   3.6975754791788153
Proper choice of solvent , you must be taken and you need , because this reaction is happening interface .   4.25916863866297
So , product might will form much faster rate , if you are not starting the reaction .   3.3929501233681916
So , what are the disadvantage in spite of all this advantages , this is not this interfacial polymerization are not practiced very frequently commercially , so there must be some disadvantages .   3.854600647167416
So , it is is not very economic in true sense and as you as you saw that we have to use wider lot of organic solvent and handling that large amount of organic solvent recycling them , and storing them and is a environmental hazard as well storing and handling them this organic solvent .   3.649567271736819
Now , also polymers if you with it is presented in a solution most and most commonly in the organic solvent .   2.9852758663815027
So , you have to at the end of the polymerization you have to take out the poly carbonate by steam precipitation if you steam precipitation .   3.6065010561405906
So , there are always chances of having more impurities , compared to if you are doing in a bulk condition or a in a solution pure solution and also it is a batch process it is very difficult to do it continuously and as this reaction is kinetically controlled .   4.757358868427346
The chances of forming cyclics are much more , because cyclics are not reacting with the byproduct and forming the linear product once again , which means once cyclics forms it will remain in the final product .   3.196125768030809
So , now we move to the different polymers , in coming few slides I just wanted to give you the standard synthetic process of the common commercial step polymers .   3.590026315074152
I just wanted to give you a brief idea of different types of step polymers and how they are synthesized commercially , just in a very brief .   4.302289370943678
We will start with polyester and just example we will take is the most important and most used polyester poly ethylene terephthalate .   3.9431918714292404
This is the structure we have been showing you many times , these are several ways you can see synthesis PET Poly Esters Terephthalate , you can do take a ethylene ethylene glycol and diacid terephthalate acid .   4.332227957899606
And direct reaction you can take instead of terephthalate acid you can take dimethyl ester of terephthalate acid you can take acid chloride and acid an hydride and so on an hydride and so on .   3.2131333387092953
What did the commercial way of synthesis or the most practiced the synthetic process of making polyester or poly ethylene terephthalicin .   2.594501865013232
This case is by ester exchange it can be done either starting from dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid or from terephthalic acid itself .   3.231837561349055
And then these are now heated to a much higher temperature and the ethylene glycol is distilled out from the reaction .   3.928063084269343
So , between two of this molecules exchange ester exchange happen and as you take out this ethylene glycol from the system polymerization medium the polymer start growing slowly this is the .   4.611236179884848
And another way of making the PET is instead of taking dimethyl terephthalate , you can start with terephthalicacid and make first this an then follow the same process .   3.1338722587620533
We will move to the next class of polymers step polymers polyamides and we have this is linear poly polymerization reactions this is aliphatic diamine with aliphatic diacid you can directly under go reaction to form linear polyamide .   3.528005724479972
Now , in last slide we saw aliphatic diamine and aliphatic diacids , now we want to move to the aliphatic diamines and aliphatic diester or diacid chloride in this case .   3.472763240817334
And these this polyamides are completely formed from aromatic groups containing aromatic groups .   2.7263607886443153
So , these are aromatic polyamides and commonly known as aramid polymers and because the reactivity of this nitrogen attach to the aromatic ring is much less compared to if it as a simple aliphatic aliphatic aliphatic group .   3.556266301814736
So , typically in case of aromatic polyamide synthesis , aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic diacid chloride and you get this completely aromatic polyamides .   3.6000254209971114
Instead of you can use the para substituted diamine with para substitute diacids to form this linear polyamides aromatic polyamides .   2.938733804237217
So , these are very high polymers which are high very high performance polymers we move to next say we have just given generic example of branching and cross linking in last lecture .   4.188836413987321
Here , we I show you a definite examples you have ethyl an hydride here and we have a glycerol , when it reacts in this to reacts it form a linear chain along with a branch coming from this hydroxyl group .   3.8185775003267164
So , this is how you can carry out a there is a one example of forming bunch you know synthesis bunch polyester .   3.9550743696606108
So , you have synthesized in this way a unsaturated polyester .   4.211299808127911
So , here you first make a step polymers , by step polymerization mechanism you make a unsaturated polyester , and then by doing a chain reaction you can do a cross linking reaction to form a cross linking reaction .   4.090638873304287
If this instauration is at the end of the polyester , which you formed then these are known as alkyd polyesters , how do you do that , the same reaction like in this case phthalic an hydride glycerol there you are hiding one mono functional acids , which has a alkene group a double bond at the other end .   3.9159935719935013
These are typically you know , these are available in the fatty acid there are lots of fatty acid which are which can be unsaturated available where you have a unsaturation or double bond in a other side not necessary end , but other side .   4.219104643211466
Now , this double bond is free to undergo chain polymerization .   4.50202496562507
So , you can first stage you do a step polymerize to syntheses this and then you can take this and do a second step of chain polymerization either by oxidizing this or no using the other methods .   4.4623253280109685
So , you can carry out the reaction with this the salt of phenolate phenolate ion and you can make a polymers like linked this .   4.177539628742598
They are partially crystalline this PEEK and PEK poly ether ether ketone and polyether ketone they are partially crystalline polymers they have a T g around this range and they have a very high melting point .   3.599086730937734
So , they also used in applications where string and link requirement for high temperature .   3.4630169068751036
There are also amorphous T g is very high and their continuous use temperature is 300 to 350 degree centigrade temperature .   3.9821594481883253
I am just moving it fast , because this just information I my aim is to just give you the generic synthetic procedure for this class of step polymers .   3.297006128375326
But just for this course I am just giving you a over view of this different step polymer and just generic method of synthesizing this .   3.304654044394827
So , we move to polyether imides again this is the process of making polyether imides and these are again very high heat polymers ; that means , this having very capability of you know they can be used in very high temperature .   4.70529380603012
So , in the if the application required that you the polymer will should be present at this high temperature .   4.372096971047582
So , you can use ultem as your material ; obviously , these polymers are costly , because they have , so high performance and they are also difficult to synthesize there are the same time much costlier then the common polymers .   4.140309873499156
And this is sold as a trade name as turlon , this is also very high heat polymer , this is also amorphous T g having 270 to 285 and the constant use temperature is 220 to 235 .   3.678603794866574
Now , there are other step there are several other step polymers , which you know because of time or this course of this polymers is not to go through the detailed synthesis procedure of this polymers .   4.1137036523967465
So , there are this is just a to mention that there are other step polymers as well listed in this slide .   4.226483199338621
And which you can go through any text book or any standard publications to find out , if you are interested how they are synthesized and what are their property you know basic property .   4.0478500575176355
So , what I wanted to do next to just give you idea about step copolymers , now if you have say a amino acid R COH and NS 2 R double dash COH .   3.5063553249494537
Now , obliviously it will form , now why do we put the bracket will be always next to each other should I put the bracket here and put N like this , it may not be it could be somewhere here and there could be another bracket here .   4.1744422411297455
And if you have two different group in side then you can make a copolymer , but this has not very regularly used method from making copolymer , if you the practiced methods are normally if you say , if you are making a polyester , if you have say CH 2 CH 2 OH ethylene glycol .   4.083316577692384
Now , you have to make the total of these total of this diol with the ratio of this thing is close to one is to one .   3.960320317225744
So , total number of functional group of OH group is almost close to the number of groups of COH group , so that the polymers take place .   4.445497998937116
So , this a example of copolymers of PET and PBT polyethylene terephthalate copolybutylene terephthalate depending upon the ratio of these two you know which in which one will be higher or not .   4.492453830986405
Now , what do you except when you make this copolymer will there be alternative copolymer , that mean will you have this ethylene glycol group .   3.8323933464638444
And butylene glycol group butylene glycol group always next to each other will we expect that or will you expect that there be will random copolymers .   2.676734250564989
So , they reshuffle all the time you know during entire reaction there always reshuffling happening between the chains .   3.3182458654592732
So , during the reaction time the byproducts also taking part in the reverse reaction and also the intermediate chains they are also reacting with each other by exchange ester exchange .   4.243574217918341
If I take this BPA and bisphenol a and also some other di hydroxyl group say something else some substituted group here , instead of methyl we have ethyl group or some other group .   3.0262334246697704
Because , they very fast reaction once the product is formed the byproduct HCl is getting neutralized with sodium hydroxide , which means there is one reaction is formed .   3.343206150119094
They are not taking part in the reshuffling reactions which means the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of this group .   3.9622831073991662
If they are different , then the most react in a more reactive group would react faster forming a block , then the second monomer would react forming a another block .   3.6765483115805035
So , in this case because it is a kinetically controlled fast reaction reactivity of the reacting monomers would determine , whether its form a random copolymer or a or a block a copolymer .   3.794979849710037
If there are significant differences in the reactivity of the two diols then there will be a blocky nature in the copolymers .   3.7423105585738177
The nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of the functional groups of the monomers , if there are significant difference in the reactivity of the functional groups among the comonomers .   3.855568018324031
Then there will be blocky nature , in the copolymer resulting copolymers , if there is no reactivity difference then there is no .   4.9398681926143535
So , we have come to the end of this module and what we will do now , I want to tell my expectation you know what are the learning objective in this module in the step growth polymerization ; now what I expect from a student after going through this module .   3.9740930690905683
Let us , go one by one I expect that a student after going through this module should understand the mechanistic differences between step and chain copolymers , chain polymerization should which polymerization , so it should be polymerization .   3.0457221444479137
So , I expect that a student should understand the mechanistic difference between chain and step polymerization , if I stop a reaction after some conversion , what you expect in the polymerization medium , how the molecular weight build up with time and so on .   3.7422513592515236
If I give you a structure of the of the polymer synthetic polymer , then you should be able to identify by which process it has been synthesized , whether it is a step polymers polymerization process or a chain polymerization process .   4.99071740710883
Just by looking at the structure you should be able to tell or you should be able to identify , what is the difference you know in which method by which method it has been synthesized .   4.157164769809193
You should know the relationship between X n bar the number average degree of polymerization with r the stoichiometry ratio and p the conversion in a normal step polymerization process .   3.933652996939225
And you know by then this car others equation and you also should appreciate that the fact to make high polymer high molecular weight polymer you should have p value close to one .   3.948030690531191
And I have given few example during my lectures you should be able to calculate the M n there the number average molecular weight from X n the degree number average degrees of polymers .   3.8325949002530715
And so as M W from X w you know number average with weight average molecular weight from , weight average degree of polymerization .   3.351832650769716
And if you at the end to the polymer if you do not want to have any reactive functional group , then you should use mono functional chain stoppers and your molecular weight , when you use a chain stoppers , what is your target molecular weight you know the calculation hence you should be knowing the calculation .   4.754296484333429
From the kinetics of step polymerization you should understand that you know to achieve high conversion and as a result high molecular weight .   4.112510362561891
The what are the preferred conditions you know it should be external catalyzed it should be open driven system where you your systems should have ability to take out the small molecular byproduct as much as possible from the system .   3.823909507659858
And you must continue the reaction for long time , because the kinetics is lower and also is always preferred is always preferable to have a high equilibrium constant , which will depend upon the reactive .   4.357659715494852
So , it will be easier for you to make high molecular even if you cannot remove the small molecular weight byproduct completely or quantity from the reaction medium .   3.8872690828825616
A student should know are expected to know the molecular distribution and polydispersity index in a step polymerization and we should also know that the for any high molecular step polymer the PDI should be close to 2 or as a matter of close to 2 .   3.8044189407913973
And the same time he should or she should know , what are the ways you can minimize the cycling formation in a step polymerization .   3.8404624794018867
And if you do not what are the monomers you should not use for branching and you should also know the utility , if you what sometimes it is undesired to have branching in the polymer .   4.072511400701395
And sometimes it is deliberately you know wanted it is deliberate somebody , who will deliberately want to include want the branching or cross linking in the polymers .   2.7177374228805826
And in case following all the normal process normal directions , if you do not build high molecule weight what are the first things to look for , what are the common trouble shooting ?   4.185556263850806
And in also know different what are the common step polymers , what are their property and what are the different ways of making step polymers , same polymers can be making different ways .   3.9371730855767786
And finally , different commercial polymers you know student have a idea at least you should not I do not expect that a master of all the polymers , step polymers there as many step polymers .   3.509783113395357
At least I have some idea that these are the polymers are made by synthesized by step polymerization mechanism and one the most common ways of synthesized I have given examples in today ’ s lecture for quite a few .   4.220171679297492
So , I would expect that which are not covered in this in this lecture you please read the book or any other text to go through the common synthetic method for those polymers as well .   3.8896901933105736
So , with this I conclude this module on step growth polymers and polymers and polymerization step growth polymerization mechanism .   3.54065501809204
And next lecture onwards I will start the chain polymers and chain polymerization with starting with radical chain polymerization .   3.283810869356588
We have also seen that functionally they are very efficient catalysts in the sense that they provide a very high degree of specificity , a very high degree of turn over number as far as their function is concerned .   3.649633906819477
But the fact is that these catalysts have not found such a wide spread use as far as industry is concerned excepting in some conventional applications in foods or pharmaceuticals which are the natural processing agent in the case of industrial applications .   3.4228852212657452
They cannot be used conventionally in organic solvent .   2.704933064855726
That is the perception that means their structural confirmation in which they are catalytically active is functional only in aqueous medium .   3.18997729839332
What is immobilization ?   3.2438356642886785
If you look at for a very broad based and operational definition of immobilization we can say that enzymes are physically confined or localized in a defined region of a space .   3.172231176772837
The enzymes that are physically confined or localized in a defined region of a space with retention of their catalytic activity and which can be used repeatedly or continuously in a process are usually considered as the immobilization enzyme preparations .   2.7925080772367146
One is physically confined or localized in a defined region of space .   2.2913576729512926
That means while substrate and the product might be homogenously distributed the enzyme will be localized in some area of the space .   4.562267398735904
It will not be homogenously distributed at every point in the reaction mixture .   3.338846979010361
That means if you do any modification so as to arrive at an immobilization enzyme preparation it should require the retention of their catalytic activity .   3.49522663737642
At the end of the immobilization enzyme preparation retention of catalytic activity is a major requirement .   3.0474243039651636
Relative in the sense that hundred percent retention of catalytic activity at the end of any processing step is not feasible .   3.335571778689431
The degree of retention will vary from enzyme to enzyme ; also the more unstable the enzyme the poor will be retention or method of immobilization ; more harsher the method that means if the enzyme is subjected to more harsh treatment in terms of pH , chemicals or temperature the inactivation may be more .   3.4950871925347915
Ultimately a major portion of enzyme activity must be retained .   2.900267286782308
If the enzyme activity leads to 0 or 5 % or 10 % at the end of the immobilization I don ’ t think we should logically call it an immobilization enzyme preparation .   3.6036824045867433
The third issue and which is also operationally very important is which can be used repeatedly or continuously in a process.Ultimate objective of immobilization is to use it either repeatedly in a batch mode so that the same enzyme preparation is used in repeated batches one after another or it can be used in a continuous reactor like a plug flow reactor or a continuous stir tank reactor so that you can process some substrate over a long period of time using a same amount of enzyme and therefore decreasing the cost of enzyme per unit quantity of the product produced .   4.1674006364542295
There are number of methods .   2.4452674828882475
If you can couple an enzyme preparation to a matrix , an insoluble matrix , which is not soluble anyway couple whereas the enzyme activity is retained and this being an insoluble matrix , a particulate matrix , one can pack it into a column or one can use it in a stirred reactor and give a feed continuously and take all the product stream continuously .   4.334711916384244
Alternatively instead of coupling to a matrix it could also be feasible that you entrap the enzyme into a matrix .   3.034386466528378
For example you take a permeable micro capsule in which the enzyme molecule can be entrapped such that the enzyme molecules cannot come out but the substrate or the product can freely diffuse in and out and such a system will also be called immobilized system .   4.587868556777009
A very extreme situation can be considered of immobilization where we are not really having a physical preparation in the immobilized form but if you use a soluble enzyme in a membrane reactor , a typical membrane reactor , and this is a ultra filtration reactor in which the enzyme molecules are put in and this membrane is able to restrict the flow of enzyme and you can put in the substrate here , the product can go out and the enzyme can be retained in the membrane reactor .   4.8956873853337965
In such a case also as a system we will call as an immobilized enzyme system although the preparation will no longer be immobilized in the physical form , in the form of like what we considered as the bound preparation or entrapped preparation but still functional because in such a system you can use the enzyme continuously or repeatedly without loosing in the product stream .   3.829736971686819
So all these systems will be considered in the format of immobilized enzyme preparation and the enzyme preparation may be in the coupled form in the insoluble matrix , it could be entrapped into a semi permeable cell or entrapped in the gel because gel also provides you a porous network in which the enzyme can be entrapped and they will not be allowed to pass out through the gel pores because of the size limitation once they are entrapped and a similar thing applies to a ultra filtration reaction .   4.13395370028547
Unconventionally one can also make all these conditions feasible that means you can localize the enzyme in a defined area of space that is in an ultra filtration cell .   3.7782879762267125
That means it will allow only substances below a certain molecular weight to pass through it .   3.671203959093364
The molecules with higher molecular weight will be retained .   3.2742073238747853
This comes out of the product and the enzyme and the unconverted substrate remains in the retentate .   4.177861812954442
One limitation will be that the product has to be a low molecular product .   3.871928337109183
There are still problems .   3.6205642386197825
The cell membrane is much more specific and has quiet distinct features compared to an ordinary ultra filtration cell which only functions based on molecular weight .   3.076757880722277
The cell membrane has still more specific functions and more elaborate functions but here the function is only based on the molecular weight cut off .   3.6642693291873583
The second point is that what are the major advantages or what are the major features and why should we immobilize enzymes ?   3.8091463928452587
There are mainly two motivating factors .   2.97067893857051
I would like to give you a brief about the historical perspectives .   2.726682223864737
The whole concept of immobilization of enzymes started sometime in mid sixties and not before that mainly for two reasons .   2.8267822513167262
It has been de linked from its natural habitat and when we take an enzyme sample in a buffer , its natural structure function may not be identical as it happens in the living cell and that has been recognized very well .   4.108600545272654
If you notice the half life of an enzyme in a living cell you can make certain indirect calculations .   5.043683341582347
You can notice that in a living cell the enzyme is not as unstable as we notice it in the laboratory or pharmaceutical applications .   4.957550873645587
The turn over of the enzyme molecule itself in a living cell is quite low .   4.122347270703176
The cell does not synthesize because protein synthesis in a living cell is quite an energy intensive process and cells often will like to economise the energy consumption as far the protein synthesis is concerned .   2.690325670587424
Therefore the half life of the enzyme in the living cell , the stability is much higher compared to a free state .   5.116839012143098
Therefore they thought that coupling of an enzyme to an insoluble matrix would be a desirable feature to study enzymes or immobilized enzymes as a model system for natural enzymes and then one can really look into the various properties in terms of their operational properties , in terms of their kinetic properties and also in terms of their substrate specificity and other aspects .   4.007267049089925
In fact most of the metabolic pathways although we understand qualitatively much better but still the quantitative fluxes of the individual enzyme catalysed reactions in a metabolic pathway is still a very difficult aspect .   3.392534844349838
So the only way out left to a scientist is that one isolates and tries to mimic the conditions of a cell so that one can probably try to interpret the functioning in a cell ; how it is happening and the immobilization provided isolation of the enzyme .   3.5778127114660525
You don ’ t keep it in a cell ; you isolate but then again revert back , kind of a pseudo cell for example you entrap that into a micro capsule which is continuous semi - permeable membrane or take a very fine porous film attach an enzyme molecule to this and then this mimics as much as probably your enzyme was supported on a membrane in the living cell and study its properties .   3.798952584724145
So they were the two motivations and when we talk about the operational advantages because of our major interest we will look at enzymes as an industrial catalyst for use in industrial reactors for conversion of substrates into products .   3.673342155691776
That means the cost of the enzyme per unit product is significantly reduced by the reusability .   3.796414104032774
There is no enzyme present and the reaction is stopped .   5.022470602690606
In fact many of the products which have been commercialized using immobilized enzyme preparations are for application in food and food constituents .   3.968405554059792
In the case of immobilized enzyme that problem is not there because the enzyme is already separated and the product stream as it is can be used as a food constituent directly in the product form .   4.807135288461468
In many cases the altered optimum pH will result only on the basis of the nature of the carrier you are using .   3.5813409145915713
If it is an ionizable carrier , charged carrier then only it will lead to a change in optimum pH as we will see subsequently .   3.5751900971412436
Now let us look at the requirements of an immobilized system .   4.227689567697621
But in most cases , carrier is a candidate which is required for a coupling of soluble enzyme onto an insoluble matrix .   4.048756385419746
The third player is in method of immobilization and the total performance of immobilized enzyme preparation will depend upon the combination of the interactions between these three players .   4.2922615888809155
What are the properties we look at when we choose a soluble enzyme ?   4.031542739054864
We understand that we require a particular reaction to be catalyzed .   3.4463253294684204
So the enzyme is fixed .   6.194185393091905
High specific activity means the catalytic power of the enzyme is much high .   4.298887145002439
That means per unit weight of the protein its activity is much higher .   5.07900860267676
Purer the enzyme , the better for immobilization because you can have a very highly active immobilized enzyme preparation or the source will also be important , if you can choose a source which gives you an enzyme which has a much higher specific activity .   5.1320448485095564
Next we will consider desirable operational parameters .   2.6115646385969113
In addition to catalytic function by glucose enzyme , this process of glucose isomerisation can also take place in the presence of an alkali .   3.6241659307855407
If your environmental pH is alkaline , seven plus , the isomerisation can take place naturally and the isomerisation product will not be only fructose but it will be plus few other hexoses which will be produced and the whole advantage of using an enzymatic process is lost .   3.9860260130126095
In fact the immobilized enzyme preparation can be tailored so as to have at least minor adjustment of the operational parameters .   3.8950308147754993
In the light of specific activity , only your specific activity , again this will also depend on source of the enzyme .   3.781777806124207
The second candidate in the case of immobilized enzyme is carriers .   3.890662395799513
In terms of the total gross weight of the product for example if you look at the total immobilized enzyme preparation almost ninety nine points will be contributed by a carrier .   4.923756093111159
Bulk of the immobilization enzyme product will be in the form of carrier .   4.0879840121293665
One of the key parameter here is it has to be insoluble in reaction environment .   4.503933445417664
Therefore the carrier which we choose should be insoluble in the reaction environment and that is a major requirement .   4.674490815132457
It may ultimately depend upon the chemical composition of the carrier .   4.053831649579682
Another very important feature is resistance to microbial , thermal or mechanical degradation because as you recall right in our definition we mentioned that it is required to be used over a long period of time .   3.312916565582374
The use over a long period of time may involve many features which might expose the whole material to many features which may lead to microbial degradation , thermal degradation or mechanical degradation and the carrier should be resistant to them .   3.055841919544651
The major reason is that ultimately the objective of an immobilized enzyme system will be to have a very high activity .   3.820330734490452
The activity or the loading of the enzyme on to the carrier must be very high , the higher you can make and that will require a large number of sites for binding of the enzyme on to the carrier .   4.801740564777114
This will require many of the functional groups to be present on the carrier .   5.763407952819024
So surface area will also become quite important .   2.113249354486443
Finally if not a major scientific fact but at least the economic feature is the regenerability and cost .   2.8930341846506997
Another criterion which plays a very key role into the carrier matrix .   2.290595706043609
When I say immobilized enzyme should be used continuously or repeatedly again this means that it can be used for couple of days , couple of months , couple of years and not for ever .   3.2678883602913054
Large varieties of carriers have been used and are available for use fortunately and these carriers have been classified by various people in different modes , in different forms .   2.950211248679119
Porosity is the basis for classification of carriers .   2.3088513679169136
The non - porous carriers will have a low specific surface area because the porous matrix will provide lot of internal surface in a matrix .   3.145353756996515
The only surface which is available is the external surface , only part .   3.593986987623096
To get a higher surface area you have to reduce the particle size which also has a great limitation of use because of the smaller the particle size its use in a packed …… is difficult because of the high pressure drops .   4.885343440134372
As far as the chemical composition , ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic group or the cost is concerned it is a general feature .   4.407232136523472
Non - porous matrix also has an advantage .   2.5516878477653226
For example when you want to use an immobilized enzyme preparation for any bio - medical application it will interact with the blood stream and any external material in contact with the blood stream will generate a very vigorous immunological response and it has been noted that the non - porous matrices or the non - porous materials are much softer as far as these responses are concerned compared to porous ones .   3.5609913920591696
The typical example of the use of the non - porous matrix in the bio - medical application has been nylon as a non - porous matrix which has been used to immobilize some of the therapeutic enzymes for use in contact with the blood stream .   4.321107735992855
The third kind of material is gel structure .   2.954286571276725
Another way of classifying the carriers will be on the basis of chemical nature .   3.356315455366432
One can have either inorganic carriers or organic carriers .   2.7527170428165273
In most cases the inorganic carriers as I mentioned are the whole range of control pore glass , control pore titanium many of the clays which are naturally occurring like bentonite , animal charcoal and things like that fall under inorganic but the organic carriers are usually polysaccharides , proteins and synthetic polymers .   3.155577816022312
Typical example of organic carriers are polysaccharides , cellulose , agarose , even cross linked dextran what we call industrially as sephadex .   2.9821306065428645
This is nothing else but cross linked dextran molecules .   3.3876422219202262
And then we will begin the important discussion on polymer characterization which is basically how to determine polymer molecular weight .   3.6316445393238648
And if time permits we will continue and discuss the method of dilute solution viscometry by which we can determine viscosity average molecular weight .   4.006171800840965
So , you can imagine a equivalent sphere width which contains a polymer chain and the solvent molecules as impermeable hard sphere , and for that hard sphere we know that Einstein ’ s equation of viscosity is given by this expression where eta and eta 0 is the viscosities for the suspension and suspension medium which is basically a polymer solution and the solvating medium or the solvent .   4.068143041331093
Phi 2 is the volume fraction which is given by volume of polymer divided by total volume ; this is total volume .   4.016446762516856
Volume of polymer is given by number of polymer molecules V h ; V h is the volume of one polymer , hydrodynamic volume of one polymer coil .   3.676638781566819
It is basically the sphere which I showed in last one ; the polymer chain plus the solvent molecules which moves along with the polymer coil and you can imagine an equivalent sphere .   5.132398694634192
So , the V h is the volume of that sphere divide by total volume is the number of particle which is Avogadro number multiplied by moles of polymer V h by total volume N A .   4.144685715310873
And eta s p you know if you recollect ; eta s p is eta r minus 1 , eta by eta 0 minus 1 .   3.0461843555026054
Now what does it mean ?   1.8604044695812254
It means that intrinsic viscosity is proportional to V h by M ; V h by m is volume by mass of the polymer coil .   3.641872891943659
So denser the coil volume , the smaller the intrinsic viscosity as we have been discussing earlier that if the coil becomes more denser , then smaller is the size and smaller is the intrinsic viscosity for the same molecular weight .   3.9898398991057893
If the chain has same molecular weight but lower V h lower size for more compact coil which we can imagine for a applicable or which we will get for a branched polymer .   4.493825196202099
So , in that case intrinsic viscosity will be smaller .   3.623028226496937
Now another information this expression gives is that the term intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molecular weight is given by this which only depend up on the volume of the polymer coil in the solution .   4.516577037570586
But if you have intrinsic viscosity multiplied by the molecular weight , the intrinsic viscosity only this term the intrinsic viscosity multiplied M depends only on the hydrodynamic volume .   4.366446592374714
So , if there are two hydrodynamic chains having same hydrodynamic volume irrespective of the chemical and structural difference , the product of intrinsic viscosity and the molecule would be the same .   4.494627414553926
Now just the same information which we discussed we can compare between a branched chain and a linear chain .   3.8290467721451016
These are the yellow ones of the branched of this linear polymer ; imagine this two have same molecular weight .   2.92683026538149
If this two have same molecular weight obviously if you have branches then it will have more compact structure .   4.285677097222944
So , hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case ; hydrodynamic volume is higher in this case .   2.7509067699226875
So , intrinsic viscosity of this will be higher than the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polymer chain have the same molecular and if you divide branch by the linear , the value of the branch intrinsic viscosity of linear one you can get the extent of branching in this polymer coil .   5.036913235993304
We have not started discussion on molecular weight determination .   3.561910922887421
So , you can just ignore this title for this moment and just concentrate on the mathematical part of this expression .   3.2924718855375157
So , this was written V h ; now we are writing you can consider this as V h .   4.4675664162567
Now V h is the volume of the particle .   2.1295948875646817
So , this radius of gyration would be related proportional to the actual radius of this hydrodynamic polymer coil .   4.531384654890419
Now this r we said it is proportional to the radius of gyration .   3.4386422940279995
If you can recollect our discussion in the definition of radius of gyration , these are very close .   5.242452019838634
So , we can write that intrinsic viscosity is proportional to ; the proportionality sign is also missing here is V h which is proportional to this term divide by M .   3.670611977788349
So , we can write intrinsic viscosity is equals to this term .   4.630786459594671
So these are all h , V h expansion factor h .   3.133545354242239
So , this is the expansion factor because of the polymer solvent interaction .   6.235188992011016
Now if we recollect , this was proportional to n to the power half which is proportional to molecular into half which means three by two divide by m 3 by 2 would be some constant term because this two are proportional .   3.3610194935772575
These expressions are Flory - Fox equation and remember as we said this expansion factor is for large expansion , it was proportional to n to the power one - tenth .   3.062920387884884
So , it is approximately proportional to n into the power 10 .   3.41114814129826
So , this expression we got from the theoretical calculation which we just carried out but it was before this theoretical expression was arrived by Flory Fox , Mark and Houwink has actually arrived to this expression semiempirically by experimentally .   3.371332243048377
So , this expression is known as Mark - Houwink equation .   3.8791607298608968
This equation later we will use for determining molecular weight by dilute solution viscometry So , please remember this expression where k is constant and a is also constant .   3.639631322970449
We will learn more about k and a , and we will discuss the solution determination of molecular in solution viscometry or you can now complete that discussion .   4.8664067135608695
So , as I said that Mark - Houwink equation derived before Flory - Fox equation as a empirical equation .   2.8695479857313724
Now k and a are constant as we just discussed while deriving the expression and t s ; that is same that is constant for a given polymer solvent temperature system .   3.7133571956769558
So , this is only constant if you have same polymer and solvent temperature because if you change either of them V h , the coil dimension will change and your gyration radius of the expansion factor will also change .   4.735689180678162
Normally a lies 0.5 to 0.8 for linear chains and if your very stiff chains like rod - like , then it a can move up to 1 .   2.9636748492131852
It was for one .   2.5959892882540068
S , if this is one , then for theta conditions a value would be 0.5 .   3.466083610583874
Now a increases as the coil expansion occurs in good solvent ; in good solvent the coil expands .   2.707223032201284
Now k increases with the value of a for flexibility ; typically you have seen it has been seen that k also increases with the increase in the value of a and it is typically around this range .   5.608072666675025
Now for branched polymer , obviously , even if even you consider theta condition and put a branched polymer , then the expansion factor will be lower than the one if you compare with a linear polymer .   3.6441679161803107
So , you are a value could be lower 0.5 .   3.7828960193467744
For linear polymer it can never go down below 0.5 but if you have branched polymer it is more compact .   4.102361391535228
So , the intrinsic viscosity would be smaller as a becomes smaller .   3.9991875454871333
Now , this expression becomes little more complicated when you have copolymers , you are characterizing copolymers .   3.5522886007375987
These are the different techniques and what I have done is I have just listed the principles and some of these techniques are absolute techniques ; that means we do not require any calibration by the polymers of no molecular weight .   3.815997632345424
So , time being we are not spending much time on these techniques .   2.8494021586667366
What we will do , again this is the continuation of the list we have and we will spend significant of time on the techniques which are used very frequently in the labs like Gel Permeation Chromatography , light scattering technique , dilute solution viscometry and end group analysis and membrane osmomtery .   3.6374252259474145
These first four techniques are based on colligative property , so the principles are similar .   2.522721076187707
So , if you discuss or understand one of them , the rest will be clear to you and all this gives because colligative property is based on the number of average molecular weight .   4.011790744670824
So , this all gives number of molecular weight .   3.4460199244681218
Because we were having the discussion on Mark - Houwink equation , let us start the method or the techniques which uses dilute solution viscometry .   3.601274827267553
This intrinsic viscosity is k by M .   2.8996444133390358
Now as the technique suggest this is using the dilute solution of viscometry .   3.3007119407137813
We will just in a minute we deduce what the expression for viscosity average molecular weight .   3.830172945816785
In dilute polymer solution , we can assume the following reasonably well .   2.541294790562131
You know this assumption is reasonably okay to do is one ; the eta specific viscosity is given by the summation of the specific viscosity of the individual chains .   4.2086364252650394
Second , a specific viscosity of the individual chains can be obtained by this expression .   2.9368597789248843
Because we know that limit c tends to 0 eta sp by c is your intrinsic viscosity .   2.8568049198732153
So , this gives your concentration in terms of mass by volume .   4.267750167409453
So , we have these three assumptions and which is reasonably fair if we deal with dilute polymer solution .   3.5364570239966415
So now , we can find out the expression for the intrinsic viscosity for the polymer sample which is the mixture of all the polymer chain which is given by limit c tends to 0 eta specific by c ; eta specific is given by summation of i c .   5.362789342839523
We can write the value for c i n i M i by V and c is basically summation of c i .   3.951952643272509
So I can write , let me write in a separate page .   2.8286311075472956
n i is given by , if I can take out k outside this summation .   4.257158826920853
This is for ultimately the expression for we started from this intrinsic viscosity and we did this all the steps and finally reached here .   4.543818401078157
Now intrinsic viscosity ; if you compare this two expressions then we can write this m V is .   3.81214321598531
So , it will be equals to M w as a value lies between 0.5 to 0.8 ; M w will be M v , M v would be more than M n and less than M w .   4.3410353368237224
M v is given by as a is between 0.5 to 0.8 M v would lie M n and M w and it will be much more closer towards M w if a is higher ; if the coil expand , it will be more expansion more closer to M w and for highly stiff rods where a is 1 , M v becomes equals to M w .   4.173424600094175
So now , we know k is intrinsic viscosity is M v by a .   4.0906906619214825
Now we just got the expression for M v which is given here which is the expression for M v .   4.878375885696627
So , from here if you plot .   4.338856856275929
Then you can find , you take log eta plot with log M v ; you get log eta is log k plus a log M v .   3.287437507936966
So , what you need to find out ; if you know for experiment or if you from literature in the book , you are fine , you can get and determine experimentally the value for intrinsic viscosity and you can utilize this expression to get the viscosity average molecular weight .   4.668924405253704
But if you do not know ; somebody has done it before means for unknown sample , the unknown sample this k and a are not listed .   3.2790379329490515
So , then you do not know the M v .   3.1659066316654254
This is a calibration curve which you are getting by doing experiments of intrinsic viscosity measurement of many polymer molecular of known molecular weight .   4.089757366951279
We will come back and say it again .   3.157354597613281
If k and a are not known , what you need to do ?   2.558162531278517
You make , say , 5 solutions or 5 different molecular weight ; M 1 , M 2 , M 3 , M 4 , M5 and then measure the intrinsic viscosity for these eta 1 , eta 2 , eta 3 , eta 4 , eta 5 and then plot log of eta versus log of M and get log of k .   3.829862855531578
So if your k and a are not known , you need to have five different molecular weight of that solution where the molecular weights are known by other absolute techniques and the samples should be such that they are very narrowly dispersed .   4.790811341989911
So , that M n and M w can be equated to the M v .   3.5518457524327776
So , that is the reason it is a relative method ; it is not a absolute method .   4.206218767090932
You cannot determine M v for a unknown polymer by as such ; you need to have a calibration curve and for doing calibration curve , you need to have 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 known molecular weight narrow dispersed same polymer whose molecular weight you need to get it from the other absolute techniques like osmotic pressure or light scattering techniques .   3.9760731156561437
So , for all this case we need ; we said that will determine the intrinsic viscosity .   5.2758835851740775
For a given polymer sample in a solvent for a particular temperature how will you determine , how will you determine eta intrinsic viscosity ?   3.175594643079486
Now this k the slope depends on the molecular rate of polymer ; it is not equal for all the lengths of polymer .   6.0069177214635
So , I can put another constant k 1 and eta square because there is no constant term because this passes through the origin .   3.561316519861391
Now you can integrate this ; you integrate this , you get c is equal to eta 1 .   3.851090390165661
So , eta s p by c is written as plus k h eta square c .   2.4796259507808673
This is Huggins constant ; this is Huggins equations .   3.9301382961192703
You change any of this change .   2.6131245128750127
You change any of these three ; polymer solvent or temperature , it will vary ; the value of k H will vary .   3.708302989683729
So , now you can use this for the mixture of the polymer or interpolymer distribution so that it can be useful , because it is independent of molecular weight .   5.653708873158054
Now if the concentration is little higher , we talked about this is only applicable for eta r is less than equals to two if the concentration is higher , then this expression can be expressed like the real expression where plus other constant and so on if eta c is less than much less than one , you can ignore this terms higher term c square onwards terms , then you land up getting the Huggins expression again .   4.534443582273846
So only in case of dilute solution , you can consider only up to ; these higher terms you can neglect .   3.8570420894137425
k H have value between 0.3 for good solvent to 0.5 for poor solvent .   2.247156476024127
If this is known if k H is known , then obviously you can determine intrinsic viscosity by plotting eta s p by c versus c till the c is very dilute ; you know c should not be very high .   3.640439474621765
If you know k H , you also will know intrinsic viscosity , then you will know from the expression you can get that molecular weight .   5.14672003788088
Now alternatively we can use the inherent viscosity which can be expressed and specific viscosity is much lower than 1 .   4.437893851979278
This expression can be written eta s p minus half eta square .   3.2061855967665127
So , this Huggins equation can now be written as directly eta r is equals to c plus .   4.29567206100951
So , this gives the similar expression like the Huggins expression but this in terms of the inherent viscosity and this expression this constant is named at the person who has given this ; this is Kramer ’ s equation where K k is k H minus half .   3.9630651384080076
So , now we have two expressions Huggins equation and Kramer ’ s equation .   3.192756530888204
So , you can plot eta s p or this term inherent viscosity with respect to c and then from slope and the intercept , you can get the value of intrinsic viscosity .   4.256713193196921
So , I can plot either eta reduced which is nothing but eta s p by c or we can plot eta inherent which is ln into r by c and we will get .   3.7144361080260038
And in case of Huggins this is positive ; the slope will be positive .   4.097725901937063
So , from this you can get the value of the intrinsic viscosity .   3.4266762379432643
So in summary if we know this Mark - Houwink equation where M v expression we just have seen .   3.810248704256575
Now using either this Huggins equation or Kramer equation , you can plot either the reduced viscosity or the inherent viscosity with the concentration term to get experimentally the intrinsic viscosity .   3.127124686519298
So , this is in your hand .   3.979640818067947
You can make solutions of different concentration and you can measure viscosity of the solvent and viscosity of the solution and from viscosity of the solution and solvent you get relative viscosity and from there you get specific viscosity and from there you get reduced viscosity and inherent viscosity .   3.7725050663525264
You can get a viscometer and typically the viscosity is measured by passing using this different viscometer where the solvent and the solution is passed through the capillary where the time is proportional to the viscosity .   4.294375743076336
So , basically if you measure the time of reflux time of the solution and the solvent from the receiver , you can get the relative viscosity and from there you can get the reduced viscosity and inherent viscosity .   4.048316763701025
As you have seen if you know the k H or K k the Huggins constant or the Kramer constant k H or K k , then only from one concentration itself you can get the value of intrinsic viscosity the molecular weight .   3.5657535274358643
And if you do not know this k or a the k H or K k , then the process is to determine some or few or very narrowly dispersed same polymer and get the absolute molecular weight from any other techniques , and because it is suppose has to be very narrow dispersed polymer , you can take any of the M n or M w as equals to M v .   4.32055713592567
So with this , we conclude the discussion on determination of molecular weight by viscosity method .   3.5801051804117083
Remember whatever we are doing in this determination there are few precautions you have to take ; you have to make the solution to determine the intrinsic viscosity such that the concentrations of the solutions is very low .   4.708625269948035
So , what we will do in the next lecture we will start discussing about the other methods of determining molecular weight namely M n and M w and other polymer solvent interaction parameters .   3.3149778834544854
Based on that mechanism then the rate expression has evolved which also has characteristic features and for particular class of inhibitor .   3.56661255452206
Then one looks at the effect of inhibitor on the Michaelis Menten constant and the maximum reaction velocity of reaction .   3.571040876597034
Then another feature is the effect on the double reciprocal plot , Lineweaver - Burk plot and the nature of Lineweaver - Burk plot which is influenced as a function of inhibitor concentration will also tell you about the class of a particular inhibitor .   4.076759129357348
Any inhibition pattern is studied on these basic lines and yesterday we had looked at competitive inhibition and to summarize the nature of competitive inhibition the basic mechanistic step was that the inhibitor combines with the enzyme in a manner that prevents substrate binding .   3.4948067627670527
It may occupy the same binding site .   2.8447056168027345
It could also interfere with the binding due to steric hindrances in such a way that the binding of substrate is prevented fully or partially and substrate and the inhibitor are mutually exclusive .   3.7397391629143724
Their effect on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction is just to increase the apparent Michaelis Menten constant .   4.0109222393104
The inhibition constant that is the reversible binding of enzyme with the inhibitor and the corresponding dissociation constant is equivalent to the concentration of inhibitor that doubles the slope of initial reaction velocity that is inverse double reciprocal plot 1 / v verses 1 / S plot .   4.730004088290361
If you recall in the case of competitive inhibition we have seen that 1 / vi = Km / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) .1 / S + 1 / Vm The Michaelis Menten constant is modified by the amount 1 + I / Ki and therefore the value of Ki is equivalent to that concentration of the inhibitor at which the slope of the double reciprocal plot is double .   5.223237361185093
That means from the initial slope , the value of slope doubles and that concentration of inhibitor gives you the magnitude of Ki .   5.471026452055352
All the parameters influence the degree of inhibition at any given inhibitor concentration for the competitive inhibitor .   3.8162682019434366
The enzyme substrate inhibitor complex , the triple complex , can be arrived at either from this route or from this route because the binding of substrate and inhibitor do not interfere with each other .   3.617746855447311
They can bind reversibly , randomly and independently ; there is no interaction within them .   3.5314121365442297
It is only ES complex which will lead to product formation .   3.788470464584346
Also we assume that whether the enzyme substrate complex bind to inhibitor or the free enzyme binds to the inhibitor the dissociation constant is identical Ki .   4.06475730568726
There is no interference by binding of substrate or inhibitor onto the enzyme in their subsequent binding process .   4.175022620684935
Vm v0 = Km ( 1 + I / Ki ) + S ( 1 + I / Ki ) To simplify , to look at the effect on Km and Vm values , if we divide both the numerator and denominator by ( 1 + I / Ki ) S .   2.97379047406462
In contrast to the competitive inhibitor where the Km value was altered here the Vm value gets altered .   2.8670148319780355
It does not influence the K2 value , the turn over number , because as we know Vm = K2.E ’ 0 Here E0 , in the presence of non - competitive inhibitor , corresponds to that fraction of total enzyme which is in the form of ES .   4.013218829322476
The ESI complex form is functionally inactive and therefore the K2 is not altered .   3.1788404350653403
E0 is a fixed quantity when there is no inhibitor in the reaction .   3.8899429743409164
In many cases the binding of substrate can influence the catalytic function on the substrate binding .   4.332928835184067
Binding wise it may be independent .   2.340930711728827
There are two parts in the active site .   2.986497135785653
One is the binding process which is not influenced which is elaborated by our dissociation constant .   3.672185482803367
The binding part of the active site is demonstrated by the dissociation constant .   3.7024022178299227
Turn over number is unaffected here .   2.27511913653461
In the case of the non - competitive inhibition , the turn over number will be unaffected as far as the kinetic parameter is concerned .   3.371648575388665
But it can influence the catalytic capacity of the enzyme molecule in total .   4.548159834758712
But when I say K2 , I am referring K2 in the sense of the original catalytic function which was present , which is retained and only in the presence of a bound inhibitor on the inhibitor binding site , the catalytic function is lost .   4.430890203400917
In this category of reversible inhibitors the inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme substrate complex .   3.1384154428559206
It doesn ’ t have any mechanism to recognize the free enzyme .   2.7645755094581577
km k2 E + S ES E + P + I ki ESI ES can bind to inhibitor giving you ESI .   2.417104244064971
The inhibitor can bind to only to the ES complex and does not bind to the free enzyme .   3.3777354453755772
Very few cases , almost rare cases are there where one notices this kind of un - competitive inhibition .   2.5108503306963255
So there is a sequence of binding .   3.9612223859758062
When we look at bisubstrate reactions we notice that this inhibition pattern gives you lot of information about the sequence of binding of the substrate in the case of a bisubstrate reaction .   3.5186553976703143
Vm v = Km + S ( 1 + I / Ki ) To bring it to the same format of Michaelis Menten equation , if you can divide both numerator and denominator by ( 1 + I / Ki ) S .   3.382983503348597
The slope remains unaltered but the intercept is increased .   2.5123976212320875
This is your intercept and the intercept 1 / Vm on the y axis is increased by a factor of ( 1 + I / Ki ) .   3.9094686079893193
If you make a secondary plot of 1 / Km ’ verses I , 1 / Km ’ = 1 / Km + I / Km.Ki you will get the value of Ki .   3.719643104462168
In all these cases by following a typical pattern that is by understanding the reaction mechanism , the binding of the inhibitor and substrate to the enzyme and their interaction between each other one can really arrive at a rate expression .   3.814538443656452
One can also look at the double reciprocal equation , Lineweaver Burk equation , make a double reciprocal plot , see the nature of double reciprocal plot and identify the nature of inhibitor which we are talking about by understanding these .   4.495179697937045
Such a situation can be considered something away from the ideality , a kind of mixed type of inhibition .   3.5271947561563506
One of the most commonly observed mixed type of inhibition is what we call as linear mixed type inhibition .   3.178698852101656
In that case we assumed , one basic factor , that the dissociation constant for binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme and the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme substrate complex is identical .   3.782552974267523
But in many cases this may not be so .   3.7351840592031973
In such a case ES going to E plus P .   2.1482975479037996
If the inhibition constant for this is Km and if the system has to come to equilibrium , then the equilibrium constant for reaching ESI from either side must be identical and this inhibitor constant will also become a Km .   4.357682004301151
km E + S ES E + P + + I I ki aki akm EI + S ESI In most cases it so happens that the inhibition constant for binding of inhibitor to the free enzyme or binding of inhibitor to the enzyme substrate complex are not identical as assumed in the non - competitive inhibition and therefore the presence of inhibitor on the enzyme changes Km also by the same factor a Km and in such cases the rate expression becomes modified .   4.123140439022985
Vm . S vi = Km / ( 1 + I / Ki ) + S ( 1 + I / a Ki ) Km ( 1 + I / Ki ) ( 1 + I / a Ki ) 1 / vi = .   2.756442097404463
+ Vm S Vm For cases where a &gt ; 1 you will get a profile in which the double reciprocal plot of 1 / S Vs 1 / v at different inhibitor concentrations will intersect at a point on the left hand side of the y - axis .   3.2365142496890633
If you consider the slopes and the intercepts of this plot , a replot of the slope will give you Ki .   3.870137914612772
That means magnitude by which the dissociation constant of binding of inhibitor is modified can be determined .   5.2046062703780755
Such profiles are indicative of modification of dissociation constant as a function of substrate binding in the presence of non - competitive inhibitors .   3.3004519986206904
Such cases are very commonly found and in most of the practical cases they are not usually ideal type of inhibition patterns .   4.355770127025297
That means the extent by which the rate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction is reduced by the inhibitor can be reduced by increasing the substrate concentration in relation to inhibitor concentration .   5.436386724452385
In the case of non - competitive inhibition whatever be the concentration of substrate , it does not influence the degree of inhibition and it is totally dependent on the concentration of inhibitor and the Ki .   4.669168355562178
In the case of un - competitive inhibitor the degree of inhibition is S.I / Ki ( Km + S ) .   3.2901035528796156
Because the binding sides are different and they don ’ t interfere with each other but in the case of mixed inhibition , the magnitude of inhibition will be dependent on the ratio of dissociation constant for free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex with the inhibitor .   4.486332925865805
a will determine the magnitude of the degree of inhibition .   2.9235847490601605
The inhibition patterns obtained for bisubstrate reactions gives you lot of information about the binding pattern of different substrate or the sequence of binding of the different substrate in the case of a multisubstrate reaction .   4.06813476805185
It reaches a limiting value of 1 + I / Ki .   2.3005942716552785
But otherwise at low substrate concentration that will be some where in between zero and that value .   3.6771518382719863
Another way is to look at the inhibition pattern in a generalized way rather than specific cases .   2.836847203521348
In the three different cases that we talked about for the type of inhibition , in the case of competitive inhibition magnitude of KESI will tend to infinity .   5.316511641376368
That means these two dissociation constants are identical .   3.159957646228883
In the case of mixed inhibition they are different by a factor a and in the case of un - competitive inhibition the magnitude of KEI is infinity or rather tends to infinity .   3.8328160023945017
In the competitive inhibitor the binding of the inhibitor to ES complex is not feasible and the dissociation constant is infinity .   4.524488728883781
In the case of non - competitive inhibition it can bind to either E or ES and the dissociation constant is identical .   3.2947748362081257
That means binding to free inhibitor is not feasible .   3.479723604745602
In this fourteenth lecture I plan to you know continue the discussion we had on the thermodynamics of radical polymerization , which is valid for other chain growth polymerizations as well .   3.7884382093120776
We talk about the molecular weight distribution and we will talk about different processes , different polymerization processes for radical polymerization .   3.74258072858336
Now , you also remember in R p term there was plus half E d term on the numerator and in case of X n there was minus half E d term in the activation energy .   3.6116695752171597
Thermo , thermal process because E d is highest it was getting effected by the temperature rise .   2.501518525637267
The increase in the rate of polymerization was much higher in case of polymerization initiated by a thermal initiator , then redox initiator and then photo chemical initiator .   4.19738841109872
In case of photochemical reaction it actually gets slight increase in molecular weight with increase in temperature .   3.0720662313505227
And we were talking about the T c ceiling temperature and the equilibrium concentration of free monomer and we got this two expression .   4.725861572498481
Typically we do reaction polymerization reaction as well in a isothermal condition you know .   3.270125696154491
The equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration at that temperature determined by this value , del H p and del S p .   3.2203375127179448
So , that reaction at the temperature will continue till the free monomer concentration reach to the equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration related to that temperature .   4.010839344354508
If you do a higher reaction at higher temperature then equilibrium concentration comes goes up that means your polymerization reaction stop at a higher free monomer concentration .   4.232137850465144
And if you keep on increasing the temperature , one temperature will come where that equilibrium concentration is equals to the free monomer concentration your know pure pure monomer concentration .   3.754947169313111
That means you can never polymerize at that temperature or beyond that temperature , which is 61 degree for methyl alpha methyl styrene we just talked about .   4.124199111349641
So , at 61 degree or beyond 61 degree you cannot at all polymerize alpha methyl styrene .   2.6910386043967547
As we can see that the T c value depends or the relation between T c and M e depends on the values of del H and del S p .   3.277886685526529
As I discussed at the last part of my lecture last lecture that delta is between polymer and monomer is basically change in entropy due to the translation motion vibration or rotational entropies and the rotational and vibration entropies of the monomer lost due to polymerization is actually gained in polymer .   3.810920197777527
So , you will see that del S value is more or less more or less same for most of the monomers .   4.068996046172999
But del H value will change as we were discussing in last lecture and that will depend upon the amount of stabilization which could be due to resonance or inductive effective or by hyper conservation or by the inter monomer complexes .   3.838074983919521
If more stabilization means lower value of del H which means lower value of T c and the higher the strain , that means higher is the energy of the polymer again the lower is the magnitude of the del H value .   4.418422132953018
Now , let us consider or let us compare few monomers and their del S .   3.399917133719461
Where in case of del S a one molar solution , it could be either of this two , you have to pure monomer is converted into pure polymer which is either completely crystalline or slightly amorphous , del S you can also consider from pure to pure or a one molar solution of the monomer to a one molar solution of the polymer repeat unit .   4.426929781328517
Now , this context you can appreciate that del H value does not depend on the concentration of the monomer whereas , del S value does depend .   4.130486439212549
del S value is dependent on the concentration of the monomer .   2.974658991571381
Now , this value is quite high .   4.07473263607446
This will be higher from any other because he was talking about this is a gas phase reaction .   4.347693698708469
So , obviously drop in entropy will be much higher , these are negative numbers .   3.3789435354684954
Sorry , so this will be much higher .   2.7310709591311046
When you talk about the solution phase then this values will be similar .   3.906248121593031
Now , you can see that this del H more or less same .   2.9338459224900455
Now , let us compare between first styrene and alpha methyl styrene .   2.6039394591088745
Now , that is because this polymer made from this one one substituted alkynes are going to generate when this five one this s p 2 is converted to s p 3 they are going to give lot of strain .   4.0252504563446765
If this alpha methyl styrene is converted to a polymer obviously because of this presence of this groups the polymer will be much more strained compared to the monomer which is a planer molecules .   5.067253939919195
There is no strain of these groups .   3.6873220203155426
So , this happens for most of the one one substituted alkynes .   4.5676979118579935
The monomer stabilization is more or same between styrene and alpha methyl styrene .   2.7410774635353077
The magnitude of del H comes down .   2.5430111929651638
So , a polymer resulting from M M A will be much more strained compared to a polymer from just methyl acrylate .   3.8273545758611665
If you compare between say propyne and acrylonitrile propyne and acrylonitrile , so if you C H 3 and C N .   4.0126237820457415
Obviously resulting polymers which have similar strain .   2.532286774326875
So , it determine the del H value determined by the stabilization of the this double bond .   4.427426069218498
So , that value of acrylonitrile polymerization will be lower , so that 76 compared to 84 .   4.777072851092239
And as decrease in the value of del H which means thermodynamic feasibility will also comes down .   3.437985858725686
We can compare between say one butyne and one tribu butyne .   3.0647465511153853
So , it will have much lower del H value .   4.449454355244236
If you if you compare between the acrylic acid and say acrylonitrile and acrylic acid .   4.075570921230092
If its compared polymers this groups cannot line up to form hydrogen bonding .   2.398672515984792
So , the hydrogen bonding in acrylic acid polymer is much lower compared to acrylic acid monomer , which means del H value will be lower for acrylic acid compared to say acrylonitrile .   4.02124355206248
Now , the values for tetrafluoroethylene is very high extremely high del H value which is is very difficult to is actually 163 , trifluoroethylene is 163 .   4.715477669223831
Now , that is very high , it is very difficult to explain .   4.4169484259302925
It could be due to that resulting polymers have because because have a strong association .   3.0888996200075187
And in this case that might go down with could results in the increase in the magnetitude of the del H that is one way to explain the high value of del H of high value of magnetitude of del H in case of trifluoroethylene to poly tetrafluoroethylene tetrafluoroethylene to poly tetrafluoroethylene .   4.400528554197293
Now , this value of del H is also important because that dictate you the exothermicity of the reactions .   4.1524484996598945
And if you have some knowledge about the exothermicity then you can actually control your , you can take out the the heat generated .   4.342251724463688
If the heat is , you cannot effectively remove the heat which is getting generated by this exothermic polymer reaction then it will accumulate and it will increase the temperature local temperature .   4.291950728814767
It will increase the reaction rate and decrease the molecular weight in a uncontrolled way .   4.296230540494169
Of course , if you go back and see this one if this is low for a given M e , this will be lower because this more or less same .   4.463257239937819
Whereas , molecule like styrene can be easily polymerized to a very low equilibrium value of free monomer in the mixture .   3.965611428731948
Now , we have talked about that one one substituted disubstituted monomers also difficult to polymerize .   3.447692554673113
Now , this this monomers have quite significant value of del H , for say for maleic anhydride this is about minus 59 kilojoule per mole , which means it is not the the fact maleic anhydride is very difficult to polymerize .   3.4913557107658764
This is the radical is get generated this is the propagating radical .   5.519458374811263
Now , that approach becomes very sterically hindered because of presence of all this one one substitution .   3.4683895221207695
And that is the reason this is very difficult and and that is why this reactions are very difficult to carry out .   5.03053514531497
The R p and X n the molecular weight can be also dependent on the pressure as well , though it is not that significant as temperature .   4.5383126155927105
If the volume is lower in transition state then del V will be negative .   3.6373363066223834
If this is positive then rate of polymerization will go up with temperature and if its negative if it is negative then it will go down .   4.187340254697682
And it seldom practice the in the increase in rate of polymerization can be achieved much easily then by increasing the temperature than increasing the pressure .   4.443141487904557
When you increased your temperature as much as possible even if you do not get a appreciable polymerization rate then people actually increase the polymerization increase the pressure to get a higher polymerization rate .   3.981427620476532
If you recollect the value for say your X n say this is your average degrees of polymerization for a thermal initiated polymerization .   4.352404193314452
The monomer consistent drops as well as the initiator concentration drop .   3.3116596760009895
But the drop in initiator concentration is much more compared to drop in monomer concentration .   3.1754874165482465
That means the molecular weight is more compared to the molecular weights which were getting generated before .   5.646142423376611
So , at if you consider these expressions with time goes molecular concentration the monomer drops so as the concentration of the initiator .   4.459446884197231
So , which means that the molecular distribution if you consider the entire reaction is very complicated because at any instantaneous time the the molecular weight is different .   4.832578410698693
If you talk about the molecular at the beginning of the reaction , that is quite different than the molecular weight of the polymers which are at the end of the reaction .   4.3986174210687325
That in case , of step growth polymerization step growth polymerization the polymer is considered the entire mass .   4.106091805062722
You start with a monomer you complete the polymerization reaction .   2.590368064693272
So , how did we get that X n bar remember X n bar was the number of molecules at t is equal to 0 and number of by divided by molecules at end of the polymerization .   3.7606711990724384
But in case if you getting a P D I value is one point less than 2 for a polymers which you have taken out from the solution which means that the low molecular samples which might have left in the solution .   4.498873588187268
So , that is the fundamental difference between X n in case of radical polymerization and in X n in case of step growth polymerization .   3.734820903087539
Now , in in case of step growth polymers X n is considered at the end of the reaction .   4.098004964694908
Where in case of radical polymerization X n varies each time the dead polymer chains are forming .   3.2149960545230862
So , X n will vary with the time .   2.680242509564785
Say , at low conversion that means at the beginning of the reaction low conversion X n bar is given by 1 by 1 minus P X w n given by 1 plus P 1 minus P and X w bar X n bar P D I given by 1 plus p .   4.045882848987296
Now , these are for for case if one polymer is formed from one kinetic chain which means termination by disproportionation or by transfer this is apply to this .   3.404858023092251
P is not the conversion unlike step growth P is not a conversion here .   4.231340208390496
P is a probability that a propagating radical will continue to propagate that means continue to react with monomer .   3.429441988318706
It should be given by the ratio of rate of propagation with rate of propagation plus rate of termination plus rate of transfer .   5.9910716414191505
So , a radical a kinetic chain or a propagating radical can undergo three reaction it can again reactive with the monomer and propagate , it can terminate , it can transfer .   3.9211557104667882
Now , in case for high polymers for high molecular weight polymers high molecular weight polymers again the probability is always the probability of propagation is higher because that is why it is propagating P also tends to 1 .   4.205014675132342
Now , if for for a polymer getting for polymers getting terminated by combination that means one polymer is getting formed from two kinetic chain .   3.9384370959531663
Obviously , the distribution will be the narrower and the molecular weight will be higher .   4.420054145208929
So , this these are remember this at low conversion we are talking about reaction has just started .   4.482535162122841
Reaction has not progressed too much so the concentration of monomer and concentration of initiator has not changed much .   2.798963307208877
So , the molecular weight , the average number of degrees of polymerization the weight average degrees of polymerization and the P D I is given by this expressions .   5.00968459376139
I am not going in detail in derivation of this process is complicated process .   2.799964229168023
Whereas , P is given the probability of the propagation radical will continue to propagate and build polymer which is R p divided R p plus R t and are transfer , where if the polymer is terminated by combination reaction than this gives by this .   3.8318657333679145
So , the P D I value will be between this is 1.5 to the case where we have termination by this propagation of transfer this 2 .   4.804092755571486
So , this is expected that at low conversion the polydispersity will between 1.5 to 2 .   3.760643079290169
Now if the reaction continues the , this value changes and is actually it is become higher because the drop in as I said drop in initiator concentration is much faster compared to drop in monomer concentration .   3.8547169837752375
So , if you consider the total polymerization so obliviously , the broadness will be much higher .   3.3665179885590906
The reaction , the polymers made at the begin will be lower molecular weight comparatively lower molecular weight .   4.058290715398351
If there are gel effect then what happen you know that branching might happened and if branching happen between or the which results from chain transfer two polymer .   3.443699218026339
For inter intra polymer chain transfer there is no change in molecular weight or molecular weight distribution either .   3.5038534410938253
Basically , these are not the polymers you want you want polymers which are as narrower as possible .   4.099793298675484
So , that is why you would like to avoid this gel effect and and branching and and so on .   3.4920214111663257
So , that you can get narrower and this is the most typical values of P D I you get from a normal polymerization radical polymerization reaction .   4.656342348897036
Now , what , I will talk about that we talked about the effect of temperature , thermodynamics of polymer , different molecular weight distribution .   4.8328168760412105
We talked about all the theory and principle behind molecular weights rates and all this .   3.185541384281788
Now , the practical part how the monomers are usually polymerized in a in a industry scenario or in the lab .   4.129484163739139
There could be several processes .   2.411325553313815
You can disperse the monomers in aqueous phase and do the polymerization , you call this suspension polymerization .   4.680554973308648
You can do it in a disperse dispersed resulting polymer the produced polymer could be dispersed in organic solvent and you can continue the polymerization as the polymers remain in disperse .   4.065382328632343
We call that as a dispersion polymerization .   2.520908969832331
We talk about of each of this brief .   3.656276729923621
We will spend most time on emulsion polymerization and so let us start about the bulk polymerization .   4.637121251812882
Advantage is that we have seen that the reaction polymer polymer reaction rate as well as the molecular weight goes up with increase in monomer concentration , which is not true for increasing initiator concentration for initiator increase in initiator concentration rate goes up , but the molecular weight comes down .   4.914543863342227
You can get maximum concentration monomer if you do in a pure state , so monomer concentration is high .   4.669924150590114
And that can be applied in optical applications like C D E and you know other things where you require very clean polymers .   3.56540072497698
Obviously , this has lot of disadvantages .   2.4399852959703705
And as a result what happened , you there is a local heat generation which actually can degrade your polymers which actually can degrade the polymer molecules and can generate coloration in your polymers .   3.859044294266644
As I know as we know that high monomer gives high reaction rate .   4.24626712265384
So , heat generation is high rate and as a result local heat formation takes place coloration and degradation takes place .   3.006445128134005
So , what is done it is still done ?   3.319998289856796
Typically , what is done you start the reaction and keep it at low conversion so that build up is not too high not unmanageable .   3.7842073447116946
You make a p polymer so the viscosity is not high and then that pre - polymer is poured into a mold in this case sheet .   3.8170279754360203
And then you you want to get the polymer in a final form of a sheet .   6.029128510006798
So , the reaction rate will be faster and high molecular weight produced and it will you do not need to process it .   5.075071034393373
It will , it will become like a sheet .   3.9888561080489735
You are taking this pre - polymer putting in a sheet type mold and then finishing the polymerization .   2.638123006153911
You actually , gel effect is a beneficial for this thing .   2.4349768736158652
So , that you can make a high molecular weight and reaction get faster and you get the final formed final polymer in terms of a sheet .   5.110611962332717
In this case , you require initiator to be in the solvent and free radical kinetic normal can be applied .   4.587939717995101
So , sometimes this this polymerization is called powder or granular polymerization .   2.4643049771686476
In this case , you do not have those problems because you are doing in a solution then heat heat transfer can takes place efficiently because it is solution viscosity does not build up .   3.90450791505219
Now , what is disadvantage obviously you are doing a solutions of monomer concentration goes down which means rate of polymerization becomes lower and molecular weight becomes lower .   4.495754555744345
And unless if you do not choose the solvent very carefully the solvent can participate in chain transfer reaction , reduce your molecular weight further , so you have to be very careful .   4.133464311842238
Now of course , sometimes is very difficult to remove the solvent quantitatively from the polymer no matter how much vacuum you applied it is very difficult some times because solvents stick to the polymer .   3.5980510584168637
We are talking about organic solvent , so it is not very environmental friendly and the person scientist finally either .   3.796583631589373
You know we not want somebody working in the lab with the huge amount of organic solvent that is health hazardous well as the environmental hazardous .   3.5231152520674955
These are the disadvantage for a solution polymerization , but still use for making polyethylene poly acrylonitrile or polyethylene acetate .   3.2363918846105606
So , heat dispersion heat dissipation is easy , viscosity is does not build up its not a problem .   2.6945778642799847
Once , you start this monomers containing the initiator will form droplets .   2.757077897118333
And it will remain dispersed because you have added in that reaction medium and dispersions which are typically water soluble polymers like polyethylene glycol or some inorganic particles which actually get absorbed on this particles and prevent them to coulis .   3.7033823194630417
And because you are continually stirring this actually stabilized the suspension , so the poly .   2.809992045126471
Now , you are doing the bulk polymerization in the small droplets .   5.470532338457936
So , all the advantages of bulk polymerization is remain still intact high polymerization rate , high molecular weight , very pure monomers .   3.2608406754359907
And once the polymerization is complete you can just filter out and get the final polymers in a beads form .   3.626032994942328
Now , these beads should not stick which other .   2.4926366728756544
The temperature you are taking out if your glass transition temperature your polymer is close to that room temperature or little higher than the polymer will be soft .   4.90254373643394
And if the polymers are soft then they will stick to each other .   3.4927572751017157
So , this methods is typically applied for the polymers which have the high glass transition temperature like methyl methacrylate and all this things .   5.16039146639639
In fact some of the unusual reactor configurations which have been proposed to catalyze to be used for carrying out enzyme catalyzed reaction like hollow fiber reactors also arbitrarily fall into one of those categories of plug flow or CSTR which were discussed .   3.882447481929
That means the factors that are dictated by the immobilization enzyme preparation itself .   3.8997584529909948
For example form of the enzyme ; the nature of the substrate is also fixed .   6.0346433183490715
Once the enzymatic reaction is defined the nature of substrate is fixed .   4.565306175186366
The carrier loading capacity also depends on the bulk density of the immobilized enzyme preparation and things like that .   3.2547910480531104
But the two important class of factors which I wanted to point out here is one is reaction kinetics and mass transfer characteristics .   3.509842478188971
They are the ones which very heavily dictate the choice of the reactor ; whether to go for a plug flow reactor or to go for a batch reactor or to go for a continuous stirred tank reactor are very heavily dictated by mass transfer requirements and reaction kinetics .   3.443060011010904
I would once again point out that we have knowingly ignored heat transfer requirements assuming that for most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction the rate of reaction is very , very small and so heat transfer during the reaction is not a major critical factor .   4.2396727256763125
In certain cases if it is so , the heat transfer characteristics also must be taken into account .   2.992967657454946
That means for design of a particular type of reactor what kind of design parameters are important and you will recall that we had also hypothesized certain conditions or assumptions which define an idealized enzyme reactor system and the assumptions were that isothermal operation , ?   3.655039762947772
H is very small , uniform enzyme distribution , plug flow behavior or completely back mix behavior , that means you have one of the extreme fluid dynamics in the reactor system .   3.893220962564487
These are the basic assumptions which define our ideal enzyme reactor and the reactor design parameters .   3.958268355704204
Then the temperature of operation , pH control and these are the reaction conditions .   3.9512529915737526
Other design parameters are fractional conversion and productivity and reactor capacity .   2.351329674278935
That is the maximum reaction capacity assuming that the enzyme reaction follows a maximum reaction velocity , that is zero order profile and the productivity of that kind of the reactor will be your reaction capacity .   4.848594736681931
If we consider …. .. enzyme reactor we can safely say that Michaelis Menten kinetics provides us a basis for carrying out a universally accepted kinetics for enzyme catalyzed reactions and so therefore we will assume in most cases v is equal to v = k2E0S / Km + S Wherever we are talking of immobilized enzyme we must also clearly understand that these two terms k2 and Km are denoted by prime indicating only that they are immobilized enzyme parameters and not the soluble parameters .   4.183780434882
A typical profile ; it can change from reaction to reaction .   2.5405410062544007
If the reaction is very strongly inhibited by products or strongly inhibited by substrates the profile might undergo a change .   3.1932467358714716
One of the probably very general features of analyzing the reactor performance as you may be aware is material balance across the reactor .   3.4978265455001494
In the case of a batch reactor the reactor performance can be just simplified integrated form of the reaction equation and that is - ds / dt = k2.E0 Km / S + 1 Typical Michaelis Menten equation .   4.531325770145757
Even when we write integrated form of equation we can assume that this is also valid if you make a material balance across the batch reactor because the classical material balance equation requires that input minus output minus conversion should be equal to accumulation .   3.788491009547012
There is no continuous output or input in the system and the conversion is given by the rate of reaction .   4.459195973859984
So v into rate of reaction is the total accumulation and the conversion factor and by canceling the volume term from both the sides you can arrive at the integrated form of the equation and this equation if you integrate , it will lead to the reactor performance equation .   4.072681682791096
If you just simplify it , you will get Km ln S0 / S + S0 - S = k2.E0.t Again I like to repeat that in case if we are using a batch reactor for immobilized enzymes we should replace Km and k2 by prime terms .   4.491674866286101
This will be equal to P = S0 - S = XS0 Therefore you can also write in terms of product concentration KmlnS0 / S0 + P = k ’ 2E0t If you look at these equations you can use the reactor performance data of a batch reactor .   5.164104822875932
You can write down the expression ln S0 / S 1 k ’ 2E0t + = S0 - S Km K ’ m ( S0 - S ) From the equation two if you just simplify you get a straight line equation which can give the values of Km and vm .   4.4066135028876285
This provides you one of the simple methods .   3.7023001556922552
Monitor the substrate concentration or fraction of conversion with reference to time and determine the parameters by a single reactor performance data .   3.985571773559792
That provides us a simple tool , batch reactor for small scale laboratory experiments to determine the kinetic parameters both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme .   3.7467021202698887
Whereas when we integrate the equation from zero to time t let us say to a conversion factor of 90 % or 95 % or 99 % , the reaction rate is not likely to remain the same as that of the initial time .   3.7767344934396405
But still it gives you a very approximate situation for designing a reactor or making some design calculations to work out reactor size or the capacity of the reactor , accepting that and even compare between soluble enzyme and immobilized enzyme but otherwise under idealistic conditions , the assumptions in the Michaelis Menten equation that of the initial reaction rate , absence of product division is not met here .   3.5267832592724506
That means either when the substrate concentration is much , much smaller than Km or when it is much higher than Km .   3.744950590821365
How the reactor performance will change ?   3.8350778088349506
For example when substrate concentration is much , much smaller than K ’ m , reactor performance becomes - K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0t When S0 is much , much greater than K ’ m that is zero order regime .   3.257235491546881
But analytical solutions may be difficult .   1.92736857799025
We make an assumption depending upon the range in which our substrate concentration exists in relation to Km value .   2.9701950028382655
If the Km to S0 ratio increases and you assume a first order kinetics error will keep on increasing .   3.3382902576777753
In fact one can make a hypothetical computation and then we take up an assignment to design an enzyme reactor or for that matter any process equipment .   4.073980321052557
A 10 % error in calculation is usually taken for granted .   1.878994088445986
You will add on to that about 10 % open added space or for various purposes .   3.0725928312253963
The next simple form of reactor system which is commonly employed is a continuous stirred tank reactor .   3.1832180852042997
In the continuous stirred tank reactor one is a continuous flow reactor .   4.366453911712974
So if the feed is added at the flow rate of “F ” let us say litres or moles per unit time , what ever unit you follow , the volume remains the constant .   4.081042272590819
Consider that after a certain period of time the reactor comes under steady state situation .   3.121066410019216
Under that condition the accumulation term will tend to be zero because whatever material is coming in , either it is getting converted to do reaction or it is going out of the reactor .   3.685647740492688
That is your space time that was defined in the earlier expressions .   4.51917531028695
Solving these equations you can also get k ’ 2E0 ?   3.141658051121035
= S0X + K ’ m ( X / 1 - X ) That gives you a reactor performance for a CSTR and from the substrate concentration if you make a substitution for X , you arrive at detector performance for CSTR .   4.286349750354582
. Second expression is ?   1.5891841995856069
= XS0 / k ’ 2E0 .   1.595271870250934
So you get the two expressions for CSTR the general reactor performance expression and also under conditions of zero order and first order scenario .   3.7230591892329223
The other idealized reactor or which is what we understand as the plug flow is slightly typical in the sense that unlike in the case of a CSTR , the concentration of the substrate or the product vary along the length of the reactor .   3.8533756145665374
It varies ; that means if you consider along the length of the reactor , kind of a batch reactor with different reaction times but to arrive at the reactor performance what we can do is we can make a material balance across a differential element of the plug flow reactor and if we consider differential element of volume d v you can make your material balance say under same conditions like the feed flow rate as “F ” , the conversion changes from X to X + ?   4.2377387707337615
X at the inlet X is equal to zero at the outlet X has some value .   3.0576836432904724
F.S = F ( S + dS ) + ( - v ) .dV One can simplify it to get F.dS = v.dV Here for the fraction of conversion X = S0 - S / S0 ; dS = - S0dX F.S0.dX = - v.dV You can integrate this and the integrated form will give you the zero to v dv / FS0 which will be equal to zero to X dX / - v or V / FS0 because feed rate is constant , substrate concentration is constant and so the definite integral will come to V / FS0 and that is ?   3.8740903492261487
Epsilon , while in the case of a stirred bed reactor , is taken to be one .   2.956183872487844
A very small fraction of the total volume is occupied by the enzyme preparation .   4.7900461454194465
This tau term has been defined earlier as V / F ; in the case of a packed bed reactor we define tau as eV / F .   2.7908355082867207
That is for CSTR or for a stirred batch reactor the magnitude of epsilon is one .   4.495339065052528
The same analysis as we did earlier if you consider for zero order kinetics the tau is equal to ?   4.218200570086595
= - K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) / k ’ 2E0e A very important feature which I like to recall is the relative performance equations for zero order regime for both CSTR as well as for PFR , which are identical .   3.611496723015063
If you look at the equation number two here for the CSTR and the equation for the zero order regime here in the case of the PFR , they are identical .   4.0653559183018855
That means the fluid dynamics in the reactor whether it is a back mix system or its a plug flow system does not influence the reactor performance as long as the reaction is in the zero order regime or the concentration of the substrate is much , much higher than the Km value and you must appreciate that if it is in our limits we will always like to use a very high substrate concentration .   4.928360094092326
There are two things one will always like to have a high substrate concentration for a reaction ; for commercial purposes also we like to have a very high fraction of conversion and one would like to carry out the reaction almost to conversion levels of ninety five percent plus so as to achieve a complete conversion of substrate as much as possible so that the recovery and the purification stages are simplified or the product stream can be used as it is for end applications .   4.31763312869662
Consider a first order regime where K ’ m is much , much greater than S0 .   3.6841245956163537
In the case of CSTR , you have the reactor performance as K ’ m ( X / 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 ?   4.447552667194692
That means the quantity of the enzyme required will be identical in both cases for carrying out the same conversion and at the same enzyme loading .   4.92666200216858
But if you consider the first order regime the performance are quite different and if you compare the relative performance , relative quantity of the enzyme required that is ECSTR , the quantity of enzyme required in CSTR and PFR relative quantities or we can define this term as Erel will be equal to ECSTR / EPFR = Erel = - X e / ( 1 - X ) ln ( 1 - X ) The relative quantity of enzyme required in the case of CSTR and PFR under first order regime can be given by this expression .   3.7726042540850497
You can just hypothetically put some values of let us say a safe value for epsilon for a typical packed bed reactor varies from between 0.4 to0.5 .   3.423541156637771
The inference I want to arrive at is that higher the fractional conversion required for a particular reaction under first order regime , the relative quantity of the enzyme required in the CSTR will drastically increase .   4.089694968962801
That means even for certain reasons if you want to use CSTR pH control is a requirement and we are obliged to use CSTR , then it is always advisable only to use if the fraction of conversion required is not very high .   4.215807727917917
You can have facility for pH control with some inconvenience ; may be some more additional equipments has to be added but still that will be better because the quantity of the enzyme required will be much less and that gives us a significant advantage for using immobilized enzyme in PFR and that is one of the reasons why you will notice in the literature that almost about 70 - 80 % of the total reports which appear on the use of the immobilized enzymes are in a plug flow reactors and the advantage lies in the quantity of the enzyme required and this advantage will keep on reducing .   4.436945002533843
That is the relative quantity will keep on reducing if the shift is from first order to zero order ultimately it will reach to same quantity .   3.780463730543135
If we take the value of Km / S0 from a very high value to a very low value , the relative quantity of the enzyme will also keep on reducing and it will become equal to the relative enzyme value , Erel and will become one .   5.046964328089284
Then the value of S0 is much , much higher than Km .   3.884051696955022
A typical profile for relative quantity required is shown here .   2.5661681096751034
There are two things to be looked at .   2.8899055593351295
One is the relative quantity of substrate to Km .   3.847654589642807
The top profile , the first profile indicates a very low value of S0 / Km which means a first order regime .   3.3100715064604844
The increase in the quantity of the enzyme required is not very large in the low fractional conversion levels whereas as soon as you cross 0.90 % conversion , the quantity required becomes significantly high .   3.762294651847697
One can have such a profile and when one wants to analyze the reactor performance for any given immobilized enzyme system , one must really characterize a system with reference to such kind of profiles so that one can get a feel of the substrate concentration required and the fractional conversion required , one can choose where to bank upon .   3.8375688135233825
For example in the earlier phases let us say up to 90 % , there is no major gain in using PFR .   4.394377884520508
For example if the pH control is required CSTR is preferable and then the nature of the substrate , the nature of the enzyme and the form of the enzyme .   5.350682548158696
If suppose your substrate is colloidal , we will prefer to use CSTR rather than the PFR ; it will choke .   3.1252375335780327
The pressure drop will continuously keep on increasing .   2.1762229391450982
So far we have not considered the inhibition patterns .   2.291534783886375
We have not considered the behaviour of the reactor performance if the enzyme undergoes inhibition kinetics .   4.015929785006643
So far we have been talking assuming that the enzyme reactors are ideal in performance and they are following Michaelis Menten type of kinetics .   3.4334026605985164
At best the extremes of those cases under zero and first order but we have not considered the inhibition pattern , we have not considered the deactivation kinetics , mass transfer limitations and non - ideal flow behavior .   3.1637645561918344
That is we are considering only either a PFR or CSTR which is an ideal flow dynamics in the reactor .   3.6616800991181333
In many cases practical reactors may not be an ideal CSTR or ideal PFR .   3.2141623778169217
But in a large system it is always difficult to maintain and it is always desirable to identify or characterize your reactor with reference to flow behavior and then make a correction factor when the design part comes into .   4.073025256393741
Similarly if you consider that the flow behavior is drastically non - ideal there is a full channeling ; then corrections are to be applied to the design expression to get the reactor performance .   4.376547008922777
Welcome to this course on Polymer Chemistry , I am Dibakar Dhara .   2.2652968715416217
I belong to the Department of Chemistry of IIT , Kharagpur .   1.9269151383582994
In this course I planned to cover the following topics .   3.905958431475927
Then I plan to cover in details various polymerization processes .   2.2888130219921945
I talk about , I will talk about the kinetics and the mechanism of different polymer processes which includes step growth and chain growth polymerization .   3.91963091068553
I also will cover copolymerization specially the kinetics of free radical copolymerization , and then I will also cover other important polymerization techniques such as ring opening polymerization , and coordination polymers .   3.256795870772673
We we listen everywhere about the polymers , but what are polymers ?   2.591700807009722
If I want to just show you pictorially or schematically this is the representation of polymers , you have this structure units monomers and on polymerization its gives you a linkage between the polymers making a large molecules .   4.234896158667527
Polymers can be made from more than one monomers as well , different monomers which is showed in pictorial in two colors and in that case you get a polymers consist of two different structural units , you and we call them as copolymers .   4.277952378351774
Now , this term copolymers are used generally when you have a polymers which are synthesized from two different monomers where the monomers can be polymerized independently , which means in this case styrene as well as the MMA can be polymerized to , individually can aim to polystyrene and poly methyl methacrylate .   4.4181361464204505
There is other type of polymers which are also synthesized from two different monomers .   4.448345466589581
For example , if I take a example of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol , I have n molecules of this , n molecules of this which on polymerization gives you a polymers which is known as polyethylene terephthalate .   3.398032925357038
We get this pet bottles they are this , they are made of this polyethylene terephthalate .   3.6082656006367593
So , in this case this polymer pet is also made from two different monomers terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and we make a polymer , but generally generally we do not call this polymer as a copolymer whenever , because as I said earlier this monomer terephthalic acid or this ethylene glycol cannot be polymerized independently by all or individually , this terephthalic acid cannot be made polymers by itself or a ethylene glycol cannot be made polymer by this process .   3.5860582486849415
Let us look at this cartoon , if you compare as collection of small molecules or short molecules like a sugar and a long molecules which is a polymer sample .   4.786028636859911
Now , this is a case where the individual molecules are small in size , they are not entangled with each other .   4.033206518123908
So , you can easily take out rice from a bowl by a spoon .   2.964087011114365
Whereas in case of polymers because of the large size and its flexibility they are present in a mixture in a entangled well .   4.220000738089375
That means the polymer chains are entangled to each other and as they are entangled they cannot be moved independently with each other for example , real life example if I have a bowl of noodles and I ask you to take a spoon , no , one spoon of noodles , you cannot independently take out as a noodles to the spoon because they are entangled .   3.952916903183263
So , chains come together so when you take out a noodles you get a junk of polymer or no no pieces of noodles which you take out .   3.9859727118186714
Monomers , we talked about several times monomers .   3.0824755273645006
Monomers are molecules from which polymers are made .   2.888454727425304
They must have at least or functionality of two to that means they can be , no , reacted at least from two sides for example , we talked about styrene molecules or ethylene molecules which means they can be extended from two sides .   4.371029542787095
If you have a molecules which have only one functionality for example , instead of ethylene glycol you have a phenol molecules , then once this weights of phenol is reacted you , the chain does not goes , you you cannot make a polymers .   4.31044923520286
Repeating units it is a structure , a a polymer is formed from repeating units which means that when you write a polymer structures , the repeating unit is the unit which gets repeated .   3.988944316728786
For examples I talked about the ethylene molecule in or say simple example of say polystyrene molecule .   3.7093257151255052
This is styrene and when it polymerized its gives you polystyrene .   3.929628399206984
It is subscript of n , this is the units which gets repeated .   4.2376946942452145
So , if I want to write a structure of PET then I can take these units and put one after one to build the polymer units or the polymer molecules .   3.8946890760509123
So , just to clarify one more time , in case of styrene we have the styrene unit as as a repeat unit and in case of PET you have this unit away with a repeating unit .   4.537047947184658
Define degree of polymers , its , it is the number of structural units present in a polymer molecule .   3.99955102042915
What is structure units ?   2.89298540197552
Let us talk about the example I just showed you before .   3.8845342702316397
In the case of polystyrene this is repeating unit and this is also a structure unit because structural units is the unit which is derived from a monomer .   4.174255222459379
So , in this case this unit is coming from a single monomer of styrene which where double bound is replaced by a single molecules .   3.2518896090756546
So , in this case if n is number of repeat units then it each unit consist of two structure units because in this repeat units is derived from two monomers , one terephthalic acid unit , one ethylene glycol units .   3.4490680412108783
So , whereas in earlier case the number of repeating units were same as number of structural units .   3.5396730109589707
How did you define the degree of polymerization is the number of structure unit .   3.3326848266677787
So , in this case the polymer molecular weight will be degree of polymerization multiplied by the average of these two monomers minus the water molecules which have been eliminated , I will show you a example , real example in coming pages .   4.2923659878335245
So , that it will get clear little bit more , if it is not clear already .   4.851802204507388
You know in this case of styrene you have polystyrene in this case .   4.465994694696886
So , structural units is same as repeat units and in this case whether you have a say example of poly terephthalic acid PET terephthalate PET to it is the polymer is derived from two different units then the repeat units is this whereas , this consists of two structural units .   4.5461235163505185
So , if I take this this part then it this consist of four structural units , but only two repeat units and as I said degree of polymers is number of structural units , and the molecular weight of polymer molecules is degree of polymerization that means number of structural units multiplied by the average structure unit .   4.664741213486488
People ask for banning plastics , plastic bag , plastic shoes , plastics bottle everything you know , most of the applications of polymers are referred to as a application of plastics .   2.9902028833934047
Plastics has also more , have more scientific definitions which we come later , but at at this point you must remember that plastics are made of polymers , but not all polymers are plastics like there are several other applications where polymers are not used as plastics .   3.3750811999455923
Just one more time plastics are polymers , but not all polymers are plastics .   2.4025358484233124
Now , this knowing , what are polymers , what are plastics and what brings the good properties in polymers ?   3.482340788163454
Now , why why you are , you will ask me why you are , why you need to study polymers , why we should be interested in studying polymer or polymer chemistry .   3.502182966726233
There are hundreds of such examples I can give , maybe I will give in later classes , but I hope you are convinced that polymers is finding applications in several places and now a days when we talk about you know we , a scientist or the developer you know application specialist with thing for a new material application .   3.432042221081809
First thing comes into mind is a polymer and more often not a polymer becomes very often the material of choice for new applications .   3.5278473653388267
If you are still not convinced , if you think what you do once you wake up from bed you take a brush which is made up of plastic material , you use the toothpaste which contain polymer molecules , you take food , foods are also having natural polymers , the container sometimes we use , disposable plastics and you wear shirts , clothes which are made of polyesters , cottons these are all examples of polymers .   3.821456043520912
Then you come to office by a car or a bus or a cycle .   2.819560903473005
You name , you know wear shoes , everything .   1.9042193799444325
Now , you can argue me that these are very common common materials and these are no need for main development work for this .   3.7834739648838362
So , you do not need to study polymer because the knowledge or technical knowledge for this common applications are well established , but if you think about examples of polymer like a artificial valve which is made of polyethylene .   3.5448356873964224
Now , these are also application of polymers which it does not come to your mind immediately , but like this there are hundreds of very high end applications of polymers .   3.7232667423266124
For examples polymers are used in medicine , as a drug delivery vehicle , as a conservation with drugs , molecules and so many .   3.1125679522691163
So , in this case you require a definitive knowledge about polymers which will enable you to develop or innovate new polymer molecules or new polymer applications .   3.348864747454911
Now , when you use a plastic material like polycarbonate compared to a glass this becomes much lighter , you know its gives you lot of comfort than the glass .   3.6331416368571987
Now , because of the lighter of weights polymers used heavily in transportations like car automotive , in trains and all these things because the light you travel that will consume less fuel .   2.7825691519051974
You buy a cheap processing you can make , take the polymers which is comes in after from the lab or in a plant and you can do the polymer processing , do a process and make or give that polymer a very nice shapes of your choice and give good style which is not possible with the traditional materials like glass and metals .   3.6888916553433755
So , that you have , you do not have to limit it with number of polymers available , there are so many polymers available now in market .   4.398821009645773
So , it gives you the option of choosing a definite polymer or particular polymers for your choice of applications and of course , you know not more often and not it comes with a lower cost .   3.856992272552049
So , you have a polymer molecule which you synthesized in the lab .   3.8857072778441686
Now , when you synthesized you get it in solution or in a bulk .   2.9756815731517254
So , you have a polymer which is prepared in the plant which is coming either in solution or in a bulk .   3.46315373512201
So , you can use the emulsion as such .   3.3793001451547333
Now , where how do you get these polymers ?   3.188404845041534
There are some polymers or few polymers which comes from natural sources like polysaccharide cellulose and more often not these natural polymers , the polymers which comes from natural source are very useful .   3.3038520491322747
Most cases you get from petroleum resources , ultimately from a crude oil or in some cases you also get a monomers from renewable resources or bio resources .   3.103959411136278
So , now we have know where from a polymer is made .   3.528353479795592
In a detergent formulation you have surfactant polymers and other ingredients .   2.7511879388357343
So , in this case this are the applications which are which are where the minor , there is a minor fraction of polymers going , where polymers are used in a mixture in a solution or some other form whether polymers is either a you know active ingredient or is just act as a support role like enhancing the viscosity enhancer and so on .   3.7409870179489024
But in majority you know the major volume of polymer comes out in from the manufacturing plants , goes in the application where polymer is the major part you know , is a application of polymers is major .   4.291724843582561
You can have the other ingredients along with the polymer like a stabilizer fillers or pigments , but it is the polymers which is the major ingredient and other additives acts as a support which either enable the polymer to have you know better performance .   4.693153608239722
We call this as resins ; you might have seen this granules or pellets yourself in sometimes in the market and if the final applications is does not require very complicated geometry then in this process itself you can make the final product for example , like sheets film where in this processing step itself , the polymers are taken and the additives or fillers are added and it is given a shape of the final products like sheets and film etcetera , but this is not the major application this is the minor applications .   4.651060069217704
In most cases the polymer manufacturer makes this as a intermediate products and they sell this to its customer who makes the final product .   3.0574802512461394
Once the application of over polymers become a waste and its very important is as important as the earlier steps that we have a very good waste management system by which we can either , we use or recycle the polymers and if you cannot recycle or reuse the polymers then this waste of the polymer , the polymer waste has to be handled very carefully .   4.523698256790117
So , that it does not pollute the environment .   4.029924362057626
So , if I repeat this life stages and various transformation step you have a monomer which most often we get from petroleum products and from monomers by doing a step called polymerization we get the polymers in the plant or in a lab either in solution or in bulk or in some cases in emulsion form .   4.10660524048118
So , you have now the polymers .   3.381382264900718
These intermediate products are taken by the equipment manufacturer and by doing another processing step for example , injection molding they give the proper shape of the final applications where this polymer goes in .   3.0595643260062935
Now , let us come to a specific example .   3.2183363733545485
For example if I take a car head lamp cover , the cover of the car head lamp is nowadays made from polycarbonate material .   2.6257871900441465
Polycarbonate is synthesized from two monomers this phenol A and phosgene to give you polycarbonate .   3.1983886398254167
Now , how do you get , how this this is produced ?   3.5358821235108056
Where from this phenol comes from ?   2.0953367702652477
Where from this cumin comes from ?   1.9640154862967332
You take this polycarbonate as synthesized in a plant or in lab , add these additives , pigments etcetera and we are compounding strips and you get PC pellets .   3.5388814445655394
You you sell this PC plates to a cumin manufacturer which will make say injection molding and make the head lamp cover at OEM which will be sold to the car manufacture .   2.817791505272669
Now , a company which makes polycarbonate , which sells polycarbonate like say Bayer or SABIC .   2.317129329576943
Now , after making these pellet they sell it to original equipment manufacturer .   2.268789080335903
Now , what is the present focus of in a polymer research ?   4.309648357135792
If I go back to the earlier slide as I said that most of the current synthetic polymers are made up from monomers which are ultimately sourced from petroleum products as there is a increasing interested interest to make polymer from the monomers which are not source from petroleum products , because on using the polymers or making polymers from petroleum , there is a fear of you know depletion of petroleum resources .   4.475565400390272
And of course , there is a very highly important you know the more importance given specially from the government side about the waste management of polymers specially recycling of polymers and find the ways where you can we use the polymers and of course , the there is a need for research how to properly manage the polymer waste .   4.144343999704015
With this I we will stop this class .   4.01245774699286
In the coming class I will start with classifications of polymer .   4.334183909551977
Just to repeat what what I covered in this class , we talked about the definition of what are polymers ?   3.7058840555385997
Polymers are large molecules , which is made from repetition of structural units .   3.2302260861007035
Now , what are the different stages of polymers and then how the polymers are transformed from one stage to another and ultimately where how the polymer industry works and then we talked about finally about what are the important research areas in currently researcher focusing in polymer chemistry .   3.84340014425426
We will start in next class , continue the introduction and we start from the classification of polymers .   3.1993248605690403
In fact most of the enzyme catalyzed reaction that do take place in a living cell involves two substrates in most cases .   3.4956344126318855
We have also seen that under certain set of conditions the classical Michaelis Menten kinetics which has been proposed for single substrate enzymatic reactions can also be applied to bi - substrate reactions .   3.5156636128664323
Certain conditions apply but those conditions are by and large extreme conditions .   2.560915677171781
That is you have to have one of the substrate in a very large excess concentration .   6.090507271555522
Those situations may not really exist in a living cell .   2.127824374581377
Bulk of the bi - substrate reactions do fall in the category of either oxidoreductases or transferases or lipases .   2.7251357340388944
To account for the rate of reaction for such reactions taking example of a typical bi - substrate reaction as I have shown here in general I have left certain dots in between , in between the substrate as well as the product stream .   4.106764624325297
But in general the action of enzymes on a reaction involving two substrates A and B giving rise to products X and Y is expressed here .   3.4621675065036017
Again similar considerations as we talked about in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics .   2.870607977080574
He proposed the initial reaction rate for such a reaction can be given by an expression given here .   4.3145597815193995
Let us say this is expression one .   3.211864791310113
That means both the substrates are in large quantity and they are able to saturate the enzyme which in concentration terms is much , much smaller than the A or B .   4.519308049887816
The concentration of enzyme is much , much smaller than either A or B .   3.260397811989073
That means when we talk of KB , KB is that concentration of B at which the reaction velocity V is half of that of Vm at a saturating concentration of A .   3.717603208596795
Similarly for K that concentration of A at which the reaction velocity is half that of Vm at a saturating concentration of B .   3.3610859886469657
Or in other words we are analogous to our classical Michaelis Menten constant for the substrate .   3.0155069533922334
That means you can consider that KB is the Michaelis Menten constant with respect to B at saturating concentration of A .   3.7596385509230963
KA is the corresponding Michaelis Menten constant with respect to A .   3.1607565643508604
In most cases this dissociation constant is different than the apparent Michaelis Menten constant unlike in the case of single substrate reaction where the two are almost identical .   4.023408240693149
So therefore if let us say B is very large , B tends to infinity then V0 = Vm.A / KA + A Both from numerator and denominator divide by V some of the terms will be cancelled and you will end up with a simple expression like Michaelis Menten .   3.507648465772994
If you consider B as a constant at some value of B the expression will turn out to be analogous to Michaelis Menten constant .   4.018099268872604
If this becomes a constant parameter , at constant B you can write Vm.A.B / ( KB + B ) V0 = ( K ’ A.KB + KA.B ) / ( KB + B ) + A We have rearranged the general equation in the form of Michaelis Menten expression .   3.686538087822784
So therefore at any constant value of B you can consider that the apparent value of Km for A KA is K ’ A.KB + KA.B KAapp = KB + B This is the apparent Km with respect to A by rearranging this general equation .   4.302281715775958
It has no effect on the binding of B and so it is independent of concentration of B in the reaction mixture .   6.179759175386275
Similar situation will apply if you consider K ’ A.KB + KB.A Kmapp for B = KA + A Again here also similarly you will notice K ’ A = KA ; Kmapp for B KB This here also K ’ A = KA .   3.2921893491870597
The other substrate concentration will influence the magnitude of Kappm in the case of a bi - substrate reaction whereas in the case of a single substrate reaction the Km value was almost analogous under the assumption that the term turn over number that is K2 term is not very , very small .   4.600613027707842
Otherwise if it is very small they have a difference but if it is not very small the two are analogous .   5.490788041990842
This is your maximum reaction velocity and your half Vm will be this one where KA apparent with respect to substrate A will be K ’ A.KB + KA.B KAapp = KB + B Similarly here this situation will become V0 when the value of B is saturating .   3.832479201534585
It will be Vm when the value of B is saturating .   3.8020520906844246
At any other V value of B the rate profile will be a hyperbolic profile analogous to that of Michaelis Menten constant .   3.535986315359024
Another way to look at this kinetic expression is , just like we have been looking under all the cases of single substrate reaction , double reciprocal plots which will also give us the magnitude of all the kinetic parameters that are involved .   5.265486628861681
If you plot this at a constant value of V just like in the first case when we take constant value of V , you will get a profile with B increasing at different constant value of V .   3.740715337878679
If you recall what we did in the case of the inhibition patterns , we took the double reciprocal plots and then took slopes and intercept and made secondary plot .   3.746960532276216
In the case of intercept the slope will be KB / Vm and intercept of 1 / Vm .   3.391713016129809
Therefore by a double reciprocal plot at different concentrations of B and plotting the 1 / B versus the slope and intercept one can determine the values of the four kinetic parameters that are involved in a bi - substrate reaction that is KA , KB , K ’ A and Vm .   3.450071472356163
These are the four kinetic parameters unlike in the case of a single substrate reaction where we are concerned only with two kinetic parameters Km and Vm .   3.5331736487872214
One can determine experimentally , the various kinetic parameters in the case of a bi - substrate reaction .   3.1050333360116262
We have just kept it in a black box some interaction takes place by which the products are formed and some general rate expression have been arrived at which involves certain kinetic parameters which have been considered in analogy to single substrate reaction because the kinetic analysis of enzyme catalyzed reactions have been so much dominated by Michaelis Menten kinetics that any new mechanism or any proposed mechanism must be interpreted in the light of those Km and Vm as parameters and that is what we have done .   3.989947013560366
We must also look at the possible kind of interactions that are likely to take place and almost all the interactions between enzyme and substrate for bi - substrate reactions have been classified into some general forms .   3.659143121221891
When I talk of ternary complex formation I am referring to a ternary complex formation before the product is formed .   3.4020030361931117
It can start by binding first with the A and then B will hook on to that or it can start with EB and then A will hook on to that or in other words that you will notice just like in the case of the non competitive inhibition the A and B both have separate binding sites on the enzyme molecule and therefore they don ’ t interfere with each other and randomly they can bind and once the ternary complex formation has taken place the product formation will begin .   3.9672306943608024
EAB then goes to form your E plus X plus Y .   2.3188090650062816
E k1 k4 k - 1k - 4 EA EB k - 2 k - 3 k2 EAB E + X + Y There will be rate constant at this state k1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 , k - 3 , k4 and k - 4 .   3.7964139561551278
Typical example is yeast alcohol dehydrogenase which follows such a kind of mechanism .   2.939610158248263
For example yeast alcohol dehydrogenase follows a random ternary complex formation as a part of the dynamics of their enzyme substrate interaction whereas the same enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase from the mammalian cells doesn ’ t follow this kind of mechanism ; it follows an ordered mechanism where it can bind only to one of the substrate first before the second substrate can bind and that ’ s why the kinetic parameter will automatically turn out to be different .   4.003750849297804
In specific cases they may be equal also .   2.6380647189197624
Here the ternary complex EAB can be formed from only one of the complex EA .   4.542377664182691
I have taken hypothetically EA it could be EB also and only one of the binary complex has to trigger the enzyme substrate interaction and then the other substrate will interact with the EA complex .   4.662564869211733
The reaction cannot proceed in this direction that is B cannot bind to the free E and the reaction has to proceed in an anticlockwise fashion that means after E has bound to A , B will bind to EA , EAB will be formed and ultimately this will form EY releasing one of the products let us say X and then this will release another product Y and they will be let us say k3 , k4 .   4.309503001743992
But the product formation will take place only after the ternary complex formation has begun .   3.5446690035389214
A special case of ordered ternary complex formation is Thorell and Chance mechanism because in many of the enzyme catalyzed reactions , Thorell and Chance observed that ternary complex is not a very stable entity and it exists only for a short period of time .   3.375900645118389
That means the half life of the ternary complex is very , very small in this scheme .   3.090957444349207
Although they never said that the ternary complex formation doesn ’ t take place , they agreed that ternary complex formation is taking place but the half life of the ternary complex is very small and before that the second substrate can interact with the EA to form the first product .   3.6904457039687797
Or in other words you can have E again going to EA and then this EA can then convert into EY releasing a product X and then this EY can give you back E releasing another product Y and you can have k1 , k - 1 , k2 and k3 .   3.6941762284443462
But it is only a special case of an ordered mechanism where ordered ternary complex formation is not denied .   3.9559652689972933
One can also consider either as a special case of ternary complex formation or a special case of binary complex formation .   3.2185939718046686
But binary complex cannot lead to a product .   2.472340686243617
The fourth mechanism which represents the binary complex formation is Ping - Pong mechanism .   2.82360087965031
That means the product may be one the substrates may be two .   3.508960546466707
That means as soon as the EA of the first binary complex is formed the interaction with the second substrate forms a product , first product or it splits off to a product and a modified enzyme substrate complex which then reacts with B to form Y .   4.1390265505033135
Therefore E reacts with A to form EA with k1 and k - 1 .   2.384976544298237
Right at this stage itself the product will be formed which is X and this will be EA ’ and this is k2 .   4.460445376910523
As soon as the first binary subjects complex is formed one of the product is released .   4.118107505587096
Then the next substrate interacts and the next product is released .   3.2588845330222447
So that is what happens in such cases and a large number of transferases , most of the bulk of tranferases fall in the category of ping pong reaction mechanism excepting those of the yeast source and most of the mammalian hexokinases form under the category of ping pong .   4.017472312412855
They lead to the classification of ping pong mechanism .   2.4423186035483395
When we look into these mechanisms and develop steady state rate expressions specifically you will end up in quite complex situations .   3.3654454475735323
EA ’ is hypothetical in the sense it may not be a binary complex .   3.6002437593578365
It will be more clear it is E ’ , the enzyme in the modified form .   3.8526853810053208
The first substrate has reacted and released the product .   3.074821746254965
Enzyme is modified and second substrate attacks and then releases another product .   2.527782992089236
That would be a better interpretation .   2.374347043316235
Whereas in the case of Thorell and Chance mechanism this will be a binary complex , this will not be a modified enzyme .   3.736746200229133
When we look at these reaction mechanisms with the increased order of complexity between the dynamics of enzyme substrate interaction , the rate expression will also be quite complex if you put them in terms of individual rate constants .   4.6260781211587085
Each of the reaction mechanism involves particularly the random ternary complex formation will involve nine rate constants four reversible and one irreversible step , nine rate constant and the expression will be quite complex .   3.574202007453876
In practice to derive expression may be quite complex and we are talking only a binary substrate complex formation that might be enzymatic reaction which may involve three substrates and system will be still more complex .   3.672299059196145
Before I go to give you the rate expression for these different mechanisms I like to introduce you to a simplified methodology for writing a rate expression under a steady state hypothesis .   4.114729048619576
Of course the steady state hypothesis is valid .   2.4456840029119307
The method was proposed by King and Altmen way back in 1956 .   2.1977152349155182
They analyzed number of reaction mechanisms and using matrix algebra they wrote down rate expression for different kinetic mechanisms and all steady state expressions can be solved out .   2.9143592618863625
Ultimately making some generalizations from those matrix algebra , Wong and Hans in 1962 proposed certain set of simplified rules almost like empirical rules .   2.229316764261373
Although they are based on hard core mathematics matrix algebra he generalized certain rules so that by observation of the reaction mechanism as long as you can write a reaction mechanism one can arrive at a rate expression in a simplistic way .   4.106595265374301
I will try to introduce you with that kind of a system taking a simple example so that , that can be applied to our complex binding substrate system to arrive at the actual rate expressions .   3.72113344073308
The kind of system we will take for simplicity will be a two enzyme substrate complex formation ES going to ET going to E plus P .   3.8717998899049304
k1 k2 k3 E + S ES ET E + P k - 1 k - 2 k - 3 We can take a reversible system k1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 , k - 3 .   3.1755853498310262
To illustrate the procedure followed I chose this reaction mechanism .   2.404204610160146
The very first step in such a procedure as proposed by Wong and Hans is that we need to write any reaction mechanism in a cyclic form .   3.888942454243192
Cyclic form means you will have inter conversions of the enzyme substrate complexes .   3.9084841566528334
For example here as you notice enzyme species can exist in the form of E , ES and ET in three forms .   3.545533226201519
So the whole reaction mechanism can be interpreted in the form of a triangle with three vertices , each vertex representing one of the enzyme species .   4.101140920640953
Therefore you can write such a reaction mechanism as E , ES and ET .   3.334649398107941
Now show the inter convention of each of the enzyme species say for example E ES , ES ET and ET E .   3.3511125516776104
ES E ET Let us say this is your Sk1 , k - 1 , k2 , k - 2 , k3 and pk - 3 .   3.7429165607783865
We write the rate constant for all these steps in the cyclic form making them in the kind of a first order rate constant .   4.172017045221751
For example wherever there is substrate involved in binding over enzyme the rate constant can be written as Sk1 .   4.082358450779143
Where there is no substrate involved only simple rate constant can be written and similarly wherever ET is going to form the product in the reverse direction , the product concentration will be incorporated The inter conversions of the enzyme forms involved in each step must be described by a term called Kappa .   3.71555747553918
The conversion of the rate constant or interpreting each of these steps in terms of first order rate constant term is called Kappa .   4.363138030352879
Then we consider each enzyme species in sequence .   3.4235408893781765
For example we take E and consider all the possible pathways by which E is formed in this cyclic manner .   3.4894543778467533
E can be formed by all the possible pathway involving n - 1 steps .   2.4682206691609445
That means if there are three enzyme species number of species are n and n - 1 steps will be involved in each pathway .   3.8117060681328905
We identify that E can be formed by this and this .   2.3498611010636195
Similarly you can form this and this .   3.0227236317483306
Write all the possible pathways which are feasible to form and this is for E .   3.568039733224632
What I am trying to explain is that for each of the enzyme species write down all the path ways involving n - 1 steps .   2.7905613905935955
That means if it is a three enzyme species system , if there are three enzyme species in the system then each path way must consist of two steps which can form the enzyme species E or any enzyme species which we are considering .   4.999359090326193
One of the considerations in such a system is that all the path ways that converges at a particular enzyme species are permissible .   4.457075001300469
But the path way which leaves the enzyme species in both directions is not permissible .   3.453456848968448
That is a system like this will not be permissible if it happens .   4.221487413950086
Are you clear ?   1.3599376314945697
For each of the enzyme species we work out the path way by which these species may be synthesized .   3.284031591759159
Each path way must consist of n - 1 steps where n is the number of enzyme species present and the product of the kappas of the steps in each pathway is determined .   3.2643032748808163
You can write the kappas here and you can have the kappa product .   4.609822138686873
For example what is the kappa product for this pathway ?   5.654531323329189
pk - 1 , k - 3 .   1.0845366579960063
This pathway is represented by this and this .   2.4232513120379076
So the product of this Kappa is this .   4.046268654160739
In this case it is k - 2 and k - 1of this one and the third path way will be pk2 k - 3 .   4.2860223040618886
We are talking of E .   3.4016721110400834
In this expression we are writing for the formation of the enzyme species E .   6.865030663132243
These arrows represent this and this .   1.8734168803664826
sk1 does not form E .   1.9316351268414815
sk1 form ES .   1.3533920618000017
k - 2 forms E by ES .   1.6777150971850252
What we mentioned is that we are considering only pathways which have two steps n - 1 steps and any steps which lead to formation of E involving two steps will be considered .   3.646684442911427
First pathway involves two steps this one and this one .   2.3897764410119673
They are only the steps which are involved in formation of E .   4.577293961349082
They are just generalized rules .   2.7145763596141257
Otherwise you have to go to the matrix algebra to solve the simultaneous equations and you will arrive at the same thing .   4.464461897617175
Wong and Hans simplified the whole matrix algebra did by King and Altmen and formed certain rules .   2.1269119811998816
He said that you form a cyclic reaction mechanism and write down the pathway for each of the enzyme species or for example we can take any simpler case let us take probably the simplest case E plus P .   4.224491503428118
E + S ES E + P k1 , k - 1 and k2 .   1.9907499277608656
I try to write this one using the same you will arrive at for the same expression as Michaelis Menten equation .   3.9608958262091303
For such simple system writing by observation will look to be more difficult than solving the steady state equation but if you have let us say more than one enzyme substrate complex it may look to be simpler to write by observation .   4.2488990156113475
‘ n ’ represents the number of enzyme species involved in the mechanism , whereas in the case of what I showed we have three enzyme species E , ES and ET .   3.8307524062395326
It will be expressed in the cyclic form by a triangle each enzyme species represented on the vertex of the triangle and each of the path way which should be considered for the formation of enzyme species must have n - 1 steps .   3.7617914471726666
This is how you define a pathway .   4.300111233509652
It ’ s not a pathway in the sense of metabolic pathway .   2.770114279923926
It ’ s the number of steps involved in formation of that each having n - 1 step .   3.9252230270365187
So I think we will stop at this point .   2.1553985239226074
Welcome to this 12th lecture of course in Polymer Chemistry .   2.1663915666549176
And in this lecture I plan to continue the discussion on chain transfer reaction and their implications .   4.301217433182903
And then we talk about the inhibition and retardation reactions , we talk about how to determine or what is the procedure of determination of different reaction rates , rate of initiation , rate of termination rate of polymerization .   4.996099808941611
And we talk about and discuss now how to determine the rate constant different rate constant , and we will discuss about their magnitudes and we go next to the auto acceleration gel effect .   4.752457284638158
And then finally we will talk about effect of temperature and polymerization rate and as well as effect of temperature and molecular weight of polymers .   5.494142870690802
In last lecture we introduced different types of chain reactions possible and we also convince our self that if there is a chain transfer reaction , expect if the chain transfer is by the reaction with a polymer chain dead polymer chain .   5.186425151523856
In all other cases the chain transfer happens then molecular weight will come down .   4.0810108955626
And we also introduced the term kinetic chain length how it is related to the average number number average degrees of polymerization .   3.8359304940202783
And how we can determine the number of residual initiator residues per chain and how that is related to the number of degrees of polymerization .   4.449327288335776
Now , let us continue the discussion having the last lecture on the chain transfer reaction .   4.259794065734582
Now , we had discussed this , these molecules and their reactivity , now as we are discussing that if the more stable radical will have a tendency to react or undergo transfer reaction compared to the less stable one .   4.7430673685674805
Now , let us look at the values of this solvents C s is the chain transfer constant for the solvent .   4.961763725890196
So , the higher the value the higher is the tendency for that solvent to undergo transfer reaction .   4.364211016775169
Now , we have listed here the values for two monomers , polymerization two monomers polymerization styrene and polymerization of vinyl acetate .   3.6496077792753505
And look at the value , you will know that this is the more stable radical then this secondary radical then this one then this and in this case because again this is a primary radical .   5.045700116528017
So , this stability would be similar to stability of this radical .   3.477733023019514
So , look at the number again benzene cyclohexane toluene if you increase go toluene to ethyl benzene isopropyl benzene the tendency of transfer reaction goes up .   3.171748655636942
And again we go to tarsalbutyl benzene , because again it is a primary radical , we are talking about if the tendency of transfer reaction goes down .   3.718019809232503
Now , this happens to vinyl acetate as well , but look at the comparison between vinyl acetatestyrene , vinyl acetates are the numbers for vinyl acetate are R , so higher .   3.681467502855296
So , tendency of the solvents for transfer reaction for vinyl acetate is higher compared to a polymer reaction of styrene .   3.504152602990231
Now , what could be reason between the difference in this tendency of the solvent towards different monomers , again as we discussed in the last lecture if this propagating radical is very reactive .   4.334849857998455
Then obviously , it will react for both the monomer as well as the solvent in this case if it is less reactive then it will choose the most feasible root .   4.927814935392747
Now , between styrene radical the propagating radical from astyrene polymerization , vinyl acetate polymerization this is much more reactive compared to a styrene radical generated from styrene molecule .   3.2887705875038336
So , this will react much more to with the solvent molecule in this case .   4.305950391916977
So , that is the reason this is this transfer constant as much higher value compared to styrene .   3.731610393938528
So , if we want to list or rank between different monomers , the rank of the reactivity would be something like this it is vinyl chloride higher than vinyl acetate , acrylo nitrile methyl acrylate , methyl methacrylate styrene and so on .   3.421173269051327
So , you can yourself from your knowledge from organic chemistry you can justify this ranking , because this is the most reactive radical generates from vinyl chloride will be much reactive compared to the other ones .   4.476210321092402
This lacks any significant stabilization mechanism either by resonance or by inductive effect , whereas , a styrene will have stabilization radical generated from styrene will have the stabilization by resonance .   2.68972811716951
So , the reactivity of that radical will come down .   4.339709168256367
Now , this is this ranking does not hold always there are cases where there is a specific interaction or putting a affinity between monomer molecule plus solvent , there is specific affinity between this .   3.406608273751859
If for example , if the monomer is electron donor it will have more tendency to react with a solvent which is electron acceptor , whereas if the monomer is a electron acceptor it will have a tendency to react with electron donating solvent , for let us compare between two monomer and two solvent and see whether , we can justify or we can have this verified from the experimental data .   4.427301738681013
Now , I consider tri ethyl amine as a solvent now it is electron reach , so electron and c c l 4 which is electron acceptor solvent .   3.5128431322509694
Now , I compare between acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate , now acrylonitrile is a electron accepting monomer , where this is electron .   3.6976491136853036
So , obliviously this will have more tendency for react or undergoing transfer reaction with c c l 4 than trim ethylamine .   2.477541192121149
And between this two monomers acrylonitrile have more tendency to undergoing transfer reaction with amine compared to vinyl acetate .   2.8570881717484844
So , if you compare the values and put a third monomer M M a methyl methacrylate which is again a electron accepting monomer and let us see whether it is more generic .   4.026903316257481
So , acrylonitrile will prefer reacting with this as a transfer reaction compared to this whereas , vinyl acetate will be reacting more with this than this .   3.5579095176246516
So , compare vinyl acetate it has more tendency to transfer reaction with C C L 4 , but the acrylonitrile has more tendencyto undergoing tri methylamine .   2.507941311498147
Now , between then comes a competition for same solvent two monomers because this is donor it will have more reacting transfer reaction tendency with acrylonitrile .   2.9144062975847795
So , if you look tri ethyl amine the value is higher for acrylonitrile than vinyl acetate .   3.803147624199238
So , you can justify the values for methyl methacrylate , which is again a electron accepting monomer .   3.3057439359462735
So , in what is the utility of transfer reaction or what is what it can help you in this learning on transfer reaction if .   5.020420657752879
Say if you are your trying to polymerize a monomer and then at the end you are not able to get the H high enough molecular weight which you planned from your experiment .   4.1161519927573735
Then what are the possibilities it could happen if it does not build molecular weight ; that means , and you know that from the monomer structure that it is it is polymerizable by say radical polymerization root .   4.8084741502973785
Then it there could be transfer reactions happening it could be happening with monomer initiator or solvent or they could be impurities present in the reaction medium .   3.937660535565934
Now , if you can remove you can do the reaction once again remembering all the impurities and still if you can get or you do not get the higher molecular weight , then what you need to look for is the structure for initiator and the monomers solvent .   5.659404517305241
Whether they can take part in the transfer reactions and you have to rule out the possibilities , if you rule out all the possibilities have the transfer reactions by appropriate choosing the initiator and the solvent .   3.980561391567367
Then you can you can built the moleculate if it is the transfer reaction is because the monomer then then there is no other alternative we have choose different monomer al together .   4.564876215513317
If there is a transfer reaction is happening with the monomer .   4.624449970782437
Then they is other way you can build them monomer molecular weight , because you have use the monomers to meet the polymer .   3.9517981447473804
Now , if you found in the reaction they is high very high molecular weight , which you do not what then what you can do you can use this chain transfer agents which we have .   5.926803964581083
Now , what would be the chain good transfer agent which can easy participate in chain transfer reactions and those does molecules like S S N thiol , now containing S S N thiol .   3.28698100175985
For example , if I look the values for one butane thiol this number is very high , because in this case this is a very week bound .   4.938619554242463
So , easy this hydrogen can be very easy accept by the propo vinyl acetate radicals , why using this type of chain transfer tri ethyl are butane thiol compounds the compounds you can reduce are control your molecular weight much to of your choose or if your target .   3.2136542478376433
Now , if you look at this solvents carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra boride they are also have very high chain transfer constant .   3.6083520150941477
That means , this solvents are very poor solvents if you want to build higher molecular weight in the radical polymerization .   4.207312065013212
The reason for this monomers are the solvents to participate in chain transfer reaction is because of there stability of stabilization of the resulting irons .   3.5312078106203058
So , if I have for example , I talk about one participating transfer reaction it produce this radical .   4.630357266536537
Now , this is can be easy stabilized by all this roaming molecular , which can participation the reguise instructed .   2.878408643939113
So , this that is the reason that this type of solvent carbon tetra chloride and in specially carbon tetra boride participation the chain transfer reaction very much high extent .   4.356032207494384
So , always avoid in this type of solvent for alginated only in that sense because alginated solvent will always breezily it can be easily acceptable .   3.348008428991671
Now , always its try to avoid these acrylonitrile solvent specially for this carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra boride type solvents .   2.2676941588909965
Now , if I look at that transfer reaction one more time , so if I take a mu , so YB inter x a am writing YB and now it is producing M n Y plus B dot , k z is the red constant for reaction .   3.883699559437746
Now , if this b dot which is this radical is very stable that it is does not take part in further reaction , further chain in reaction , it might degrade or it may react with itself forming non radical sphere .   3.877700349642816
But , it does not react with the monomers to initiate he chain molecules a new chain or if it is at all reactive with monomer the rate is very , very small which means practically in this reaction transfer reaction you are producing a death chain .   4.121054279077583
Even if you are producing an radical which is as good as death death chain , because it is not talking part in initiation of a mu chain .   3.8890013846205527
In this case what happen if k z is much higher then k p which means that this reactions this happening at much higher extent compare to the normal propagation reaction then you will not have a polymer at all , because as soon as this chain initiate it will react with this and form a death chain .   4.67517919110365
So , we will not have at all any polymers , so polymer is get inhibited .   4.354319451890015
So , it is a inhibition reaction and this YB is a inhibitor if k z is little higher or may be comparable with k p , then are even part of the M n is under going this reaction and part of the M n is undergoing normal propagation reaction .   3.845640012264899
So , what happen your rate of polymerization it become slower , so this is retardation and the molecule called retardence .   4.588251846044077
For example , if I talk about a self initiated thermal polymerization , polymerization of benzene styrene a 100 degree centigrade this is percentage of conversation and this is time , is normally have reaction rate of reaction like this by time more propagation happenings .   3.8885229850240886
So , more monomer is undergoing polymerization reaction , so higher is the conversation .   3.4454516228733816
If I had this is 0 percent any external molecule there is no external molecule in this case , if it is 0 percent 0.1 percent benzoquinone , benzoquinone this is benzoquinone .   4.24695341328891
So , what happen for some time there is no polymerization reaction at all the monomers is not consuming at all , which means as soon as radical is form it is reacting with your benzoquinone present .   4.228801443222989
So , there is no polymer no monomer is converting in to polymer once this benzoquinone is over then the polymerization reaction start normally .   3.6500622387374193
Now , this is a typical example how this common monomers are shift or store , because most monomers when there are shift from between different countries are locally there are stabilized with small amount of this inviters .   3.355596772563263
For example , hydroquinone or benzoquinone , because there should not self polymerizes either by little bit of heat oil from the binateor or by self initiation reaction .   3.1341051059552987
So , when you do reaction base to s to disallowed that benzoquinone hydroquinone stabilizer or inviter or you can add little excess initiator compensating the inviter molecule .   3.0568766104622633
So , that we do the reaction till all the benzoquinone and hydroquinone gets consume after that normal reaction happens .   3.377684840888216
There is a third possibility is like this 0.5 percent nitrobenzene nitro benzene in this case reactions starts from beginning , but with the much smaller rate .   3.645740890515739
So , it is a example of a retardation there would be four possible , which is a combination of inhibition and retardation something like this a starts at a sometimes as well as the reaction is slower , this happens if we add 0.2 percent nitro benzene .   4.473895389882961
So , this as a the reaction possible with different types of this is the typical or happen if your inhibitor or retardation or a combination of both of that and examples of inhibitors again this is when this radicals is very stable .   4.887001355542652
For example , if I have a butyl butylated hydroxy toluene , when this forms a radical where from a hydrogen you can am not writing you can imagine that the dot will come here .   3.2122539818110774
And which is extremely stable radical which does not participate in the nutrition reaction it might degrade or react with self , but it does not participate example of a inhibitor .   3.6585278815630597
The other example is like 2 2 Di Phanyl Picryl Hydrazyl DPPH , when it reacts with this this is extremely it does not react with any monomer it reacts with the only radicals and form a non radical specious this benzo hydroquinone can react with a propagating radical .   3.9835150603382976
And from either this or this radical both of the , which her resitable radical .   2.9287966949693205
So , that is a reason there act as a inhibitor molecule .   3.5283749801985613
Another very common inhibitor which we come across at always is oxygen .   2.875343057974472
This can react with this self form non radical specious and this can form with other M n dot and can form a non radical specious .   4.1450528134814055
So , that is the reason , that the transfer coefficient or or the transfer constant is very high for the reaction that is the tendency of oxygen molecule to undergo this reaction is very extremely high .   4.777214926542577
So , which means that when you do reactions chain polymerization reaction , radical chain polymerization reaction is must remove the oxygen molecule from the reaction medium as much as possible .   4.009821872255636
To avoid this killing of the radical propagating radical by which it will stop the reaction and also reduce the molecular weight .   3.8069536511496076
So , we have now learnt transfer reaction and inhibitor inhibition relation and retardation reaction as well ; now let us talk about how one determine this different rates experimentally by experiment .   3.5963054741389393
Now , R p which is the disappears of the monomer or reaction of monomer from the reaction medium , you can directly determined the monomers consideration by talking a alicot from the reaction medium .   4.062869125791074
And precipitating the polymer and then waying the polymer to find out the healed , which means waste is the monomer , so by which you can know what is the monomer present or how much monomer is reacted directly do at from a solution .   4.31671396842766
So , direct aligcot can be taken at different time M and the polymer can be fastigiated out from the reaction ; second you can directly measure the concentration either by spectroscopic technique or any chemical techniques .   3.676412511961411
Now , it can be applied not only for radical polymerization these experiments can be done for step polymerization as well .   4.330113861925228
Where you can stop the reaction in between and find out the functional group , in case of step polymerization by in case of these is the conservation monomer molecule , so from this you can get the value of R p .   4.974609456558787
Now , we get it once s more time this the expression for k p is just for your reminder that this is this .   4.836524511028447
So , we know this now from the experiment and we can find out the concentration of aim as well , so this k p and M dot are the two unknown quantities .   5.126687762001851
Now , this M dot in in theory or in principle can be found out directly from a sides measurements which get the total initiator concentration specially at that stage , this stage .   3.54204753116784
For because the life time or the life time of this radicals are very small is normal user technique is not very accurate to find out the concentration or M M dot the valve of M dot .   3.9504449358546556
So , a sides does not give a very accurate results of the M dot value .   3.7795223095901127
Now , we know R I is minus d I by d t .   4.17742324260103
So , we can find out the I initiator molecule concentration of time , so we know we know the value of R I .   4.9560324045676305
So , we know value of R I we also can find out the value of I .   5.504459788117752
So , we know the value of f k d this known now this is known this is known , so you know this is for thermal thermal polymerization .   4.976849501870918
So , you we can write the expression one more time for the rate of polymerization for thermal polymerization is k d I by k t to the power half .   4.423567350465389
Now , in this expression e e know this , we know this we know this , we know this , we know this , this is all known .   3.225966048582725
So , what is unknown is k p by k t by half , so this is unknown quality , rest of the things we know from experiment .   4.735228441908586
Now , how do we get this , to get this we found the average life time we defined average life time of a radical at steady state at steady state tau s is the concentration of total radical species as steady state by the rate of termination square or 1 by 2 k t .   4.377478441603603
So , now , this can be we can put this value of R p here , so we can get k p M by twice k t R p at steady state , so if you know tau s we know k p by R p .   5.288957820720554
So , from the value of tau s we know k p by k t this is known this is known , so this by this as to be unknown this is unknown .   3.4808898883746457
So , we know this , so we know this we know this if we both are known then obviously k t is known and k t is known k p is also known , so this is the logic .   4.5007868409586145
Now , how do you determine this there two establish method , one is rotating sector method and second is PLPSEC , which is Pals Laser Polymerization Size Exclusion Comotography plases lesere polymerization size exsultion conmoetrgraphi .   2.3654781552487685
Now , am not going in to detain about this method how there how there use to determine the value of tau s , but because this is not the scope of the courses , but if for your knowledge that this are the method are applied to get the value of tau s .   3.9268842006767892
And now once you know the value of tau s we know this and we know from this expression this , so we know k p k t .   6.067917871346309
So , now we know that by experimentally we can know the rates the individual rates we know R I , we know R p , we know R t and we also know k d , k p , k t we know all this from experiments .   4.498244290215798
Now , what is the typical values of this what are the typical values for radical polymerization R I is twice f k d I k d is 10 to the power minus 6 10 to the power 4 second typically used .   4.144648070524984
So , R t comes around similarly r P M M dot M dot value typically is between 10 to the power minus 9 to the 10 to the power minus 7 hole square liter , k p is 10 to the power 2 10 to the power 4 liter mole inverse second inverse so R p value is R p value is minus 4 by minus 6 mole detain inverse .   3.7612339150146825
And R t is twice k t M dot square M dot value is listed here , k t his 10 to the power 6 10 to the power 8 liter whole inverse second inverse .   3.212271058452167
See , if you compare the values typical this are the typical values now the values would be different for different monomers and solvent choices .   3.470757855710485
And also it would vary on depend it would vary on various methods , we have utilized to determine this values .   3.180172847352753
So , depends on the method depends on the monomers and the choice of solvent , but this are the typical values of the different rate constant and rates .   4.709101740383495
Now , look at this number k d is very small where k p is much higher compare to k d .   4.647408969338854
So , the destination are the initiation reaction is very slow k p is first .   5.184248011381658
So , the propagation reaction is fast and termination reaction is much faster .   5.2751499753002165
But , it does mean the rate all rate of termination is faster because the concentration of M dot his very low rate constant is very high the intrinsic the reaction his intrinsic very fast but because the concentration of the radically specious is very low the rate of termination is also low and that actually enables is to reach a steady state .   4.239003805951821
So , again just for one more time that the initiation rate constant his much lower compare to a propagation chain propagation which is much faster reaction very termaist much faster even faster reaction .   3.624568833187259
But , at this state there rate of rate of inhibition and rate of termination becomes 12 because the concentration of M dot is much lower it is about 10 to the power minus 8 moles per liter .   4.469320178101375
Now , what are the assumption if did use this expression R p his k p a M , what are the assumption we made one was that initiation was slow , propagation his fast and termination was even faster .   3.327401081635904
We had convinced our self now with the values of individual rate constant that our assumption was not , not in accurate assumption was accurate .   3.2377880231098732
We also assume that the individual rate constant for the propagation steps where equal .   4.0388291192308285
That means , the reactivity of a propagating radical towards a monomer does not depend among the length of the polymer chain at the end of which the radical is present .   4.8239800428133925
And we have found that to be true as well what we did not , which we did not consider is that giving polymer reaction , we know that is a H O thermic reaction .   4.343310063371178
Now , once the H O thermic reaction happen , if we do not have arrangements to take out that heat which his evolve chain the reaction , then there will be change in temperature .   3.9199512601252806
If we cannot take out that heat which his generated by the exothermic reaction giving the polymerization process why effectively , then the temperature is raise and once the temperature we raise all this red constant will also vary .   3.5974167312796537
So , the rate of polymerization is also vary , if we cannot take out this the heat which is generated due to polymerization reaction that we did not consider did using at this steady state kinetics .   3.801279842732306
Now , if I consider this then how this rate will look like .   3.2540820100032377
So let us plot R p verses conversation for a bulk polymerization ; that means , 100 percent polymerization again , remember R p is k p M M dot .   3.58550360757443
Now , initially before the steady state happened M dot increase slowly before it steady state happen .   2.5409473607877953
So , with very low conversation to take little time to , so that his the transient non steady state , before the steady state happen .   3.2266756739552265
This transient happen this is the transient is is transient it does in take much longer time , does not take too much conversation to achieve that .   3.374648771058482
Now , once this steady state reached R t will be all most constant , but with time what happen to concentration aim , monomer consideration decreases steady state means the concentration of M dot is fixed the time .   3.3868801315748804
So , no change in the concentration of M dot this is constant and steady state , but with more and more reaction happening , more and more conversion is happening .   3.617756551168988
M n M should put down concentration monomer should go down , so R p go down slowly , so it go down slowly .   3.147973349532746
Now , if at this movement the the medium viscosity is quite high what happened if the if the medium viscosity as become very high , so that the chains are not diffusing at the same rate when the viscosity was lower .   4.598215417553737
Now , we know to termination to happen termination is a by molecular reaction between say to to propagate radical , we know termination would be by add a coupling or by this propagation reaction .   3.3160783456666105
Now , if this two cannot defuse fasten off to find each other and react then obviously the termination rate will come down , it will become diffusion control ; that means , the intrinsic is very fast .   4.589484285117873
But , the rate at which this two radical his finding each other is determined the diffusivity of the this molecules .   3.339789740484968
So , the termination reaction becomes diffusion control the higher is the diffusion higher is the termination reaction , but because the medium viscosity is quit high , so diffusion rate is low .   4.257406672160501
So , the termination reaction his low now once the termination reaction his low steady state is lost .   3.350677130940315
So , more and more radicals are not terminated now because here the termination his come down , so the concentration of M dot increase .   3.400970824443123
Because , the viscosity is very high if the reaction the termination reaction his become diffusion control it is difficult that the propagating radical finding difficult to by other propagating propagating radicals to undergo a by molecular termination reaction .   4.262460171510827
So , the reaction the concentration of the radical the propagating radical goes up .   4.797302368983028
Now , once this concentration goes up what happen to the rate if this goes up rates goes up rates goes up now we know del H is negative exothermic reaction , once rate goes up goes up more and more heat involved and more heat involved means will know in a minute that of if we increase the temperature the medium rate of polymerization even goes up .   4.012867267134547
So , whatever if there auto acceleration is happening because rates goes up rate of polymerization goes up more heat is generated more heat is generated we cannot take out effectively that because the medium is high .   3.1092497371619414
So , temperature goes up as a temperature goes up rate of polymerization again goes up , as a rate of polymerization goes up more and more heat is generated .   3.7341462044712546
So , basically there is auto acceleration the rates zooms the rate of polymerization becomes to much accelerated as a results you get a gel at the end .   3.8460586270241115
So , you get a gel is very high viscous material , so it is a gel effect this called gel effect , this is gel effect or is called effect , this is steady state .   4.490392730455561
Now , for a bulk polymerization this rates comes down rustically at the end will come and discuss why in a minute from now .   3.73220970542388
So , this is in a actual case if the rate of polymerization depends on the conversation , now obviously this gel effect whether it will exists or if exists at what conversion that will depend upon the viscosity of the medium .   4.087455223459262
If you are doing reaction in the solution then if you are concentration in the monomer in the solution is slower , then viscosity does in go up that much and because the polymers are forming in a solution the heat management is very good .   5.516929917756726
So , there is not heat acumination as a low increase in temperature , so the gel effect does not happen .   3.736988224892207
So , we plot a methyl methylacrylate polymerization at 50 degree centigrade in benzene by benzoquinone polyoxide initiator it is look like this time percentage conversion .   3.3876253798133917
It is basically gives the rate of the polymerization times verses conversion gives you rate of polymerization .   4.274538122201338
When the 10 percent monomer in the solution the reaction you are doing in a dilute condition the heat management is very good , viscosity is not high , so no gel effect happen .   3.4211844119885164
If you do it in a little higher say about 40 percent you get like this if you say 60 percent is the 60 percent monomer in the solution , you gel effect 80 percent you get even before the this 100 , 100 percent conversion , this is bulk .   3.7798100583199283
This conversion verses time gives you rate of polymerization if you do it at a 10 percent concentration then the rate goes down slowly , but no gel effect happen if does in happen for 40 percent as well .   3.380676486065314
What if the concentration of the monomer is very high 60 percent , then there is a gel effect .   4.942908093361764
If it is even higher the viscosity for the medium becomes very high even at low conversion at lower time .   4.1236826980135115
At 80 percent at gel effect initiates as much lower conversation at lower time or even for bulk which is 100 percent monomer it happens even before that .   2.9400706888898918
So , you are now convinced or you understand this understood this concept .   3.2007335117671185
Now , one thing you might have noticed that for 100 percent bulk whether 80 or 60 percent it as reached a 100 percent conversion of the monomer where for the bulk polymerization 100 percent of the monomer as not reacted and make polymers , it as not polymerized 100 percent .   3.842055004018489
All the monomers present in the medium there have not polymerized , now what would be the reason now we know glass transition temperature I have not discussed in this till now will discussed in later .   4.310276043934346
But , time being glass transition is a temperature at which a polymer becomes soft below which polymer become glassy .   2.7883410092684353
So , the mobility of the polymer chains becomes very low below the glass transition temperature the mobility of the polymer segments is very low and they have no translation emotion there is no translation movement of the polymer molecules .   4.787749886142434
Now if you do the reaction at the temperature which is below T g now T g for polymethyl methyl acrylate is little excess then 100 is close to 100 .   3.9690786520842165
So , if you do a reaction say at 50 degree centigrade or 60 degree centigrade that his below the T g glass transition temperature .   4.363508107310735
Now , T g of the polymer also becomes slower in presences of solvent in this case M M a as a monomer , which is called plasticization which is basically the reduction of T g in presences of any solvent in this case solvent is the monomer itself .   5.312299947441654
So , it is Tg is drops down as long as reaction temperature is below above T g of the polymer in that condition the chains or mobility .   4.472756760373825
So , the kinetic chains have mobility .   3.8714357582478556
So , there can react with the monomer and participate in a polymerization reaction the movement the reaction temperature becomes below of the T g of the polymers in that medium the polymers lose all the mobility .   4.490414527532945
So , reaction stops the polymers becomes classy , so no low reactions can happen .   2.4102423973072318
And this reduction of T g from original 100 degree for polymethyl methyl acryculate we be lower reduction means the T g value will becoming down more and more if you have more and more monomer in the medium .   4.2546303247245785
So , if you increase the conversation that may be more and more polymer forming less and less monomer present in the medium then means the T g of the polymer present is becoming higher and higher because you are reducing the amount of monomer present in the media .   4.596507180954642
So , if I this is temperature and this is 100 degree centigrade is your T g for t n M a in this case this is mole friction of the polymer , if this monomer mole fraction of the polymer is one then the T g would be 100 degree centigrade for the pure polymer .   5.346634822080243
If you have little amount of monomer then T g will come down plasticization will happen more monomer more plasticization .   4.341725585495155
So , you if you draw T g with mole fraction you are going to get like this , so this your glassy part .   3.8895650797473627
So , you have to carry out reaction the temperature below above glass transition temperature and you the glass transition temperature come down with more and more monomer present in the system of the polymerization medium .   4.844618519109584
So , in the bulk polymerization as this is the point where the T g as become lower T g of that polymer present in this case as become higher then the reaction temperature if the reaction temperature is 60 degree in this case 50 degree .   7.386135923165415
So , reaction m is 50 degree for T g this polymers as become higher than 50 degree , so no more conversation can happen ; at this conversation T g of this polymer present T g of the polymethyl methyl acrylate present here at become higher then 50 degree which is the reaction medium .   4.072438063361836
So , once the polymer become glassy then the polymer chain the kinetic chain are not participate for the reaction and cannot take the cannot make new polymers .   4.3898149234370125
So , in this glassy region the polymer cannot the temperature is below the glass transition it cannot make any more further any more it can take up participate in further polymerization .   3.6349401939669312
So , what we going to do in the next lecture is we what to find out the effect of temperature in the polymerization rate .   4.209886011956024
And also the effect of temperature on the molecular weight of the resulting polymer and will talk about thermodynamics of the chain radical chain polymerization in the next lecture .   4.221648433673136
We will continue today our discussion on enzymatic catalysis and particularly the ways in which the enzyme can lower the free energy of activation of a chemical reaction it catalysis .   4.09938807846648
In our earlier lecture we have noted that enzymes can lower the free energy of activation of a reaction very effectively as compared to chemical catalyst .   3.038756623240806
However this catalytic efficiency is attributed to two major molecular strategies that we had discussed earlier and they are binding of the substrates to the enzyme on the active site mainly the major play ground here is active site present on the enzyme molecule .   4.266740191359102
On the other hand the stabilization of the transition state of the chemical reaction which is the desired reaction which you want to catalyze .   5.210175789726336
These are the two molecular strategies which are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme .   3.7937208055920055
Here I like to draw your attention about active site .   2.356119775182238
You see in both cases the active site on the enzyme molecule play a very key role in the variety of functions or variety of mechanisms that we will discuss today .   4.203291308482049
Before we go in to main mechanism I like to summarize some of the characteristic features of enzyme active sites at least the major one which may be of interest in today ’ s lecture .   3.805417164037255
The enzyme active sites determines the catalytic properties and specificity of the enzyme and these properties are determined by the chemical groups attributed by the amino acids present on the particular small region what we understand as active site .   3.881586323443159
This region , the so called active site may constitute less than 5 % of the total surface area present on the enzyme protein .   3.321056542784374
It ’ s a very small area on the total enzyme surface and rest of the enzyme surface either in its proximity provides some favorable reactions or very often it may be considered as only a sort of building framework structural feature which creates the active site .   3.992156945928091
The creation of active site on the surface of an enzyme molecule is brought about by tertiary folding of the enzyme protein .   3.2918576225139837
All the enzymes we talk about are all globular proteins , structural proteins are not involved in catalysis and therefore the rest of the amino acids by virtue of their folding pattern creates certain niches , certain crevices , cleft on the surface of the molecule which acts as active site and the functional groups attributed by the amino acids in that cleft take key role in binding as well as catalytic process .   4.173791529274075
The active site is usually located in a cleft or crevice .   2.7177678152317
Active site although present on the surface has its own three dimensional entity .   2.9124517869166793
It has two distinct functions binding of the substrates and catalysis and both the functions are a result of the amino acid residues present there primarily and then the shape , which is brought about by the conformation .   4.051390187782582
The enzymes exhibit remarkable specificity because of their precise fit between their binding sites and their substrate .   3.0711106323932027
Considering the active site it is a combination of two functional entities : one is the binding site , substrate binding site plus the catalytic site .   4.603429601417442
Enzyme protein , as some of you may be aware , has enough number of ligand binding sites .   2.2670431138980094
Substrate binding sites are one of them .   3.4428195213795356
The active site consists of the substrate binding site plus catalytic site .   4.220274022865764
It does not catalyze the reaction it will only remain as a ligand binding site .   3.6409334700506952
Typical substrate binding energies range from 3 - 12 kcal mol - 1 .   2.0497318794548804
That is the order of magnitude which the binding energy goes in the binding of the substrate .   4.651867299955651
Another feature is that not all the twenty amino acids that are present in protein are involved in active sites .   3.5141055322590273
Just by observation of the variety of enzymes which have been studied so far , it is noted that only a few amino acids usually polar in nature they participate directly in catalysis - cystein , histidine , serine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid and lysine .   3.227316364200407
You can see that all of them are polar in nature and these are the usual amino acids which constitute the primary functional groups on the active sites .   4.192910116215089
In some cases the terminal carboxylic and amino groups are also involved whenever by tertiary folding they come in the proximity of the active site .   2.9266195367972254
Not that on the terminal side if they are far away from active site they will play a role .   3.228153548699969
Once by folding process if they come and become a part of the active site , the amino and carboxylic groups are also important in the catalytic function but again they are also polar in nature .   3.624129513235212
By meaning that they participate directly in the catalysis I mean that they are present at the active site .   3.7586215452129172
The involvement of certain amino acids at the active site is a result of the whole folding process in which all amino acids are involved .   3.796907455894373
So while we say that these are amino acids that are present on the active site and they participate in the catalysis does not mean that the other amino acids which are playing a role in the folding process have no relevance .   3.916289965427365
If one of the amino acids is transferred or removed the whole folding will change and primarily involved means those which are physically present on the active site .   3.2177767081702937
But their presence in the active site may result from the whole composition of the protein as well as the folding process .   4.3252080590509445
Another feature which we need to keep in mind is that certain enzymes require cofactors .   2.7963149303470907
The precise reason for that is amino acid side chains cannot catalyze all the chemical reactions .   2.658755302030909
That is one of limitations although the protein design or the enzyme design has been so beautifully evolved that a large variety of reactions can be catalyzed but still there are limitations .   3.2921154131424335
One of that is that the available twenty amino acids are not able to catalyze all the reactions .   5.216813820403044
The limitation is on the electron acceptors .   2.4150946840832423
None of the amino acids are good electron acceptors and many reactions which are primarily based on electron acceptors require additional input in the form of cofactors .   3.4095348243050783
For example the cofactors like NAD , NADP , they are all ideal electron acceptors and they participate in the catalytic process simply by oxidation , reduction or whatever mechanism is involved .   3.3549071495655083
Therefore small organic molecules or even metal ions provide electron acceptor or some other chemical potentialities in addition to proteins for catalytic function .   2.6916840932853834
So that is one limitation that while most of the reactions can be catalyzed by the amino acids present on the active site , certain reactions which are not possible to be catalyzed by this can be carried out by cofactors and that provides a key role for catalytic function .   4.422095185179792
Just to recall our earlier discussion on the previous day we mentioned that the energy of activation E * can be broken down into two components that is your enthalpy contribution as well as entropic contribution .   3.803358540407522
We can break down the reaction and the classical Arrhenius equation , the expression for rate constant can be written as k = RT / Nh exp ( ?   4.559362534584235
S * / R ) exp ( - ?   1.7167898949418487
H * / RT ) The rate enhancement process consists of two different components or the energy of activation consists of enthalpic as well as entropic contribution .   3.1411575663544364
So by any means if the enzyme can either reduce the enthalpic contribution to the free energy of activation or entropic contribution , the net result will be a catalytic function .   4.525870194213832
While considering the various ways we will consider the lowering of energy of activation through each of the contributions and first we will see lowering of energy of activation through entropic contributions .   3.6063925331712237
Consider a bimolecular reaction in which A and B participate to from AB * as a transition state .   3.2016711861006084
The entropy of these molecules will consist of translational as well as rotational degrees of freedom .   3.991446813895326
Three degrees of translational freedom and three rotational for each of the molecule A and B .   3.1069310453792225
The two molecules will have six degrees of freedom .   3.2763085549041246
Once the reactants A and B bind to an enzyme molecule at the active site there are only half of the their degree of freedom that means they become one entity and they lose six of their degrees of freedom and thereby there is a loss of rotational and translational entropy and the transition state will have only three degrees of rotational and three degrees of the translational freedom each .   3.9337273676530597
You must understand that the net result of binding of the two reactants to the active site involves in reducing the degrees of freedom of the two reactant molecules and therefore there is a loss of entropy .   5.085290593671442
In the case of A and B acting in the absence of any catalyst , in our case we are considering enzyme as catalyst , when the transition state compound is formed there is a loss of entropy .   4.220887239464197
Now this loss of entropy is accounted for in the energy of activation .   2.654634891963791
Whereas in the case of enzymatic catalysis the loss of entropy as a result of combining into one entity is attributed in the binding process which are already taking place in the binding process .   3.62282758148932
When the enzyme substrate complex forms a transition state there is no loss of entropy affecting and the loss of entropy as a result of enzyme binding compensates for the reduction in the free energy of activation .   4.349580672621904
This binding energy can be of the order of about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 at 25ºc and if you take the two reactants at one molar concentration , the computation will tell that it will be about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 .   4.076218333074215
Simply by entropic contribution of binding the enzyme can reduce the energy of activation by about 10 - 15 kcalmol - 1 .   3.0628282005126906
Just to repeat , we should consider two different cases .   2.8804375173770658
In one case A and B are present in a solution in which there is no catalyst .   5.3135831863306535
Ultimately for the reaction to take place they have to pass through a transition state .   3.131380464065853
This A and B both have to colloid and make an unstable compound .   2.5402425372743944
It will lead to loss of entropy and this loss of entropy will then be accounted for in the energy of activation .   2.9596225269693766
This loss of entropy has to be provided in terms of the energy of activation .   3.7687253555189955
But when you talk about enzymatic catalysis this loss of entropy is compensated by binding process .   2.961611520870895
That means whatever loss of entropy is there in the binding process that is not to be provided in the energy of activation .   4.260233968962168
There will be loss of entropy but that will result in the range of energy during binding process .   3.565465012787393
Whereas from the bound enzyme substrate complex to go to the transition state there will be no loss of entropy and that entropy gain will account for advantage in the entropic contribution to the energy of activation and this is one of the major contribution in reduction and activation energy as a result of substrate binding .   4.2409453830685315
One point must be kept in mind that such an advantage due to entropic contributions for the energy of activation will be more pronounced if they are multi substrate reactions .   3.2264588051162115
If suppose there is a unimolecular reaction one may say that there is hardly any advantage .   3.9432450597147284
There are hardly any unimolecular reactions as far as an enzyme is concerned expecting certain isomerases because most of the reactions are bi or trimolecular .   4.034060765090992
There are some , but not many in numbers .   3.166444452369494
In the case of unimolecular reactions this entropic contribution will not be very significant .   3.909128048066345
There will be another mechanism which will play a role .   2.848436885216295
The reduction in the activation energy is not through one mechanism .   3.0680488546072664
There are various mechanisms and the net gain is sum total of the kind of mechanism that are involved in specific enzymes and in case of unimolecular reactions the entropic contribution may be quite insignificant .   4.359363567664442
The binding of the substrate to the enzyme molecule is not a process which is within the purview of activation or transition state .   3.944410559040265
The enzyme substrate complex must not be confused with a part in the transition state complex .   4.200750277534347
It is a totally different process which , particularly the enzyme substrate complex is a result of a large number of non covalent interactions between enzyme and substrate , hydrogen bonding or Vander Waal ’ s forces .   3.4569445142163553
Whereas from the enzyme substrate complex to transition state is a totally different phenomenon and the energy required to go from an enzyme substrate complex to transition state is the amount of activation energy required for the reaction .   4.061835820705819
The binding energy is a totally different game and therefore that should not be confused .   3.3144251382172127
Very often we might make a judgement that the energy which has gone into enzyme substrate binding is not a part of activation energy , is not required for catalytic process , for activation energy to be equalized .   3.952135762461863
This effect of entropic contribution to the energy of activation is called approximation effect or propinquity effect .   2.6325394972674943
You bring the reactants into to a close box so that they act as one and they function .   3.437159484352605
As a result of this approximation one can also consider another feature .   3.182605654732352
When the substrates are bound on the active site the effective local concentration of the two reactants in the active site will also be much larger than the concentration in the free solution .   5.415780593356679
The substrate is now localized for the reaction at the active site whatever is the volume of active site in a given enzyme molecule .   6.015298149370966
This concentration of the reactant at the active site will be many fold higher compared to the actual concentration in the bulk phase in the aqueous medium in which the substrates are dissolved .   5.031921282979886
The higher concentration of the substrate at the active site means that the enzyme provides a new micro environment in which the substrate concentrations are much higher than in the bulk and you get the net effect of higher substrate concentration on the reaction rate .   4.886937466967907
Average perplexity: 3.777256590678746
