Due to the reason of the permanent weakening of walls of stomach there is a chance for hernia to occur once more for second time through surgery.   3.3402078121847305
One of the main causes of hernia to occur is the weakening of walls of stomach.   2.9795408090496633

Generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient , his family history and the examination of regions like groin , navel etc.   3.1105144486951968
Apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor.   4.07608811581341

If the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time , this treatment in itself is satisfactory.   4.040545935241645
There is a knot , and therefore it has to be removed , it is not necessary.   4.17141184866655
If the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously , if the woman is panicking , the symptoms increase , the symptoms of bleeding , pain and pressure appear , then only it should be removed.   4.1253561576457685
If the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy.   3.5576445375280437
The fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers.   2.6047699788423118
There are two types of operations for fibroid.   3.22897243590471
Myomactomy removal of knot only , this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy opening stomach.   2.437144617682846
Just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children.   3.6654815952864843
Hysterectomy : If the age is not less , the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor.   3.068241039195318
Medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia.   2.9591343062872415
Some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid.   3.7859445423440006
GnRH analog decapeptyl or lupride , mifepristone , danazol are the main medicines.   2.1253839740544898
But due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced.   3.874346093697408
The condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine.   2.8901825499990235
The modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis through laser Nd-YYAG.   1.8796695150648213
The blocking of uterine artery ambolization.   1.7725138678272379
In modern treatment the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl particles or gel foam powder through a pipe entered through the thigh artery after anaesthesising it.   2.429547102304779
By blocking the uterine artery the blood supply available to the tumor gets obstructed and the tumor reduces up to 60 %.   2.603055329417824
A skilful gynaecologist is capable of doing proper treatment after considering everything.   2.491809363058491
Therefore , it is unnecessary to be scared of leiomyoma disease.   2.439380512894365
The investigation of the secrets of brain -.   1.8608536212025528
If we gradually cut open with a saw and separate the upper part of the skull of a man after making him unconscious on an operation table then by peering inside we can ourselves see the live brain with our own eyes.   3.044513978052147
Similarly , neuro-surgeons operate the brain by cutting the skull bones with saw and drill.   2.2381584139830926
Bacterial dysentery occurs from a special type of bacteria bacilli.   2.8261881439229586
Many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it.   2.4658937458657717
Through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself Einstein , C.V.Raman , Tagore and Shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas.   2.69048100919523
By look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity.   2.401252759528742
On investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell , neuron or nerve cell.   3.560840870146861
In bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm.   2.4714765968070727
Disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment.   2.8794897236285966
The disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in India.   3.174370235436543
In the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and a very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell.   4.528536893941347
In women , men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner.   3.6415548369017685
By disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them.   3.1209854513398225
The matter which fascinated Kahal the most , that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells.   2.499006830746484
In this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell.   3.0316403367584774
The axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains a certain distance between the two.   3.1741396842845297
Kahal studied these network places with great minuteness , which later on were given the name of synapse by Sir Charles Sherrington.   2.5812180592786995
How does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell ?.   2.776317202725938
There are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse.Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine.   2.875600604009967
Consciously a valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over , it has to take the help of a chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded.   3.302743529718441
After all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system ?.   2.4935320837653885
What is the benefit of this : The question is in fact very interesting and important.   3.5901779632377564
If we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only , not haphazard.   3.063731740266238
Every synapse gives unidirectional instruction , because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only.   2.709457822088786
In fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire.   2.6426656439324767
But the direction gets decided at every synapse , because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell.   3.4998767636344126
Thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction.   2.1656218918657606
Without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos.   2.2951269751230776
The second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is a delay of approximately the thousandth part of a second or 1.0 milli second.   4.002172455687335
This way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time.   3.1373362897617247
The more the synapses in a neuronal circuit , the slower would be the communication in them.   2.5781594885675228
Synapse has one more use as well.   1.830753931744781
Because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain.   3.3388973702104305
These chemical substances are called medicines.   1.9777073483421908
Many medicines given by the doctors today - like anaesthesia to make unconscious , tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace , and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only.   2.5950082796469807
Why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself , to understand it will not be now difficult.   3.086626813681861
Therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses.   3.768219776908771
The person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery.   4.187432137923377
Every cell in itself appears to be very simple as a unit , but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually.   3.011780154940636
Perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence , consciousness and memory.   2.3310590096508355
From the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts.   2.2772942895075676
Because of being enclosed in a box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep a direct contact with all the distant parts of the body.   4.495561913905717
Therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important.   3.505685738859931
Like a thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back , spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones.   3.414980819407117
At regular interval , through the medium of 31 spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body.   3.073653427573816
Each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs , and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles.   2.5057781636101253
The spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis , it does not disturb the brain for everything.   3.298692226996963
For example , it maintains a proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect.   3.099928999328191
We withdraw hand when all of a sudden a pin pierces finger.   2.1718322149846854
This reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord.   2.5852440192018804
The simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only.   2.605116415829512
Apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like a highway alone.   3.2988171279276624
The entire caravan of all the signals between brain and different parts of the body crosses through this spinal cord alone.   3.143702596795151
Thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious.   2.2263199383198926
But now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord.   3.0006417420008544
The brain starts just as we enter the head.   2.9253748133806616
Or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain.   3.1077555771689016
On seeing it appears as if the brain is like a very big walnut resting on a strong stem or branch.   3.743705364753841
Therefore we can divide the brain into 2 parts.   1.951253898534022
One is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it.   3.1983810537983466
In fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord , and it is also situated in its straight line , but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively.   3.9919294781606443
The lowest most part is medulla oblongata , very small and common in appearance but very special in importance.   2.380373659491263
The various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone.   2.5444562498028396
Like , breathing , beating of heart , controlling of blood pressure , digestion of food etc..   3.0504262151242365
A sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in a moment.   2.452786796766782
But there is nothing to get scared in this.   2.7900077936234764
Nature has placed this very important control-room in a very safe place at the center of the head.   3.1351117160337956
At times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely , and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged.   2.577765918534325
The ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death.   2.695336706997003
The same happens when the criminals are hanged.   2.0600808618094755
Medulla alone is the originating place of 7 out of 12 cranial nerves as well.   2.1073054311219397
The cranial nerves control the muscles of face , tongue , shoulders etc., bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs.   2.752252667558389
If we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and mid-brain come.   2.532834015162572
Mid-brain and pons mainly work as junction.   1.746002809383649
In a way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway.   3.049293158338171
Similarly 3 branches go to the cerebellum mini brain located at the back of brain-stem.   2.8941832181329503
Like a skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs.   2.216454397746328
First , because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags.   2.9661643440175487
We do not fall even when fleeing , running , doing acrobats , bending forward - backward.   2.6252489155818526
Second , this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely.   1.9162381963297166
Cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions.   1.8720664058890828
Earlier we mentioned 12 cranial nerves out of which 7 had their origin from medulla.   2.2535456181844196
Similarly 4 more emanate from pons mid-brain.   1.5626019066044292
Their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face.   3.5683110474600834
Now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain - cerebrum or fore-brain.   3.054430866665815
On crossing this line one gets to feel a very important difference.   3.216997193976314
From the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state.   3.314320689697123
From darkness to light.   1.4769808236057342
We have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brain-stem or cerebellum.   2.7253190728427255
As if we are sleeping in a very deep sleep.   3.336472438812957
But just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake.   3.0698722691438802
We start feeling comfort , sadness.   2.0204798249075684
We feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like a machine.   2.8940711261328915
We start saying I am there , I am doing , I am liking it.   2.265650749641736
Does any machine feel like this ?.   1.7737411428275367
None of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours.   2.1748667620277784
Let us forget for a moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see.   2.692927079575776
The brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both.   3.614886361390343
And why should not it be  After all both have to control respiration , heart , food , blood pressure etc..   2.5309950206465945
While jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body.   2.772361833850033
But when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is a huge difference between mouse and man.   3.4773357882639515
Our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain.   2.871790080718826
Because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body.   4.1559372696196615
Although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours.   2.542186432814372
The weight of brain of our closest relative , monkeys , is just half a kilogram.   2.948433665525898
The weight of the brain of whale is 8000th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around 50th part of the weight of our body.   4.31784120530918
If the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than 150 times of the brain of whale.   3.8779600671835843
There is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been a riddle for us even now.   4.00352063133443
This is divided into two parts , which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres.   3.827055238748253
Strange thing is this , that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body.   3.435593103315959
All the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side.   3.110635676689064
This very system is found in all the organisms.   4.362072150621254
The effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body.   4.839343366858933
Similarly , on pricking a needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere.   3.2896000351135615
Like a modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in a very good manner.   3.2768401848089206
The upper thick surface of 3 mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only.   2.640191899390916
In the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread.   3.2151632590714807
The small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle.   2.372362287409504
The most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision , while a very small part at the center does hearing.   3.8244729118800582
The system of olfaction is at the lower surface.   2.847289756631894
Though this part in man has become very unimportant in comparison to animals like dogs.   3.2584779836785294
But we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain.   2.510643273597396
Only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves.   2.371265230859705
So who is seeing , hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum ?.   2.4978705480670036
Is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain ?.   2.3579965346643905
This is a complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed.   2.682061108861698
Approximately 1 cm wide and 6 cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called ` motor cortex ' and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone.   3.6579795745102923
The representation of body here also is inverted only : head down and legs up.   2.2579629546090247
What is the secret behind this chaotic system , even no one knows this nicely.   2.6908282503519656
It can happen that one day you may solve this mystery.   2.9484261022816067
A similar strip near the motor cortex is called ` sensory cortex ' where all the sensations from the other half of the body come.   3.1479896236285896
Touch , heat , pressure , pricking everything is felt here only.   1.8218463448889899
But how this : We feel pain in finger when thorn pricks , but not in head.   2.499546605186446
But if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed.   3.146768628054572
Then only we realize pain.   2.0706380680975527
The pain is in finger , this is only a natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger.   3.513135244588995
Roughly we can conclude this , that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system.   2.705636835335587
If the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted.   3.841264370231793
Similarly , the moment a nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment.   2.72132198737177
We can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like.   3.685052060635402
This is called paralysis.   3.6381626992167186
Nothing has happened to the muscles , not even to the motor cortex.   2.896810002966169
Only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut.   2.9861388829466753
Similarly , now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain.   2.753116981421012
Similarly , we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs.   3.6440387278856696
In today 's mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life.   3.061423807041917
We say that heart is like a pump , eyes like a camera , nerves are like electric wires.and brain ?.   2.6126138331782465
Quickly the answer would be that the brain is a computer.   2.8218231148742667
Today at every place , whether classroom or shop , office or home , the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations.   2.3660278590030592
We have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers.   2.6668391230226973
Our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication , division , addition and subtraction.   2.717296551499481
But are the methods of both same ?.   2.3884089482325264
In future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us ?.   2.3580304448453147
Does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big , or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate ?.   3.2467846440115546
Such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance.   1.876983387431923
In the efforts to solve the questions , on one the hand the development of computers is getting a lot of help as well.   4.112343118147046
Right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in a better way.   3.0051995902392603
Due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in a better way we should first make its small and simple model.   3.406758995048785
In schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes , steam engines , radio etc.so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these.   2.4726260867888
Why not we study a small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain ?.   2.1930002069683754
We should make a child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work , multiply 9 by 9 , and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with 9 again.   2.9191697362422744
The computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off.   4.0742133552298565
But the child will throw away his paper and pencil in a few minutes and will in fact start questioning you , oh , why are you making me do this useless work.   3.119349123157649
What does this mean : I am tired , leave , I will not do anymore.   2.3716500708759196
If we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes , while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer.   2.986891739305832
The child soon gets bored with useless work.   2.671369750381071
There is unlimited variation in his thinking , not definiteness like computer.   3.0991080478240574
He will suddenly find out a new solution to any question which no one had told him before.   2.4944129123449783
Will any computer start thinking about gravitation like Newton when an apple falls on it ?.   2.074186172286522
Or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like Darwin ?.   2.802552800329549
One more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone , not in computer.   3.357549735109114
Many times we commit such mistakes while speaking.   2.91932809441015
The professor of Oxford William Spooner is very famous for this.   2.024029144629969
Thus it is also called spoonerism.   3.0978018171000965
At present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain.   3.2118086715814225
If we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions.   3.351203907159598
It is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence , consciousness , prudence etc to which the best of today 's computers have not been able to reach.   4.266559297053894
In future it will ever be able to reach , there is doubt in it.   3.2928818381965144
But there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain , and here lies its actual usefulness.   3.5240764603936863
The computer can do any calculation very fast , while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil.   2.693146374528663
The computer which plays chess made by Dr Hans Berliner selects the most suitable move from 175000 moves on analyzing them in just 1 second.   2.3098857923942164
Till that time we will not even be able to count up to five.   3.50966739474061
That is why in controlling fast moving spaceships , rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer.   2.587357384411769
Similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them.   2.783398275799221
Now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects.   2.6966996187941414
In one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only.   3.522906018161541
The way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette.   2.7247734488330466
But if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken ?.   3.0718834727772277
Is it therefore that we have to spend 20-25 years on education in schools and colleges ?.   2.799431070469782
No matter how advanced or clever the computer is , it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn.   3.0195810334080146
Whether 2 has to be added to 2 or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science , our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them.   2.816314095671692
Our brain has programmed the computer , but who programs our brain ?.   2.1752228783191367
Opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned anti-reflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain , that is , cerebrum.   3.533045117839768
Therefore these have the maximum importance in man.   2.435807671482711
By making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other.   2.42438543225739
Pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education.   3.361149445826957
Perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through a systematic language.   2.4898568523881566
First we point to a child a moving elephant on a road and say that see that is elephant.   2.5182735122418545
Then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it.   2.335271134482785
Finally , only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain.   2.59069915014905
Is it not a matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge , black quadruple having long trunks.   2.9137530271160332
It seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain.   2.4722972029348647
Can the present human society be imagined without language ?.   2.0801313839488276
Is science , history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language , or not make them permanent by writing ?.   2.8329293365485144
Scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language , but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them.   2.7606557048633755
In the past few years Roger Sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain.   2.9953588630461216
While receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm on December 8 , 1981 he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them.   2.950129616103375
When there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosum-the bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle , so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side.   3.2894947325269133
The daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results.   2.3223557592020194
Though we certainly get description of two-headed animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will a person with two brains or split brain think actually.   2.5362211118144766
In the words of Roger Sperry if a person with split brain attended a party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him.   3.6035843790282525
Both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body.   2.427521154177934
But after an in-depth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is a huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres.   3.576605797270337
Everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal.   3.4127255199451563
In maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous.   2.5445450853852862
The same thing has also been seen in all the animals.   3.642596397389914
It can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective , and like a class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere.   3.4940409856928243
But when Roger Sperry severed the contact between the two hemispheres then how special is the place of each in our mental activities was estimated for the first time.   3.0516726996631203
If we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this -.   2.664009223110381
Left hemisphere - language speaking , cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard , maths , analysis of problems , estimation of time.   2.403991702092678
Right hemisphere - geometry , painting , instrumental music , organization of facts , estimation of space.   1.8831397195099453
Whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division.   3.5952344028115264
But because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed.   3.4308186509756697
On the contrary the matter of the patients of Roger Sperry is in fact indeed exquisite.   4.130150683987342
Whatever one cerebral hemisphere learns the other does not get to know anything about that.   2.6430352082686905
As a simple example if a pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded.   3.8207904961481907
The contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin.   3.6473807374815244
With how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments !.   2.4417796559070015
One attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth.   2.575458900749117
In any huge class some students would be uncommon.   2.1324374023614387
That is , instead of playing , writing , eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand.   3.3988980448946857
These left handed players however have a distinct grandeur in cricket.   1.8502094829485607
What is their ratio in your school or classroom ?.   2.812339530739916
In what subjects do they get more marks : Or in what do they take more interest : How is their speaking ability.   2.907854335833144
If we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys , small kids and adults in this respect.   3.0374326280641255
But firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale.   3.559587003260836
To reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this.   2.299301419088666
Breast cancer is a scary name for women.   2.452356872473539
Thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days.   2.7990406354290736
Maximum succumb financially to breast cancer.   1.5581583224134088
The patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery.   4.124359178234674
If cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity , even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent.   3.1804699356054384
This way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture.   3.7627287517397883
In contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits.   3.391754545339386
Many methods of cancer detection like mammography , MRI , CT scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible.   2.726261580978235
In such situation the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography.   2.1827322939276033
In infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays.   2.6475345657302416
Greek and Egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body.   2.8496193159950596
Sir William Herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in 1800.   1.9271572284260547
But till 1970 it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine.   2.267596567888818
On passing the rays through the prism , the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light.   3.3736830475100628
In this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately.   2.687216274078508
This ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ.   2.6339195995702984
Electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments.   2.2323800604553234
Different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition , which on recognition the disease is diagnosed.   2.9215411077319016
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment.   3.4381927500683713
Of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important.   2.088879929482592
Because of less information in it , it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography.   4.210606295183181
Lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography.   1.830066705147703
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc..   3.995817005805155
Several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes a very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases.   3.1899642947447115
Any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called STD , that is , sexually transmitted disease.   2.403056439941332
Neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from STD.   3.0287197584752055
Some infections together with the complications related to womb , disease of liver may even lead to HIV AIDS.   3.0536821650079635
There are approximately 20 types of sexually transmitted infections.   3.669916663201177
STD spreads through bacteria , parasites and virus.   1.7644889064838327
Out of them some of the STD which spread rapidly are as following.   2.9647609701751287
HPV , that is , human pappiloma virus is a viral disease.   1.9344819025842899
HPV disease engulfs around 80 % of the total people who make physical relations.   2.519154609895341
The infection of HPV is of more than 100 types and 3 types of infections out of these spread through sex.   3.454077395318034
HPV infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women.   2.2836843630027532
On being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus , hips or neck.   2.883921807459715
For protection from HPV infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible.   2.742543382647616
Even if you make relations then also use latex condoms.   2.9028652510576243
Complete riddance from HPV infection can not however be obtained.   2.063740764110668
But by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief.   3.1958675552993547
Genital herpes is also a viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners.   3.8049162104924505
Genital herpes is of two types.   1.6688684226752233
After the genital herpes infection , inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus , which causes pain.   2.853723961716124
Genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching.   2.9138959153703397
Apart from this , in women , this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge.   3.4085319632168303
In order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners.   2.6769173699145754
Even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection.   3.180542531303465
If pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby.   3.001967929035468
Syphilis is a bacterial infection.   1.8177889485167231
Syphilis affects lips , mouth , kidneys and genitals.   1.8239785436310256
Apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her child.   3.210700697833542
In the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain.   3.9938213363918527
At times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all.   3.634037154430012
Many times people ignore it.   2.7940115578079805
These inflammations are not permanent , that is , they keep coming and going.   2.4151371064678795
Therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years.   2.550418130506611
Apart from diseases like AIDS , syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness , mental imbalance and heart attack.   3.47706996211263
Many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection.   3.398141643270847
If you are infected and pregnant , then you can even lose the child.   4.199842017478802
For safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also.   2.149629419481426
Get the infection checked at regular intervals.   2.4574054562434764
If the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done.   3.6857497857176815
With the help of injection one can control it within 24 hours.   2.713729996724664
Tykomonosis infection spreads through a parasite.   1.9565602871206822
The main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women.   3.879478673771979
Apart from this , itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also a common symptom.   3.628062231234716
There are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men.   4.17728818280541
But many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis.   2.678061711659046
Pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly.   2.244548583811886
According to Dr Preeti maximum STD are bacterial.   2.877210072401908
For safety against STD , If together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased.   2.885676651913105
Health and regular check up -.   2.4079106034852775
Generally most of the women do not get regular checkups , because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards.   4.538706084231881
Generally , in girls , pap starts occurring after the age of 15 years.   1.9996605636598932
The white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap.   2.8214176314910366
It is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of 12 years.   3.813824723154344
The pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of 40 years.   2.280262254620633
But still , on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of 30 years.   2.515515414800357
Pap test is of two types.   1.7810127397159001
Leukoria test is done to find about common infections.   2.8457136910004683
Leukoria test completely depends on physical relations.   1.9262512996383758
Those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex , they do not need the leukoria test a great deal.   3.426302380307325
Pap infection test is also of two types.   2.532105827516043
One , which is a simple test , with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled.   3.095502520103688
Second , ` hyper plasia ' is the second important test for pap infection.   2.200782615211689
With ` hyper plasia ' pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not.   3.240065890708631
The doctors generally advise for ` hyper plasia ' test to women of 40 years.   2.751430752471101
The homeopathic doctor Minu Mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of 30 years.   2.2859662869634776
Though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer.   2.8968172185666545
Liquid pap test is done for this.   2.4950038582169185
Breast cancer is engulfing Indian women very fast.   2.21261684680263
According to a recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal , ignore it.   3.4759031128472824
According to Dr Pankaj Kumar of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital , women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up.   2.942897129352179
Women of 20-29 years should get mammography done once every third year.   2.9018758054268674
Not just this , together with this one should also do BSF or breast self exam.   3.5374104095951626
Breast Self Exam should be started right after the age of 20 years.   2.0301608584632502
Normally , doing BSF may keep you vigilant for breast cancer , but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node , unwanted pain or any type of secretion.   2.952710335255685
The hormonal changes start happening after the age of 30 years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is a persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it.   4.1916506489545915
Thus , getting ultrasound done every year is very important.   2.280865399992838
The treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this , on being diagnosed at the right time.   3.4796789339329455
After an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done.   3.2075758497547673
With the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test.   3.2019910366907207
After its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not.   2.3972922944444535
Though biopsy test is a part of your regular checkups , but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes , pain in the lower abdomen , sudden growth of hair on face , increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done.   3.3661278003166952
Often after crossing 40 women stop paying attention towards their health.   2.0453608106280807
They feel that now they do not need any regular checkups , but this is not proper.   3.5031073368548613
There are many such diseases after 40 which may take awful shape on not taking precaution.   2.9904862677659367
The FSH test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started.   2.9544959236665287
In FSH test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause.   3.216355439849521
Pelvic exam test must be done annually.   2.0466859215520032
With the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus , reproductive organs , bladder etc can become known.   2.9542038701006432
If any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test.   3.8742263187573607
One 's cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining 45 years.   2.2846613144233414
If you are less than 45 years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done.   3.4800913946525958
Not just this , if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after 40.   4.7143432256682045
Maximum women in India give birth to children till the age of 30-35 years.   2.5335221808113197
After delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity.   3.655697559417143
Because of this a lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs.   4.772249090064096
Although 60 years is the age for the test of osteoporosis , but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery.   3.0446518338185635
Bone densitometry is also done for calcium.   2.4269945534250303
By the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out.   3.79613535529068
After the age of 45 years the danger of colon cancer increases in women.   3.9300753677934903
Although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in India , but still regular checkups is important.   3.7359629383191213
Every year FOBT test should be done for colon cancer.   3.2922800800708814
Sample of human fecus is taken in FOBT test.   2.1959463706862166
After the FOBT test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc.is coming in your stomach or not.   3.209361369922793
Flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years.   2.011404212526077
By flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver , stomach or reproductive organs.   2.9967115637957575
Colonoscopy must be done once every 10 years.   2.1538481028109704
That is , one at 40 then second at 50 years of age.   2.789763255575728
There are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval.   3.8290246231301346
These tests are - blood pressure , diabetes , depression and obesity fatness.   2.4884246468421845
Poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes.   2.902401915600935
If the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases 8 times.   4.592909446628236
Because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled.   3.956683823058984
If you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of 120 increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast.   3.6403367324334455
It also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need.   3.7553162932795328
If in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted , without getting broken ?.   2.716122403226878
Many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette , chewing tobacco , obesity , eating excessive salt , mental disturbance , deficiency of physical labor , the elasticity of the vessels decrease , it starts contracting.   3.1629031675980688
This only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become a common disease today.   3.9969928145126916
Nature has created our vessels only for bearing a certain pressure.   2.363123836085013
If the pressure on them is constantly very high then it would have a bad effect on their walls.   4.0946248175979765
As a result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end : brain , heart and kidneys.   3.7921805987956096
But it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high.   3.7791963040633987
Otherwise , first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure.   3.7010428311102235
If you take two simple roller pumps in place of the two halves of the heart auricle and ventricle then you can do the entire task of the heart.   4.221243097821545
Impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body.   2.9229374401996266
Both the main arteries open in the right auricle.   3.4758346736886954
If we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing.   3.648235338301586
One tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries.   2.7240797309606624
In short , the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty.   4.459753396022188
Medical surgery does this only.   1.7268334956574722
If we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead.   3.377978460596363
Blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification.   2.4791709990544026
Artificial lungs are also a very simple apparatus.   3.359123331897271
A glass vessel full of blood in which oxygen is released in the form of bubbles.   3.8178155080081724
There is a special arrangement so that lather do not form by the bubbles of oxygen.   3.1928051203640444
Without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going.   3.378237643042027
Heart - lung-machine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only , by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible.   2.8922744015779744
The heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body.   2.8699192947232306
The heart too needs fuel for its work.   2.678555280387826
The heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers.   3.1126995725137783
Close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches.   3.3615015553889354
Coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart.   2.0387839094401925
The meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like a crown on the heart.   2.6334625507372684
The amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with a crown.   4.640922763560898
On the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack.   3.4059875490777975
The collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs , getting reflected and taking a photograph of this is only called ultrasonography.   2.5429835464155475
These days there is discussion about ultrasonography.   2.234256169742047
But the knowledge about the technique of USG started right from the beginning of this century.   3.8984842265248196
It was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released.   3.410617664492451
Which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of USG.   2.7366451892024193
In this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for a moment and then catches the reflected rays back.   2.8637421996321897
Instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate.   2.67760437354398
With its help proper treatment is done by doing medical cure.   2.999567486356643
The popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of USG is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother.   4.136800485546631
But it is not like that.   2.4310143149221375
Stomach is like a closed pouch , inside which gall bladder , liver , intestines , kidneys , lymph glands , spleen etc are situated.   2.632782794096582
Similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated.   3.1370208124146433
For the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special USG is important.   3.5229306145064183
Normal or special USG save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery.   2.4273339789307715
Liver is a very important organ of the body.   2.6086637415382383
The more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them.   2.810849416948794
The infections of liver , cyst , normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer , the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound.   3.004178958447544
Similarly , if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer , then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound.   2.8905722199292265
The kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart.   4.49256879670886
Because of the life-long working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive.   3.6770769325866524
Whether there is kidney or not , if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst , stone , swelling , pus , this also is told to us by the ultrasound test.   3.3698411970240647
Till some time ago in order to find this , X-ray was taken by injecting dye in blood , which used to take a lot of time and it was also painful.   3.9331566189367417
The problem of thyroid gland is also very common.   4.020440789790228
For the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is a less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity.   3.453607227707369
The diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid , prostate , adrenal etc is possible through USG.   3.519142777485607
One very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer.   3.2382885239598975
It is believed that U.S.G.mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular X-ray mammography.   3.0933910594244844
It gives cure in 75-90 % cases.   2.4310640293600208
USG mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity.   2.45308610372943
The extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere.   3.2692024672357616
Whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not , whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing , all these are found from the USG test of the uterus.   3.6687929688355903
Many serious complications are found in the foetus like the non-formation of the head or even the water getting filled in it hydrocephalous etc..   3.4539643580873975
Ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems.   2.0752243830907604
Apart from the correct information about the foetus , one more important information which found through USG is in the matter of placenta.   3.6649152662563647
The properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta.   2.9301646745639283
By ultrasound all the deformities can be detected , the status of the placenta , any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc..   3.274309259699194
By which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus.   3.150066792136416
By USG that is , ultrasonography a lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine.   3.769654479763496
Very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs.   2.1773028063440103
So important , simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for a hideous work.   2.210253273911568
Every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus.   2.8984827311942425
In some form or the other we participate in the pre-delivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons.   3.4429341829039366
Because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight.   3.1485130892292235
Cataract disease is connected to age and often this makes the people who are more than 50 years of age as its victims.   3.9268718212369618
On getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be a congenital disease or a disease occurring after a year of birth.   4.216844967841574
The rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries.   4.23859260409784
According to the Blind Control in India there are 1,20,00,000 blind people in the country out of which 80 % people are victims of cataract.   4.39833146270761
Though this blindness can be rectified through surgery.   2.131248509419191
The natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases.   3.105904501087419
This is called white cataract.   3.472762446413615
In the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles.   4.1140036443021115
After a condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles.   3.351666402743087
At present the only permanent solution for this is surgery.   3.0582744372721375
To make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable a very new technique has been developed which is called ` phaco emulsification ' technique.   3.828775660420579
To take out the cataract with the help of the technique of ` phaco emulsification ' a small incision of 3 mm is made.   3.085345148039123
Through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye.   3.095579530430348
Now through this small incision a foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye.   3.0835343664063934
Since this incision is very small , therefore there is no need to put suture to this.   3.0608278083928524
Thus , it is called the suture less surgery.   2.896365001329258
The special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after a day.   4.11935868741053
He is finally given the number of spectacles after a week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months.   3.614248907301845
The surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care.   2.6502113745880997
To do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes , both hands and both legs.   3.078271839050652
One leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes.   2.3538361071644593
One hand handles the needle of phaco machine , the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument.   2.7469351857933586
Expensive machines are used in the technique of phaco emulsification.   3.2308856641832273
Therefore , ` phaco emulsification ' technique is costlier than normal surgeries.   1.9307581615805194
Phaco machine is proving to be a boon for the patients of cataract.   3.2078600893831424
The surgery done by phaco machine is easy , painless and can be done in less time.   3.435107039139463
You can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part.   4.064523454127707
Especially , such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus.   2.968829791116123
More than 50 lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number.   3.5554962128221574
Till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that.   2.7465392140832043
But now a technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery.   3.921766903092375
The technique of lithoptysis was used in 1980 for the first time and from 1987 it has become available in India as well.   3.2005254834502894
In the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves.   3.5853522353480036
The pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine.   2.35406672691907
Today it has gained credibility as the most safe , simple and theoretical procedure.   2.2657163467256254
If the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is a need of some common blood and urine tests , X-rays of the kidneys and IBP X-ray.   4.582073004206015
Generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process.   2.8540263822072274
The action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by a sleep inducing injection.   2.4637907218349944
The time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number.   3.3448142850660663
Generally this is done in one episode.   3.3411927293474037
One episode in this is of 30-40 minutes and a gap of 4 days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body.   2.935657438613586
When these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced.   3.0717735778990822
Some patients may be feeling slight piercing , but there is no pain.   2.838397792471961
Most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment.   3.5066536686091623
As an exception , one may have to be put under vigilance for 24 hours.   2.5879315060783057
Post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after 3 months.   3.141007307544784
Then by taking a new X-ray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not.   3.626046969177432
Since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been 8-10 years , information about its long term effects have not been gathered.   2.8978347941338742
Of course , in complications immediately after treatment bleeding in urine and feeling of intense pain in 1-2 micturition are included.   2.852618953993427
Approximately 90 % of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis.   3.1026919687792156
In some the action may have to be repeated twice or more.   3.745708646419224
The expense at every sitting amounts to nearly 8 thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor.   2.3690952713981597
Presently , this facility is available in 30-35 cities in our country.   2.347006970808637
In lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision.   2.6827087331368893
You can start the normal daily life in a week.   3.502510191944952
The action can be repeated if the stone forms again.   2.4978553055423642
The technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged , patients of diabetes , blood pressure or heart disease.   3.3077433968929295
The problem of uncontrolled micturition -.   2.6987927470614763
in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening.   2.6958813215353548
The tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small.   3.2787546197185207
Babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine.   3.7045458954919845
Maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only.   3.6065241121545326
They stop wetting clothes and bed.   1.7868525884938873
Not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women.   2.7079599640318657
It has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be 5 to 7 % in the age group of 15-44 years , 8 to 15 % in age group of 45-64 years of age and 16 to 20 % in women of 65 years and more.   4.1099434340353245
The complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women.   2.2691046579482155
Permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment.   3.0407428266694385
The complication of not having control on urination , the problem of leaking on its own may occur due to the reason of diseases of urinary system or the various diseases of organs situated close to it.   3.7628471738279736
Urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder , urinary system , when there is tension due to coughing , sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes.   3.0775482957878477
The most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage.   4.467791871934747
If the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled.   3.96054880598347
This problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder.   4.688607372197004
But in several women its cause is not diagnosed.   2.949381586436612
This problem may occur in some due to mental tension.   3.1138000623334467
Women often try to control urine for long time.   2.0917861525322836
The urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less.   3.0759424899359513
Clothes may also be spoiled by not having control due to some structural defects in urinary bladder  urinary tract.   3.6379785215363323
If from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum fistula or genitals then also the problem may arise.   3.535000213217288
There is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex , long stuck delivery.   3.9859142080367844
Though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret , but the treatment of this problem is possible.   4.233930495992883
The doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests.   2.8999424092820454
To find out the reasons , the help of tests like the test of urine , bed rest , measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder , the speed of the flow of urine , the pressure of the leakage of urine , ultrasound , x-ray , CT scan etc is taken.   3.6248691027043005
The solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause.   3.9004745210689533
If the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast.   4.4160079256713125
If there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery.   2.7406868021498574
If there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it.   4.462817291382704
If the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved.   4.186413572659251
If the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques , medicine and surgery.   3.7280048010610543
If not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water , liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity.   4.105515909505228
Do not consume tea , coffee , carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it.   3.757577557503483
Reduce the weight if the weight is excessive.   3.085978966279387
If infested with any type of allergy , cough , constipation then get the treatment done.   2.7992873072304643
Do exercise of pelvis and stomach.   2.1933707698027316
Mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination.   2.840708377233614
Tension , worry are lethal for the physical and mental health.   2.1147166645968856
Stay away from these as much as possible , live life happily , free of tension and worry.   2.9065774809085902
In these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure , coughing , sneezing.   3.385529331576416
If relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis.   3.627066668062025
Various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients.   3.0956357365885614
If these increases the will power in patients then also relief may be got from the problems.   3.0626864357978096
These patients get relief in 80 % by using the instrument placed close to the genitals by which the lower part of the urinary bladder gets support.   3.949822327550625
Similarly , plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube.   3.3923468896256144
If relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery.   2.4990831472682986
Because of not having control over urination in the state of hyperactivity of urinary bladder , women stay in haste , their urine can leak.   3.3300446659531038
This is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination.   3.0974343242205675
If this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then a proper treatment of disease is essential.   5.077286555648791
If the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination.   3.5664028275672908
Stop urine for a definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to 3-4 hours gradually , do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it.   2.8880311093005853
Control on urine is done through the medium of brain , spinal cord and nerves.   3.2440939778355418
If the will power is made strong , the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that I am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained.   3.8180118295873444
Around 85 % also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves.   2.97538446787394

If the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting a tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery.   3.5552250024199417
Unable to keep control on urination , self leaking , feeling hasty , is a common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this.   3.764372854595933

This discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place , drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly.   1.978438045884659
The complaint of urine infection can occur both in men and women but this complaint is found more in women because the inner part of their genitals stays open.   3.6651805794513708

Those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once.   2.7780822435722565
When the menstruation stops after the age of 50-52.   3.9842564034223122
After the age of 50-52 the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this , then the chance of infection increases very much.   3.7318805194946894
The distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort.   2.952587322331084
In urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation.   2.9601976773161343
The stream of urine being distorted and not straight , intense burning sensation around the place of urine , onset of fever.   2.5794658151671412
In the condition of less urination the doctor puts a urinary bladder and tube.   3.9328739710655105
The reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of E.Coli bacteria.   3.4840185265486703
The occurrence of urinary infection in females may be a common thing but it is quite shameful and uncomfortable.   4.302048335998479
Not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract , wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible.   2.8687486482394404

The cancer of skin is generally of three types.   2.7796997414823865
Squamous cell cancer , basal cell cancer , melanin cell cancer.   1.8676187175549768
The melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above.   3.4622459590756893
While basal cell cancer is the least dangerous.   2.0824481222811975
The cancer of skin generally appears in the form of a small tumor.   2.458966306106516
This tumor can appear on any part of the body.   2.1439404236703234
Like hand , leg , face etc..   1.549296266173945
The tumor can be of normal color or of black color.   2.485725737946635
In the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake , because there is no pain in the tumor.   3.983728781079831
Therefore , the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor.   4.794994610073866
When the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer.   4.613607109262707
Which has spread in other parts of the body as well.   2.339484341685113
At times cancer appears in the form of a small wound.   2.665776010227197
The problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain.   3.680359592800704
The patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain.   4.409737043824765
The cancer of the wound increases and a stage comes when pain starts occurring in that.   2.7979035288224003
But by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body.   2.2233254741268644
At times cancer appears in hairless tumors.   2.2194890971478087
Therefore , do not forget any tumor.   2.4502082317907266
No matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors , this is not known.   3.904831881829193
Still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms.   2.576125631521948
Formation of wound in the tumor , rapid growth of tumor , pain in the tumor , change of color in the tumor.   4.1111986947710095
If any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor.   2.782292171306054
Cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels : the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful.   3.106510019051524
Because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body.   2.686189171247342
Definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin.   1.9969207935646407
If a tumor persists for years then in the situation of the growth of the tumor , getting tested is a must.   4.080984275460233
If pain starts happening in the tumor of the skin then get cautious and definitely get the test for cancer done.   3.9723661178270357
If wound appears in tumor then also getting attentive is important.   2.1954962860730936
Each such wound appearing on the skin , which does not get healed in 2 weeks , signals towards cancer.   3.1199106505404393
Generally , the cancer of skin spreads through lump vessels alone.   2.294720547842653
Therefore , generally the cancer of skin spreads very slowly indeed.   2.2871924734089895
The skin of the place which has cancer , from there it goes to the nearby lymph gland and from there it then goes to central lymph glands.   3.471619194919947
Treatment of the cancer of the skin : along with the cancerous skin the healthy skin is also cut and removed.   4.144932053356883
By which the danger of cancer being left back is removed.   2.9589507870829035
At times , along with the cancer infested skin the lymph glands are also cut and removed.   3.5267247040557916
It depends on the rapidity of the cancer whether cancerous gland has to be removed or not.   2.9281824708187747
Carelessness should not be towards long persisting wound , towards warts and painless tumor , towards genitals.   2.7405666623297624
The cancer of the skin of the genitals is different from the cancer of the skin of the other organs.   3.6903816987063407
Although the beginning of cancer starts just with a tiny tumor or wound , but the tumors and wound stay hidden beneath the skin of the genitals and by the time it is diagnosed it becomes very late.   3.400327873187031
At times this delay is also due to the hesitation in talking about the matters of genitals.   3.5336525202096216
Not only cancer but other diseases of genitals also continues to grow due to hesitation and its proper treatment does not take place.   3.221644763122005
In the condition of cancer of female genitals : the skin of the genitals are cut and removed.   3.842620310110715
If the cancer has spread up to the lymph glands then the lymph glands also have to be cut and removed.   3.5626455076314247

The main aim of the family planning program was to reduce birth rate right from the beginning in order to achieve this aim , for which the various techniques of family planning was to be encouraged in the masses.   3.394499022760745
The meaning of birth and child health point of view is to accept unanimous and composite view towards the issues of contraception and mother-child health.   3.3035657482457657
Solid methods to control population growth -.   1.9202070517755183
Population growth has been the chief problem of the developing countries.   2.929912170390088
In order to stop population growth immediately very solid steps have to be take.   3.21092463716396
Firstly , it is needed to attack poverty.   2.278602871550544
Appropriate success can not be achieved in this direction without removing this factor mainly responsible for population increase in countries like India.   2.930889176639427
The nation looks infested with scarcity from all the four sides.   1.9923737568501445
Baldness is not a disease.   2.0870565757977153
At present there has been a flood of the centres for treating baldness in big cities.   2.9455875200975123
Generally , hair starts falling due to high fever , typhoid , syphilis , influenza and lack of blood etc..   2.994469540363464
Generally baldness is a genetic condition but it begins mostly in the head with the start of itching and irritation.   3.0017607908785795
It has often been seen that the hair of 20-30 year old men falls gradually and after some time they become bald to a great extent.   3.5316304754809926
Therefore it can be prevented in the beginning with safety measures.   4.515116394767287
It happens very fast in women of less age but the situation of complete baldness arises very less in them.   3.9124984708410757
This is a scientific fact that the hair of healthy people grow everyday and in the place of hair that fall during combing new hair grow on their own from time to time.   3.754218324011094
Various skin diseases like herpes , ringworm make such a layer on the scalp that the hair starts falling and baldness comes.   2.9994986348346093
The use of cosmetics like oils to prevent hair fall and baldness , the soaps to wash head make such cases even more serious.   2.8081630987666433
Staying in intense light or staying in sunlight for long , special types of beautifying cosmetics and techniques like bleaching and curling of the hair etc.encourage baldness.   2.7261316287716295
Special hair designs in which the hair is twisted and broken and making pony tail especially while sleeping at night and by putting needles and rings in the hair etc may also become the reason of baldness.   3.407512818047301
Because of deficiency of thyroid the hair start falling by becoming thin , weak and dry.   3.611300494051678
Along with keeping the body healthy with nutritious food the hair can also be made beautiful dense and strong.   4.3108962994611035
Unbalanced diet not just stops the continuous growth of hair but it also makes bald very fast.   2.9539070115405854
Because of any ups and downs happening in the life hair start falling and complete baldness may also come.   3.718367053361919
During pregnancy and after pregnancy the falling of hair in women is a common thing.   4.229172669304138
Tiredness and tension are the chief causes of heart disease so it also has a large impact on body and hair.   3.7078867577988306
Some professions also do not stay away from affecting the hair.   3.262040839456639
The hair of a thirty year old man in England was found to come out in bunches while his hew hair were also growing.   2.9165058773818093
After the chemical tests it was found that the quantity of mercury was more in his blood vessels because of which his hair used to fall.   4.295074207499526
It was found after enquiring that mercury was used in the industry in which he was working because of which the mercury slowly diffused into his body gradually.   3.3158019296668466
Because of eating habits the hair often falls.   3.967330775928127
Because of excessive feelings and being emotional disorders occur in the head and it is natural for the hair to fall.   5.001231243200054
Increase of weight or obesity is a chief health problem.   2.92695573713219
Most men-women , be it adults or youth , are tensed with the increasing obesity or increase in weight of their body.   3.014814842775222
If the increase in weight and obesity becomes a hindrance for the activities of the body then actually it becomes a matter of concern for every person.   4.389933100041288
Normally , the main symptom of obesity is that the height of the body should be in proportion to the weight of the body.   4.0994192531492715
If the weight is more than the physical height then the body is fat otherwise the body comes in the category of being thin.   4.146974396834177
Two main reasons of weight and obesity have been told under the health science.   3.0036012852426324
First , genetic meaning by descent.   1.587432579874103
Second , because of food habits meaning activities related to diet.   2.430012272123182
Eating more than hunger , not doing exercise or physical labor , leading a life of lethargic etc.come under this.   2.7928991874724503
People who do not do physical labor and exercise , along with the less flow of blood in their body , in places like belly , hips and waist.   4.28735614763823
Cholesterol fat accumulates in the blood carrying vessels as a result of which diseases like high blood pressure , indigestion , heart disease and diabetes occur.   3.9441034181622032
At present as the consciousness of people are increasing towards healthy life and pure and plain healthy diet and exercise people are becoming aware of the dangers owing to increase in weight and obesity.   3.3275330477198115
The diseases owing to obesity are also becoming a subject of concern for people.   2.7429341716881592
Advice of reducing weight and obesity is given by the doctors to the patients of high blood pressure , diabetes and heart disease.   3.1146477469242893
The women escape from food which increase weight and obesity and practice self control in order to keep their body slim and attractive.   3.3309363436846544
It is generally seen that in order to reduce the weight of the body and not to let obesity come the lasses take very less food under dieting and do unnecessary exercise.   4.250166969252927
By doing unnecessary exercise several times harmful effects are seen on the body.   3.3979243986105696
The other problem which comes by this is that if the weight of the body is more or less than required then along with ill effects on health weakness may also arise in the body.   3.8170163750120882
In the report released by World Health Organisation , it was indicated in 2002 that among the ten chief dangers for health the biggest danger is that of the reduced weight.   3.6201551793816726
If the weight of the body reduces without dieting or without exercise then this also is considered to be the symptom of a serious disease.   3.979071428054258
It is important to take the advice of the doctor prior to dieting.   3.1795826217468734
It is essential for the body to get complete nutrition according to the daily needs because of which it can work well and there should not be any weakness.   4.633481485562862
The following matters have to be paid attention to in this context.   3.4046410598270036
The harmony between food and habits is a must then only the effort towards the direction of reducing weight  obesity becomes meaningful.   2.907385224711793
The body construction and the food related needs of every human being is different according to his actions.   3.2137189624796187
Copying someone or comparing oneself with the other is waste.   2.4956717296453466
Some food items like fast  junk food , fried substances come under the food of negative calorie.   2.855079781397398
The hunger does get satiated by eating food items like fast  junk food.   2.2518386107161055
But the body does not get any benefit from this.   3.0760161934973587
Gradually one should try to evade it by strong will power.   2.2693898935833268
Dieting is done by several girls and women to reduce their obesity and weight.   3.0687315768287893
Positive results of reducing obesity come forward.   2.1065815125417315
The person who is dieting should diet after taking proper consultation.   2.6001391477922486
There are many dangerous diseases in the present world - TB , Malaria , disease of heart , Cancer , Tension and HIV etc..   3.792479228498269
These diseases are more dangerous than SARS , These diseases have caused the death of more people in comparison to SARS.   3.5590883598295204
Then also SARS has attracted the attention of more and more people.   2.5253645238886904
There are many similarities and difficulties in SARS and other diseases.   2.5710322861957264
It is important here that SARS has emerged as a new problem , this is a new disease which is non-curable.   4.202984969666209
SARS is spreading due to infection.   2.084026651448207
SARS today is the synonym of that disease which occurs due to corona virus.   3.137543819987861
Because of SARS disease the infected person gets high 104 degree Fahrenheit fever.   3.622435719064549
Dry cough starts coming and there is difficulty in breathing.   2.6496798851399466
SARS is called hyper active respiratory syndrome.   1.9734564338435032
The initial symptoms of SARS resemble pneumonia.   2.1345359634239256
But if SARS is not diagnosed in time or there is carelessness in treatment then death takes place.   3.316832352881537
The history of SARS is not very old.   2.1610223204683896
The recognition of the disease was done for the first time in China.   3.6688929010193685
The first patient was discovered in aeroplane on February 26 , 2003.   2.3667210499777687
The symptoms of the patient infected with SARS are illusionary.   3.3449762142787574
The infected person gets fever of 104 degree Fahrenheit or more and he also feels cold with this.   2.9272838521684896
Headache and vomiting starts happening.   2.566433382407403
Breathing becomes difficult in the patient.   2.480529400977098
The symptoms like pneumonia appear.   2.963118979102953
The one who is attacked dies in three - six days.   2.258671383064445
In the whole world there is a situation of illusion regarding the patients and the symptoms of SARS.   6.367885384407641
Thus , Suspect Case and Probable Case have been defined.   1.947652419689959
The formula to stay constantly healthy.   1.791782856346237
Uncountable types of bacteria and virus are spread in our atmosphere.   2.3359607363355965
By the medium of our breath we pull in thousands of bacteria and virus with the air into our body and then also they do not have any ill effect on our body.   3.8197808512900577
At times when our immune system falls weak due to some reason then only we become infested with flu or cough-cold or any other disease or allergy.   3.3581015871915088
With food also we make several disease bearer microbes reach our body.   2.1598273164520436
Such microbes mostly die when coming in contact with the saliva of our mouth or else the acid of our stomach.   2.9777554269216253
If by any reason this does not happen in the body of any person then he is troubled by the poisoning of the food.   3.772779926618963
After all why does it happen that in similar situations some people fall sick while some other people continue to be healthy.   2.8724281573719113
How does the immune system work ?.   2.644497302823213
At first the body protects us from the external disease causing agents.   2.6680533497763452
A type of antibacterial substance continues to be produced on our skin by coming in contact of which there is destruction of various types of disease causing bacteria and microbes.   4.268082633037195
The nature protects us by other means as well.   2.3719777510581928
Our mouth , nose and eyes also become the way of entry into the body for the microbes.   3.793761511941639
The saliva in the mouth is antibacterial.   2.8758481221254106
A layer of mucous is spread over the nasal cavity and the lungs.   2.5875593153350236
The microbes which do not die immediately , they become inactive on sticking with the mucous.   2.7191014809494716
There is a type of enzyme in the mucous and the tear that flows from our eyes which is called ` lysosome '.   4.088641952606133
Lysosome by breaking the wall of the cell destroys the disease causing bacteria.   2.742282957446605
The beneficial bacteria named ` lactobacillus ' staying in the intestines and genitals saves us from yeast and the other harmful microbes.   3.1133916940335293
This way our immunity works as a protective shield against the mischief of just any disease causing microbe.   3.0361595788595124
If by any reason any antigen like the disease causing bacteria , virus , fungus , parasite or any other external substance enter in the body by penetrating the upper protective shield then the immunity action of cells and humoral begins.   3.2417491471487234
The scientists believe that apart from the other parts there are three different types of cells and three other soluble proteins in the immunity system.   4.096987791374406
The cells and proteins can be seen in the blood flowing in our body.   3.5655149986064902
The cells and proteins together become capable of initiating the immunity activity.   2.124913703702451
There are three main types of cells - red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes , white blood corpuscles or leukocytes and platelets or thrombocytes that is , the cells which coagulate the blood.   3.118901327802055
Worm - this is a common disease in children.   3.322088108494315
Objectively the worms are of several types - round worm , magnetic worm , thread worm , tape worm and other diseases of worm.   2.7882714141177294
Round worm affects children the most.   1.748113081083633
The symptoms of round worm.   2.9484496695315023
Less hunger , stomach pain , mild fever , chattering of teeth , micturition in bed , cough , itching in anus and many other abnormal symptoms are of worms.   2.807800613363467
At times the round worms come together as a unit and produce obstruction in the intestines.   2.7724590974864474
Because of round worm there may be pain in the stomach and vomiting.   5.402742821412947
The hook worms get stuck to the intestine and they reduce blood there by sucking it from there.   2.7738980569050256
The eggs of round worm reach the intestines through polluted food and blood.   2.5260041686682397
The round worm become the cause of several symptoms after maturing.   2.5251046435810625
The eggs of hook worms hatch on warm and wet ground and their embryos reach the thin blood vessels by penetrating the bare feet of human body.   2.4315113400313217
Tape worm reaches the body by eating contaminated meat.   2.814634616369272
Their diagnosis is possible by stool examination.   2.1660120885513203
Similarly , naru is also a type of contagious disease which occurs by drinking unclean water of ponds , lakes , tanks etc..   3.1115804849793074
The water in rural areas is generally available from these sources only.   2.957608980663544
Thus , naru disease is generally found more in rural population.   2.670692764373326
The naru worms reach the digestive system by drinking contaminated water where the naru worms come out of the Cyclopes and enter the tissues of the skin and begin to grow.   3.3969337809244635
The worm generally produces a wart in that part of the body which often comes in contact with water.   3.5370827372537823
In such situation the naru worm releases its larva in the water.   2.6891656800788497
The symptoms occurring due to naru worms are generally seen in the lower part of the body.   3.462038118430273
The part of the body where the worms come out , there is intense itching and then inflammation occurs and then a hole forms.   3.38209107407266
Because of this the symptoms of high fever , headache and vomiting appear.   5.206037716000867
In order to prevent naru disease the water of tanks , lakes and ponds etc should be used only after filtering.   3.7232915883546505
The diagnosis of naru disease can also be done by putting some chemical injections in bone marrow.   3.2885914109189462
The disease which spread through the microbes related to water -.   2.922249711997229
In this disease several types of malaria , filaria , dengue and yellow fever etc.are included.   3.4022498034825728
The disease of malaria spreads from one person to the other through a total of four sub species of mosquitoes named plasmodium falciparum , plasmodium vivax , plasmodium ovale and plasmodium malaria.   2.675517943862264
In the symptoms of malaria there is high fever , nausea , headache and very profuse sweating.   4.001108087681021
By affecting the pancreas and nervous system malaria becomes the reason of loss of consciousness and at times death.   3.0494499335249734
Generally the mosquitoes bite at night.   2.2351949941958904
The disease of filaria spreads because of the bite of mosquitoes named culecs pipians at night.   3.4067807376409247
Dengue , yellow fever and other microbial infection spreads through another sub species of mosquito named andes egyptys.   2.36287424166177
Aedes Aegypti mosquito spreads yellow fever mainly in the urban regions by communicating virus from one person to the body of another person.   2.918400730553762
In the chemical composing of water the roles of nitrate , fluoride and arsenic are very important in the ascertainment of the suitability of the drinking water.   3.2769386397195532
But its high density may lead to the growth of various lethal diseases in the ling run.   3.188167807648177
Or it enters our body through the medium of water and then it gets converted to nitrite.   3.5857904018299678
This nitrite again reacts with diamine , amide and carbonate and forms n-nitroso compound which is very cancerous.   2.1528051977772438
For the ascertainment of the suitability of fluoride rich drinks the role of fluoride is also very important.   3.52764082596136
On consumption of long term or excessive fluoride rich water , many types of disease occur in man and cattle.   2.9009734980589204
The disease occurring due to the excessiveness of fluoride is called ` fluorosis '.   3.797398829516182
Polio eradication program : problem and solution.   1.8028966670827038
Polio is such a disease which is not lethal but by making the people handicapped it makes them abnormal for the entire life.   3.8141536508626115
In this disease affecting in childhood generally , the growth of legs stop and they are left small and thin.   4.023454769968334
Consequently polio infested person has to walk as a lame person or with the help of crutches for the whole life.   2.826847413825429
Often the patients of polio become fat when the age increases because of which their problems increase even further.   4.0637783142084585
The reason of polio disease is polio mellitus virus.   3.157623757117118
In order to free India from polio mellitus virus and to save people from becoming victims of polio in thousands of number every year , the pulse polio program was started by the World Health Organisation which was established in April 7 1948.   3.3261919196826946
The pulse polio program was started on an experimental basis for the first time in Delhi in 1994-95.   2.6353483735060634
Being encouraged of the reach of pulse polio and the support received to the pulse polio in Delhi this program was executed in the whole country in 1995-96.   3.2106842205771717
Till now there have been several rounds of pulse polio program in the whole country.   3.1097617760713674
The main aim of pulse polio has been only this that no child should be left devoid of taking polio vaccine in hilly places , desert places , forest areas or in any far distanced places.   3.2493726710714412
The pulse polio program will continue for three more years now.   2.3968663210084347
Average perplexity: 17.5307580665028
