Chicken pox varicella.
Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster VZV.
It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox.
In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby.
Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i.e.till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started.
Most of the people become victim of chicken pox one time or the other in their childhood or adolescence.

Disease of heart and blood vessels : The main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack , paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur.
Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes.
Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this.
Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle.
The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests.

Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR.
The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective.
Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life.

Days back a surprising report taking up mental problems was published in a national level newspaper.
This matter can not be completely true but to consider it a guess will also not be correct.
In order to search luxury and comfort man may be making progress by leaps and bounds but his brain has to bear a lot of harms for this.
Even though not all might be taking the advice of psychiatrists or psychologists.
But the number of patients coming to the psychiatrist and psychologists today has increased much than earlier.
In the pomp of multimillion advertisements of modern medical science perhaps very few people will accept the truth that methods of effective treatment of common mental problems and severe psychological disorders are present in the ancient Indian medical science , that is , Ayurveda.
The Nij disorders are those which occur due to the imbalance of tridisorders gas , bile , cough.
In Ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy.
The meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body.
If the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected.
Healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body.
There are three properties of man - saatvik , rajasik and tamasik , these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it.
According to few specialists , the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire , pride and intelligence.
Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all.
With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders.
According to Dr.Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body.
Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders.
One main cause for occurrence of mental disorders for any person is also not being able to strike a proper balance with his surroundings.
In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc.
If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc.
The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now.
In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain.
Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice.
After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery.
He had also heard something about hernia.
According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc.
Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur.
The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct.
After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away.
It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan.
Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach.
That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach.
The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia.
It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction.
The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common.
Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia.
If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years.
This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child.
In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth.
But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak.
Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high.
Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high.
2 to 10 percent cases of a few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type.
Excessive pressure inside the stomach is also built due to growth of hydrosil , growth of tumor in uterus , due to pregnancy , etc.because of which the walls of stomach become weak and the danger of hernia increases.
It is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia.
Swelling becomes clearly visible in some cases by staying standing for long or coughing as well.
