Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in today ’ s lecture , which is lecture number seventeen , I am going to cover or begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .   8.685538789200848
And in next lecture , I plan to talk about the other type of ionic polymerization , which is anionic chain polymerization .   19.997032623524525
Say , if I consider M as a monomer and I is a , initiation , initiator , then it could be a cation or an anion , which will , according to which we name cationic polymerization or anionic polymerization .   63.18285402412562
So , this is example , this is a case of cationic polymerization .   6.236020403561149
Now , the some polymerization , for example , initiation by coordination or semi clock side , which also progress through an ionic species , propagating , propagates through ionic species route , but those we are not going to cover as an ionic chain polymerization .   575.2239812375273
So , ionic chain polymerization we will consider only when both the initiation and the propagation reaction is by ionic species .   30.31611814739764
There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially .   459.70609240635787
However , this polymerization is ionic chain polymerization , gives us opportunity to synthesize specialized polymers , like block copolymers or tellically polymers , which are basically type polymers , having functional groups at the end of the chain , which we can , we utilized for the , for another reactions .   290.0491608817447
So , let us start the discussion on ionic polymerization and let us talk about first the general characteristics .   9.695036866631668
And while talking these general characteristics of ionic polymerization we will compare its differences or its likeliness with the chain , radical chain polymerization .   111.64509709596248
Now , why do we started our discussion on chain polymerization ?   4.0432790403435055
We talked about , that this monomers like this ether , which have electron donating group like there oxygen , which can be lone pair , can be donated if it is a cationic centre here .   148.95107634105008
Now , this type of monomers can be polymerized by cationic chain polymer , polymerization reaction because the resulting cationic propagating can be stabilized by the electron donating , mechanizing donation by the oxygen from here .   105.65466829730184
So , if I write on the , complete this sentence , in that you can able to do , stabilize both cationic and anionic propagating species .   244.41075379510826
As we see , we have seen now from this discussion , that not every monomer can be polymerized by anionically and there is a set of polymer , a set of monomers , which can be polymerized anionically .   39.895202419165976
And you know , less number of monomers can be polymerized cationically , and there are even lesser number polymers , which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization .   88.71921356470777
Now , second characteristics , if you want to talk about , is the effect of polarity , effect of polarity of the solvent .   59.053643995165615
For the positive it is a anion , for negative it is a cation .   191.1464762763281
We do ionic reaction in a polar solvent because if you have polar solvent , then this oppositely charge ions , ions will be well separated in the medium and if they are well separated , obviously , the reactivity of the active center in the propagating chain will be higher .   67.99520262150423
So , these ionic centers are destroyed with reaction of this hydroxyl , hydroxy molecules , H 2 O or alcohol .   390.77106074184945
If you have other polar solvents , like say ketone , what happens ?   30.99725724876217
This ketone loop complex form complex with this ionic species and then once they form complex , the reactivity of this ionic species are lost .   77.32553617705287
So , you require a polar solvent to have these charges separated and ions as free as possible .   245.41932967290376
Similarly , if you use very high polar solvents , like hydroxylated solvents or ketone , then the reaction actually gets stopped by reaction of these solvent molecules with the reactive species .   158.00206602717753
So , these are the examples of some of the solvents , which have , medium , low to medium polarity and does not high react with those ionic species .   87.62795258758597
Two , they can be tight ion - pair ; these are very tight , no solvent molecule in between .   60.91773554023052
Same thing is called with different names .   96.07917332326272
Now , obviously , with the increase in the polarity of the medium , if you increase the polarity of the medium , this , this , the more polar means , the ions get solvated and then finally , get as free ion , ion - pair .   54.76504586319912
So , as the reactivity of the ionic centre , obviously , the free is the ionic center it gets , it becomes more reactive .   258.9192788325582
So , in this way you can understand , that solvents play , solvent means , I mean polarity of the solvent plays a very important role in terms of reactivity of these ionic reactions .   57.34566043618794
They are fast ; they are about , say , 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 6 times of the reaction rate of radical chain polymerization .   25.467422866241684
And as we will immediately discuss , that in case of ionic reaction , this bimolecular , molecular , termination bimolecular termination by reaction between two propagating species is absent or absent because they are anionic charge .   182.3436569148621
What you have seen , that radical , two radical propagating species can react with each other and can terminate either by combination or by in case of cationic , anionic polymerization or cation polymerization .   112.8114213776038
Because they have seen this propagation species are similarly charged , they cannot react with each other and terminate the chains .   85.84906788602574
As a result , there is a huge increase in the concentration of these active centers in the medium and as a result , the reaction is very fast .   33.843152276451846
And as these ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to , very sensitive to impurities , which includes moisture because they are very active , reactive .   346.8966493915807
These ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to this impurities where you know , that radical , though radical chain polymerization are sensitive to impurities , but they are not as radical chain polymerization , is not as sensitive as in case of ionic chain polymerization and sometimes large effect of , large effect of cocatalyst .   193.7038846964417
And as the reaction is very fast and complex , this kinetic data , kinetic data are often , often not reproducible because this kinetic data is not always reproducible , especially in this case of kinetics , especially in case of cationic polymerization , cationic , the mechanism and the mechanism on kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially cationic chain polymerization is still not completely understood , to understand the mechanism in kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially the cationic one , because as I said , these reactions are very fast and not reproducible .   195.2670081431643
So , if you can stop the side reactions , which includes the chain transfer reaction , then you can actually make this chain alive or this polymerization could be living polymerization and that is especially true for anionic polymerization .   91.92877995987092
So , I should write cationic chain polymerization .   18.208551872001056
So , it consists of three steps : initiation , propagation and termination .   15.674064620386194
First , let us talk about different types of initiation reactions , different types of initiation reaction and first one is , which is more common is , by reaction of monomer with an electrophile , say R plus and this electophile could be H plus , which you get it from protonic acids .   111.39889763794835
Now , if I write generic way , H plus plus A , generic structure of a monomer , it gives you CH 3 CH Y , cationic species , and A minus .   164.44706954023428
This is counter A minus , is the counter ion .   98.73386818490799
And A minus , the counter ion , should not be heavy , strong nucleophile because if it is a very strong nucleophile , then it can react with the cationic group and make a covalent bond and stop the reaction there itself .   61.35193530350883
They are used , they can be used because this counter ions are not so strong nucleophile like halide ions , but still this , this , because they are , they are also significantly nucleophilic , this cannot built very high molecular with polymers by cationic chain polymerization .   302.5000561221831
So , that is B , with the Lewis acid I can write generic structures like MX n for Lewis acids .   265.90344616620837
Example could be BF 3 , AlCl 3 , SnCl 4 , SlCl 5 , ZnCl 2 , TiCl 4 , and so on , or they are derivatives , like RaCl 2 , R 2 AlCl and so on .   802.5126221570565
For example , if you take a reaction of isobutylene plus anhydrous BF 3 , anhydrous BF 3 , then there is no reaction .   139.74690046920045
But at the moment you add little bit of water along with this mix , so you have the same reaction with BF 3 plus H 2 O , then there is a rapid reaction .   95.14648376233862
So , these examples showing as these Lewis acids , which we just showed in the last page , they are often used along with a second catalyst or cocatalyst , which can be water molecules or some other molecules .   113.48619501075252
Now , this is called nowadays initiator because this is the species , which is supplying the H plus or R plus .   257.76603559851065
Now , I can write generic reaction for this type of reaction .   29.020407525227277
Now , once you form this , again react with the monomer and form the initiating species , which let us write in next page .   23.361241312366435
So , this is example of alkyl halide , which is used for this cocatalyst or initiator in this reaction .   100.65926977868567
So , I , I can write a generic equation or expression , say I , I for the initiator and YZ , this is for your coinitia , I for the coinitiator , this is for the initiator or this for catalyst and this is for the cocatalyst , giving rise to a cationic species and a counter ion .   191.25199128206688
This , this is the step , which is rate determining step .   11.535020009345738
For example , if I consider ionic , cationic polymerization of isobutylene by tin chloride catalyst , then the reactivity of this reaction or the rate of reaction follows Rp , follows in the order like this , nitroethane , nitroethane , phenol , water , which is basically the ranking of the acidity of this cocatalyst .   142.52537959879805
Now , this reaction complex , the , the activity , the total polymerization rate dependence on this RCl is little complex and we will keep the discussion for this course .   299.03992308195126
So , you should just remember that the , the structure of the cocatalyst also determines the rate of polymerization and also affect the rate of polymerization , and we will now see that .   63.96675864196039
Now , now Lewis , Lewis acid , we are talking about this reaction are the initiation , is by Lewis acids .   41.70733126737103
So , Lewis acidity of these defined metals increases with atomic number .   251.7169221415614
We know that Lewis acidity follow this order .   171.59038789407785
This Lewis acidity of this defined metals increases with the atomic numbers .   237.14976933073694
So , for a single metal , say , if we consider titanium , then again the Lewis acidity increases with the oxidation number .   338.13275439851526
So , TiCl 4 have more Lewis acidity compared to , Tl , TiCl 3 than this .   480.0801359124188
So , for , if you compare with defined , different metal is basically atomic number .   120.07332489887392
It will determine the Lewis acidity and for same , same metal is the oxidation state increases , the Lewis acidity increases and also the Lewis acidity .   710.1475246587732
If this ligand , they follow this , so obviously , if the ligands are fluorine or chloride , they have much more Lewis acidity compared to the ligands are , this is , this is from your basic knowledge from inorganic chemistry , basic knowledge and this is , from this expression , you know , this is strongest Lewis acid and this is , not always we use this though it is a very strong Lewis acid , for all the cationic reaction .   195.25075442591069
We will not use this as a catalyst or a coinitiator because rather than other complication if the reaction , it is too fast , then the side reactions also come in the picture , the side reaction also increases .   181.03480421491707
So , though this trend is there , now while choosing the catalyst or the coinitiator , it is , it is not this general trend is always followed , you have to keep the other factors in mind as well .   170.37835857563493
So , we talked about the initiator reaction with by this reaction of the monomers with the electrophile .   67.2667233020922
This can be initiation ; can be done by photo initiation of olium salts .   147.17078406081094
It can be done by electro initiation where cationic species is formed by electrolysis of any species present in the medium or it can be done by ionic , ionization radiation , like in the case of radical the initiation can be done by ionization .   117.83227549039361
So , these are the other possible ways of initiating a cationic polymerization .   21.71584352824902
So , we will talk about kinetic .   14.504697535686597
So , energetic , we will consider this generic initiation step and also consider this initiation step , of , for the discussion because this is the most important of the initiation step we just discussed .   119.85844920973494
Propagation , we have already seen the different types of initiation possibility and as I said , we will consider the generic case , we , as I showed there .   73.20758425602804
So , this , this was the initiation reactions .   18.86872556213363
If Y is H , the photogens we can write H M n M plus IZ minus .   26.745318280852292
For examples , that Ba 3 water case , I can write this is a proton donor .   134.9081195281446
So , I can write… This is the reaction of isobutylene catalysed by this reaction .   43.92092622125556
So , as a result more complicated products actually form when there is type of hydride shift or some cases methide shift , some cases shift one two methide shift .   698.5701055417277
But this is not common ; this is especially applicable to some monomers .   197.4942440095192
We discussed in length the effect of solvent polarity and if the polarity of the solvents is high , then this ion - pair will be more towards a solvated or free ion - pairs , then in the reactivity of this cationic species will be higher .   66.31642133855445
This is a dielectric , resulting dilating constant and this is your kp liter mole inverse second inverse .   90.67054798482297
If you consider further , 20 , 80 , 7 and this is 3.2 , 3.2 , 0 , 100 , 9.72 and this is 7 .   49.63430594485662
So , if this is the data to convince you , that if you increase the polarity , which is given by dielectric constant , the rate constant or the rate of the polymerization reaction increases .   32.61844086495794
So , we just discussed the propagation steps , now let us talk about different possible termination steps in cationic chain polymerization and as one more time , that it cannot , termination does not happen by bimolecular reaction of the propagating species and generally , the termination happens by transfer reactions .   66.32152709431126
If we consider the same examples of isobutylene polymerization by BF 3 and H 2 O , this can transfer beta proton to the monomer and can form this and plus the 2 2 beta proton , one is here and one is this hydrogen .   141.20700724678943
If this comes out , then you get a chain end with CH 2 .   51.510486172676586
If this proton goes out and if something , one of the protons goes out from there , then you get CCH and that is possible , these are possible for other monomers where this is , these two types of double bond is a possibility .   304.1403459748559
So , this is very common , this is very important termination process and it could be , this termination could happen to one of the , or any of the other agent as well .   100.98285774742872
We just gave an example with the monomer and what we will do in the next lecture , we will talk about the other termination possibilities and will discuss the kinetics and the energetics of the cationic polymerization , cationic chain polymerization and then also discuss the characteristics and other features of anionic chain polymerization .   28.67867604874033
We have discussed yesterday about the external film diffusion that is in cases where we consider nonporous matrices .   71.68079003909948
Under steady state condition , the rate of mass transfer can be equated to the rate of biochemical reaction and then by analysis one can come under two extreme conditions ; one under high substrate concentrations we get a Lineweaver Burk profile which is analogous to ordinary soluble enzyme kinetics and in the case of low substrate concentration that is in this case ; low substrate concentration and high substrate concentration you get differences in slopes and the measurement of slope at two distinct stages of Lineweaver Burk plot gives you an estimate of the value of mass transfer coefficient .   73.13996582822305
You do film diffusion klam can be computed .   368.3445478825958
Therefore based on the observed reaction velocity in the case of an immobilized enzyme reactor one can determine the value of Sb - Ss that is the substrate concentration gradient and the magnitude of this determines whether the reaction is diffusional limited or otherwise .   35.008092660800585
If the Sb - Ss is zero or very small quantity then there is no diffusional limitation .   33.626812917906555
If the magnitude is large or Sb is much , much larger than Ss in that case film diffusion is the dominant player and so the nature of Lineweaver Burk plot under the range of condition of substrate concentration can give you an idea of the mass transfer coefficient .   78.2632414270662
We are now looking at a general approach to understand the external film diffusion .   47.24979731432943
We determine by some experimental method or an analytical method or an empirical equation the magnitude of the mass transfer coefficient and the magnitude of mass transfer coefficient will give you the magnitude of the concentration gradient and so another alternative route to estimation of mass transfer coefficient has been from empirical relationship what we call as JD factor .   139.31030131223602
A JD factor has been defined in the case of heterogeneous catalysis in general and which applies very well to even enzyme catalyzed reaction .   75.241718632345
/ G ) ( µ / ?   1.0
D ) 2 / 3 This is the … .   5.337092707220734
number , Nsc .   11.199965560987469
is density , G is the superficial mass velocity and µ is the viscosity ; row is again density and D is the diffusivity .   333.92529997478636
A large number of correlations giving the values of C and n have been proposed under different conditions and one of them which needs the actual reaction conditions can be chosen from the literature and used for estimation of JD .   122.80890539828451
Because kL will be equal to kL = JD.G / ?   67.31550670913624
.Nsc 2 / 3 If you convert this magnitude of kL is related to JD factor by JD value and also a combination of the reactor operational parameters ; superficial mass velocity , density and …. .. number .   277.6456523394418
This v ’ can be considered as the observed reaction rate which has been monitored experimentally and therefore one can determine the magnitude of Sb - Ss and that determines whether the diffusional control is there or not and accordingly one can design the reactor .   103.8896788981733
One of them which have been applied is developed by McCune and Wilhelm .   357.82665870874973
Once the magnitude of kL is known then one can really incorporate the value of kL into the rate constant of a reactor performance equation .   57.146549483357234
In most of the practical cases whether it is a plug flow reactor or a CSTR , the error involved in assuming the whole reaction to be under a first order regime or a zero order regime is not very large depending on initial substrate concentration .   38.52467813263974
So a first order approximation is not something which is invalid and as I mentioned earlier if you take certain data roughly an error of about ten percent in calculation of the space velocity is encountered .   646.289430004599
It also experiences high product concentration .   29.71771733416757
But substrate concentration keeps reducing and towards the end of the reactor , the substrate concentration will be very low and one can assume a first order kinetics .   34.0763726751395
If you consider a first order case , then the reaction velocity will be v ’ = kf amSS kf I have defined here as a pseudo first order rate constant which is based on surface area ; not volumetric rate constant ; but the surface area based rate constant just to have a dimensional homogeneity with the mass transfer correlation .   214.54508862084984
If you equate the two that is v ’ = rm , that will imply that kf amSS = kLam. ( Sb - SS ) Therefore from this substrate concentration on the surface can be calculated as SS = kb.Sb / kf + kL or the observed rate is kL.kf.am.Sb v ’ = kf + kL Then the actual rate constant which incorporates the film diffusion coefficient is this parameter .   408.78092412168746
kL can be determined either from experimental data from the Lineweaver Burk plot or from empirical equation of the JD factor .   108.65083715191138
am is determined experimentally based on the geometry of the particle and kappf can be determined .   64.19768312570338
Another way again an empirical way to look at the film diffusion has been proposed by Satterfield .   175.95622915303778
I must here again point out that the whole analysis of the immobilized enzyme reactor has been largely dominated by chemical engineering literature particularly with reference to heterogeneous catalysis because the systems are very identical excepting the thermal , specificity aspects which are attributed to enzymatic reactions but the catalysis part whether it is a heterogeneous catalyst in the case of chemical engineering that means a catalyst supported on a solid matrix .   180.33808409213276
He defined a parameter Z as equal to e NRe2 / 3.NSe2 / 3 Y1 Z = ln 1.09 av Y2 Here sigma is voidage as we are familiar ; Renault number and the semite number and av is the ratio of particle surface area to reactor volume and Y1 is the mole fraction of substrate in feed ; Y2 is equal to mole fraction of substrate in the product stream and Z is the length or the height of packed bed required for mass transfer .   360.2940074453395
That means Z is the height of the length of the packed bed required to transfer the substrate concentration across the film as a function of Renault number and Semite number purely on the basis of mass transfer control ; no biochemical reaction is assumed here .   159.86055462747123
Based on the operational data that means the concentration of substrate in the feed and the product stream as well as the parameters of the reactor operation and the particle size , one can determine the length of the reactor required and if this length of the reactor required is relative to the length of the reactor required for biochemical reaction , if you compare this height required , let us say this is Z1 to that of the height required Z2 based on biochemical reaction if you calculate idealized reactor performance equation and calculate the height of the reactor required and compare the two values that gives you an identification whether film diffusion is controlling or not .   105.17029096738409
The one which is larger has to be used .   20.08823198133433
So for example let us say if this Z is much , much smaller than the height required for biochemical reaction then you don ’ t have to worry about diffusion .   21.791528495504465
This is the height of the reactor .   6.613642037301505
Right ; only Z1 ; you don ’ t bother about Z2 .   62.116025296852186
You then don ’ t have to bother about the biochemical reaction because in that height reaction would have already taken place .   91.9595675891959
Only difference is that between the bulk and the surface where the reaction is taking place there is concentration gradient and ideally if the diffusion control has to be out of picture in that case the concentration gradient should not be large and this concentration can be reached if you assume that there is no substrate consumption at the surface .   106.7550938259842
Normally what is happening is that this substrate is getting transported from bulk to the surface and at the surface reaction is taking place .   86.38375199291887
One of the two , which is larger , is required to be considered .   25.729705286555095
This is what we were talking about the external film diffusion and the other part of the whole story of the steady state analysis is related to internal pore diffusion .   26.659213807402487
Therefore it will become very important that we look at the concentration of substrate available for the enzymatic reaction within the pores of the reaction .   20.2032879157367
K ’ m + Ss I mentioned Ss that means I am excluding the film diffusion .   312.7430417955859
Whatever concentration of substrate that has reached at the surface from there to the pores of the particle we are considering .   30.873179453492984
We will consider the case where the two parameters or rather all the three biochemical reaction , external film diffusion and internal pore diffusion are taking place .   28.27631339120268
That means a very physical conceptual picture of effectiveness factor can be considered .   69.77444881668364
If you consider a very hypothetical condition a single pore as a part of the matrix .   92.96398815981273
This is surface ; this is thin film .   96.65889140014673
The other is the substrate is also getting consumed during the reaction .   10.418604153146381
So therefore if suppose the bulk substrate concentration is itself very low there is likely hood that by the time the substrate reaches to the inside pores , center of the particle there is no substrate present and reaction cannot take place even if enzyme is there .   225.61567141118752
You will see from this relationship that maximum effectiveness factor can be one because that means the you have a enzyme reaction rate under the condition when the whole enzyme particle is flooded with the substrate , the same substrate concentration what is present at surface is present across the particle , at all surface at all the pores and under that condition the effectiveness factor will be one .   158.94444351341457
There is very tricky situation ; in many cases people have also reported effectiveness factor exceeding unity ; experimental observations .   269.76650165727926
You measure the enzyme activity lets say for example for different particle size in a reactor and the effectiveness factor works out to be more than one .   37.89709136107388
Under what conditions the effectiveness factor should be more than one ?   18.86300746575779
When the concentration goes down , reaction rate increases and therefore the effectiveness factor is one .   24.949920098929844
pH . If suppose the product of the reaction provides you a change in the micro environment ; let us say hydrogen ions are produced .   39.97364097650713
Then also we will notice the effectiveness factor to be greater than one .   31.715930986839215
When you take the whole particle in account then the bulk of the particle experiencing lower substrate concentration means higher reaction velocity and so therefore this ratio will become more than one or in other words if you take two particles one of larger diameter other is smaller diameter the reaction rate in the larger particle may be more than in the smaller particle .   166.80535173727304
That is what it means by effectiveness factor of one and in many cases of substrate inhibitor systems this is a usual pattern which is noticed .   95.99366501222377
No . The comparison will be only when we take the same reaction and in reactor performance equation in addition to internal pore diffusion you also consider partitioning effects .   87.82642695151246
Then you cannot really compare the two only by a steady state analysis or mass transfer and biochemical reaction .   50.32849212085513
At the moment we are talking only of mass transfer and biochemical reaction .   6.094312582244824
Partitioning also can be incorporated and which can give you a real performance .   69.14907245367534
In the case of internal pore diffusion a steady state analysis can be made .   21.089908516843924
In a simplistic way we consider a pore to be a single cylindrical catalyzed pore .   220.60624360145414
We assume in a very simplistic way that the enzyme is taking place in a cylindrical pore .   13.36468779802884
Consider a small differential element in this pore and along which the mass balance can be made .   216.13674660990006
This is Ss , the substrate concentration on the surface and this goes down across the pore .   59.486786597624224
If you make a mass balance across this differential element at steady state you see the output of the substrate will be –pR2.D ( ds / dx ) out .   33.72757088674238
Input is pR2.D ( ds / dx ) in .   58.953623175913584
At steady state : –pR2.D ( ds / dx ) out + pR2.D ( ds / dx ) in + v ’ ( 2pR ) dx This should be equal to zero as at steady state we make a mass balance of substrate across the differential element we get this .   80.27228236768211
I must again here remind one thing ; this reaction velocity is based on surface area and not volumetric reaction velocity as we are usually used to in the case of soluble enzymes .   134.9176698560505
v ’ is based on surface area unlike in the case of soluble enzyme where we usually represent based on the volumetric reaction velocity and that ’ s why we have multiplied by 2pR .   116.36653161335718
v ’ = 0 This gives you a generalized second order differential equation which can be set for internal pore diffusion cum biochemical reaction .   82.8798463503561
Here you can make modification ; if you transfer the reaction velocity in the volumetric form like for example kV = kS.S These are the two rate constants ; zero order or first order based on volumetric and surface area and in that case for a cylindrical pore the k will be equal to k = kS.S / v = 2kS / R Therefore one can write here as d2s / dx2 – v ’ = 0 as the basic second order differential equation a solution of which can give you if you substitute the reaction rate term here depending on the nature of the reaction either by assuming a first order kinetics or zero order kinetics or even Michaelis Menten kinetics and Michaelis Menten kinetics will require a numerical solution and analytical solution may be difficult and you can get the solution of the substrate concentration as a function of the distance x from the surface .   139.22617591687018
A solution of this will give you the substrate concentration profile in the pore or inside the particle .   32.81866252494277
This can be written for variety of cases and solved within boundary conditions so as to give you the reactor performance .   69.12337394441505
I think we will now stop at this point .   10.490526224297392
Welcome back to this 8 th lecture of this course in Polymer Chemistry .   2.2832974659673995
And I will be telling you what is my expectation at the end of this module .   71.70790489209918
Now , let us look at the whatever topic we covered in the last lecture .   32.88619677713042
In the last lecture we have covered the cyclization verses linear polymerization , what are the conditions which prefer linear polymerization , which are different the preferred ones .   126.02054001227502
And at the end we discussed the complete list of conditions or the criteria , which one must be maintaining during the polymerization or at the beginning of the polymerization to have a successful step polymerization .   55.035570807804326
And you have done whatever I have been instructed to you have done that .   130.60551738320993
In spite of doing that you found that at the end of the reaction your desired polymer has not formed .   67.57525227334912
That means , you must be expecting a high molecular weight you have got a low molecular weight polymers .   46.96938100718318
Now , if we find any monomer there , which means that during the polymerization one or more than one monomers has escaped by volatilization .   225.43910825298073
And that is going to imbalance your monomer ratio , you must have you might have taken one is one ratio or whatever very close to one what is your target molecular weight .   94.43460532926424
Now , what are the ways you can tackle this , one thing you can do if you find that their monomers are getting volatilized during the reaction .   44.145218072373716
And when a reaction has progressed some for some duration and then duration there is a chance that monomers might form dimer or small molecular weight , oligomers .   510.41234551198596
Now , if you apply the vacuum or reduce the pressure , then chances of you know vocalization of the monomers comes down .   74.67116524758809
And at the finally , when your molecular weight the conversion is you know quite high , there are less amount of monomer present in the reaction medium , you ramp the temperature as high as possible , you know and then you reduce the pressure as much as possible .   89.03966714735043
Second thing you can analyze the product , if the product is colored or if you by analyzing the reaction mixture of the end of the product at the end of the reaction we find there are new molecules .   82.56303613665364
And what you have to do to tackle this you will understand what is going on and understand the chemistry behind this side reaction and then do whatever now your best way to minimize this side reaction unwanted reactions .   139.78546589176335
And sometimes the catalyst , which you are using in the reaction that might be one source , which might be catalyzing the side reactions as well .   36.66987921304471
So , that your side reactions comes down as low as possible , one side reactions we can consider during polyester formations .   242.97044686173626
So , with this you can generate free acid group and a alkene group here , at this is very common by if you have a beta hydrogen present then by doing a 6 membered considered reaction , it might do a side reaction .   125.10924927976065
And you can end up getting new functional group or new products , which might give you color in the at the end of the reaction , so that is one example .   45.12798372557306
Now , let us go back to the last lecture , we talked about that the k rate constant for step polymerization is quite low 10 to the minus 3 liter per mole per second .   32.58224191656184
Now , there are few exceptions , there are actually very few exception , one example is the reactions with diacid chlorides .   237.64420900671777
Now , these diacid chloride reactions with dial or diamine there are very fast and k r of the order of 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 5 L in term of per second inverse , which means they are much fast reaction compared to the normal step polymerization reactions .   128.9448139954969
And I will come to the example of interfacial and polymerization .   46.38774103478409
For example the polycarbonate , most of the polycarbonate major rate of the polycarbonates are synthesized by this interfacial polymerization bisphenol this is the monomer bisphenola .   423.667759502166
And this is phosgene bisphenola is taken in the aqua sodium hydroxide solution and phosgene is passed through a organic solvent , in this case say methylene chlorideforming BPA PC or bisphenola poly carbonate .   453.5629535404748
Now , what is the mechanism , you have BPA bisphenol a present in the aqua solutions of sodium hydroxide , so you have phenolate salt .   175.81200370762224
Now , what is what is the problem here the only one thing to consider that this is a water soluble monomer , this bisphenola in a sodium hydroxide solution and this phosgene is formed through the organic medium in this case methylene chloride .   214.68566402889743
So , when this is formed this is a methylene chloride soluble species , so this will stay in the methylene chloride solution .   107.105475065504
To react , now if you what to if you what this to react with the bisphenola phenolate ion to form a poly carbonate species , this has to migrate to the interface , this is currently now in the organic phase and this is in the aqueous phase .   189.50735127481437
So , the reaction the chances of reacting of this two species is low , the chances of this species reacting with this species is low .   72.79954461183172
So , now , you have a water soluble species , again this is water soluble .   37.05317208878398
So , now , they can do reaction in the water side of the interface , so the reaction become faster .   43.0123883328491
So , you have to add this amine catalyst to facilitate the reaction and have the reaction happening in first way , no first space .   282.5769645621953
The same thing you can do if you what to keep this in the organic medium you can add a phase transfer catalyst in the water side , which will then complex with this bisphenol a salt and bring it closer to the organic medium .   136.47550322442217
So , either you can add trimethylamine to bring this species to closer to water side or you can add a phase transfer catalyst to bring this bisphenol a ion to the organic side to make the reaction faster .   320.85758674825996
Now , because reaction is very fast you saw the rate constant of the reaction is very high .   25.205057289435178
So , the reaction is very fast , so you can do it at low temperature in room temperature and it is usually done at a temperature between 0 to 50 degree centigrade .   17.15327081827296
Now , because the reaction is happening in the interface and at interface one one reactant is reacting with one of the other reactant .   85.17112337614563
So , the stoichiometry at the reaction side , which is the interface is always maintained at one is to one .   23.085309116438488
So , you do not need make a effort to maintain the stoichiometry of the two monomers close to one is to one .   44.88658260272616
And in other case normal linear poly condensation case you have dimmer , trimer , tetramer and it go slowly one after one , but in this case the monomers comes by diffusion to the interface reacts with the chain end .   201.36769567854918
Unlike the normal poly condensation or step polymerization process .   13.008172350748882
In this case the example I showed you polycarbonate the sodium hydroxide was present to neutralize the HCl byproduct .   453.27590411732837
Then the reactivity will come down the reaction rate will be much lower and it will not happen it will not take place in the temperature we are working .   37.49437215316981
So , if you start well you can generate more and more interface and by doing by generating more and more interface you can make the reaction the polymerization reaction faster .   124.7933486510547
And the main disadvantages are that the acid chloride acid chlorides are very costly .   357.9284242481199
So , you know increasingly people are trying to avoid this root simply to avoid this use of large amount of organic solvent , which are not environmentally friendly .   195.47029077861902
So , you need to take out the polymerization by precipitation for example , in poly carbonate case the poly carbonate are solvable in the methylene chloride phase .   283.6230330197468
So , this byproduct as the byproduct HCl is not taking part in the reverse reaction , so this reaction is kinetically controlled .   20.695859657951974
So , chances of having more cyclics are more in this interfacial polymerization .   27.61486457677535
Starting from polyester this is not exclusive least of polymers or it is not the detailed synthetic process or all the processes , which are utilized commercially .   334.01938896533574
But , this reactions we know this direct esterification of alcohol and acids or say ester an acid groups are very slow reactions .   426.43828604428893
So , you may require high temperature , so this are typical not used commercially this two reactions are not used commercially .   170.0144775976029
It is a two stage ester exchange process , first stage dimethyl terephthalicd M T is reacted with excess of ethylene glycol at say around moderate temperature and methanol is distilled out to form this compound .   551.0386877559579
So , this is the most this is the commercial root of synthesis poly and these are the names trade names , which under which under which this poly ethylene terephthalate are sold in the market .   96.3369682495676
And this is you know it is known as nylon 6 6 and this is very common polymers starting from hexamethylene diamine and adipic acids .   105.838191073079
In this case we cannot simply do the polymerization reaction with diamine and diacids you require much reactive component functional group .   130.28869825116016
And this is known as kepler as a trade name and this is nomex and these are both nomex and kepler have very high melting points .   307.69763250388064
You know they are used for very high in the application where you require very high temperature to sustain even kepler has a melting point which is higher than 500 centigrade , sometimes it even burn before it melt .   139.0703037879229
Move to the next one which is cross link polyester in this case one example can be taken is a maleic anhydride reaction with ethylene glycol ; and once it forms the polymerization is complete at the end you have a double bond in the polyester back bone .   71.99158603575557
Now , this double bond are available to react radically or some other chain polymerization mechanism by itself alone , are you can add a another monomers like styrene or MMA methyl methacrylate and then copolymerized with and form a cross link .   157.833031770949
So , you can cross link this polyester unsaturated polyester chains , so by doing this we can make a cross linked network .   64.35243443401282
Next set of polymers we go is polysulfones and polyketones the generic structure is this its similar to the bisphenol astructure is polycarbonate X is , but in this case X is allied instead of H and Y is either a carbonyl or SO 2 group .   661.3929726308874
Now , typically this aromatic halides are not very reactive towards a nucleophilic substitution reaction , but because you have a strong electron withdrawing group present here CO or CO 2 , CO or SO 2 this becomes more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution .   149.50606193900364
And the commonly these are called I will show you the example in the next slide , if you have CO these are called polyketones and specifically this structure is called poly ether ether ketones and simple this called polyether ketone , you have if you have a sulfonegroup SO 2 group in here then these are polysulfones .   648.7299756332087
So , this is poly ether ether ketone , this is polyether ketone , this is poly bisphenol a polyether sulfone and this is simply called polyether sulfone .   564.8537416647662
And this is these are the trade names of this polymers in this trade name they are sold Radel and Udel .   102.60970623192806
So , they are they are again very high performance high performing polymers , which are used at very high temperature applications ; and they can be used in a applications where the constant temperature is say around as high as 240 to 280 degree .   81.21356893796957
So , they are very you know high performing polymers this poly sulfonesor polyether sulfones , they are amorphous in nature the T g is around one they are also very high T g 180 to 230 and they have continuous use temperature is between 150 to 200 .   198.3883181702742
Next set we move to poly aromatic polyimides , these are formed by reaction with diamine with dianhydridedi , an aromatic dianhydrideso aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic dianhydrides , And first this is formed then one cyclization this is this imides are formed these are again very high performing polymers they are used for applications requiring very high temperature and they are known in under the trade name of captain and .   442.22093507003314
Now , you can always go through any detailed publications or in a detailed text book where you will find out the detail you know detail method of making this polymers .   215.23726603661555
They are known in the trade name of ultem , there amorphous T g is as high as 215 degree centigrade and there are constant use temperature is between 18 170 to 180 .   101.34212755034501
This is another example another set of polymers is polyamide imides you take this aromatic diamines with one side poly anhydride and the carbo oxalic acid silica acids to form this amide polyamide imides .   1067.3393693664073
So , these is one example of making copolymers in step by step polymerization method you take say a by functional monomers A B type .   224.0251882434561
Now , if you have this along with plus if you have say terephthalic acid in the other side .   39.54699012144894
Now , in this case you make a copolymer , which have this poly ethylene terephthalic unit and also have a polybutylene terephthalate unit .   124.67890152524186
Now , if you normal in the normal step polymerization reaction , because this goes through a thermodynamically control process .   182.30633392567168
That means , the byproducts also take part in the reverse reaction and the chains intermediate chains also take part reactions with exchange reaction between them .   65.63921350690033
So , there is a transfer happening between the extraction is happening between two groups , which means that if the reaction proceed through thermo dynamical control , if the reaction is thermodynamically control controlled .   260.47643493125054
Then you will always land up in a completely random copolymer , you understand why , because this reaction when they are happening there is slow reaction .   96.24194599906929
And by doing , so they are always reshuffling between them self at the end you always have a completely random copolymer .   66.40533651907097
Now , if you are doing the other reaction say for example , if I go back to the polycarbonate example in this case , if I instead of taking this BPA .   55.67600959055848
And you have taken that is one is to one and you are heating with phosgene .   39.535818317670596
Now , in this case reaction is kinetically controlled , which means once the polymer all as a matter of cyclics we just talked about few minutes back .   68.58981637922467
Once they are formed they are not taking part in the reshuffling reaction or reaction with the byproduct reverse reaction with the byproduct .   56.118949295391786
Unlike the earlier case say butylene glycol and ethylene glycol even if there are were any differences in the activity between two hydroxide groups .   239.4363382875716
Ultimately at the beginning even if they are making blocky copolymers at the end by doing reshuffling finally , you would land up in a random copolymer .   112.49302462693662
But in this case , the nature of the copolymer would depend upon the reactivity of the functional group if this functional group is same having same reactivity with the other functional group then it will form a random copolymer .   15.404817784924301
So , you understand the terminally controlled polymers would give always a statistically random copolymer whether whereas , in kinetically controlled polymerization reaction .   450.2585865075447
And you have to consider what is the diffusivity ?   10.290686615787719
You know reactivity coupled with the reactivity if some monomers is diffusing first at the interface it will react faster .   335.09887874121074
So , when I talking about the reactivity it would also include the diffusivity diffusivity aspect of the monomers is well .   265.47110556193206
So , if the if the reaction between the one monomer with the phosgene is faster , then it will be a blocky copolymer .   108.8989702892223
What are the functional groups you require for a step polymers or a chain polymers , so on .   47.43317380596998
So , you should push the reaction as much as possible and also if you want to build a high molecular weight polymer your r should be close to 1 .   14.551553164785421
If you want to control the molecular weight , if have want some reason you want to target some molecular weight with both the ends having some particular functional group or no functional group .   152.5911510126254
Then you should know the strategies if you want to have some functional group at the end of the polymers both side , then you should use the monomers containing that functional groups in higher amount and the ratio should be according to your target .   94.22520733306742
So , if you design you can design highly reactive monomers , then they will have naturally high equilibrium constant .   94.35838959133478
And he also should know that why in reality PDI always end up being slightly higher than two because of side reaction cyclization .   240.41455592628293
And a student should know the condition and you know what are the what are the conditions you know what are the monomers to be used if you what a branching or cross linking .   37.263011188616034
So , what are the ways you can do that or what are the ways you can have avoid that and what are the utilities or the problem if a student being .   85.89920528383351
So , if you what to work in the lab or if you join in the industry you should be able to know what are the complete list of criteria , you know we have gone in last lecture to carry out a successful step polymerization .   97.48127131104971
You should first look for that also you should by know and have a graphs in by this time .   332.7551469384247
And one including what is the fundamental differences in interfacial polymerization they utilize the very first reaction of diacylchloride or diacylchloride .   474.68375003792056
And what are the mechanism and what are the problem in interfacial polymerization .   23.341965475798514
And I also did not I could not include several others .   361.72406123778376
And you should be knowing the polymers , which I have covered in today ’ s lecture .   17.868489041127035
Hello !   1.0
Today we will be talking about immobilized enzymes .   5.813459530670175
So far we have seen the structure and function of enzymes as they are available in the living cells .   11.95233212677016
They also can catalyze a number of stereospecific chemical transformations that are otherwise difficult to carry out in a single step by other chemical routes and also a major advantage of mild operating conditions which make them very attractive industrial catalyst .   333.76964154348394
Bulk of the other industries has not made use of these biocatalysts at least up to the beginning of the last two decades .   211.38098556777695
If you look at the industrial applications until sixties there was not a very significant application of enzymes in industrial processing .   55.351340881791316
The major limitation , you also noticed during our understanding of the structure - function relationship of the enzyme , is that they are usually very unstable and that probably is one of the major limitations as far as enzymes are concerned with respect to their application .   61.28464685599546
Their activity or their function in the normal temperature range also put sometimes a disadvantageous situation in the sense that at those temperatures many of the microbial activities are also optimum and therefore they lead to contamination of products and therefore their industrial application becomes restricted .   640.5827110915186
Also a major factor in the limitations of the application of soluble enzymes in industry has also been the soluble nature of enzymes that means they have to be used in water soluble form .   64.06829931920791
When we have to use them in water soluble form it only means that the process has to be in the batch mode .   73.63119028911947
That means you take an enzyme solution or a substrate solution , add a quantity of soluble enzyme in a batch mode , provide the optimum temperature and pH , carry out the reaction and terminate the reaction by changing one of the operational parameter either by heating it or by drastic change of pH so that the reaction is terminated and then extract the product .   122.88535441071399
In this whole process the major problem is that one has to discard the enzyme , one has to deactivate the enzyme and the enzyme is usually not possible to be recovered at the end of the process .   52.3664600447002
Because recovering the enzyme from reaction mixture will be as difficult or as tedious if not more as production of the original enzyme itself and in most cases enzyme being produced by living systems are usually expensive commodities and therefore their deactivation at the end of one batch operation is not a desirable feature and that has been a major limitation .   425.3653272912311
The two issues of unstability and possibility of their use repeatedly or in a continuous mode has been the major driving force of looking at immobilization as an approach to provide a vector platform for the use of enzyme in industrial application .   448.6187625390331
A major question that will come is what do we mean by immobilization ?   90.46043816005479
That is a definition of immobilized enzymes .   20.06151281467935
This is basically an operational definition .   118.81132148475324
I like you to concentrate on at least three major phrases built in , in this definition .   148.96005219414386
That means the enzyme molecule which is homogenously suspended in a soluble preparation has to be then localized in a narrow region of space and this is no longer uniformly , homogenously distributed in a reaction mixture .   87.10521775728671
An analogy can be made to a heterogeneous catalysis .   24.92484244578569
In the case of chemical catalysis many of the catalyst are used in a heterogeneous phase , while the use of soluble enzyme will provide a homogenous catalysis .   71.36204257472
That means the distribution or composition of every species in the reaction mixture whether it is catalyst or a substrate or a product is uniform throughout the reaction mixture .   117.85920647352066
The use of immobilization enzymes will lead to a heterogeneous catalysis .   19.62927718731376
The second phrase which is very important is the retention of their catalytic activity .   23.645645113811
Otherwise it doesn ’ t have any meaning to have immobilized enzyme preparation .   43.15473358865456
Retention of catalytic activity is a very relative term .   11.742858998176244
So when we say retention of catalytic activity you are implying that a major fraction of the activity must be retained .   67.54668910059371
The major objective , from the industrial point of view , of immobilization enzyme would be to reduce the cost of enzyme input into any processing per unit quantity of the product to a significant level and that is what is often achieved .   95.96623250306125
This definition takes care of the three major factors one is the localization of the enzyme or connectivity over a major substrate and such an immobilization can be achieved by different means .   157.74209964208987
Both the things are feasible .   16.281125064275212
Let us say an ultra filtration cell in which the molecular weight cut off of the membrane is such that the enzyme is not allowed to pass through and retained as the retentate whereas the unconverted substrate and the product formed is passed through a membrane and can be collected .   67.41958814050012
We often consider that if you couple a soluble enzyme molecule on to a solid matrix whether it is an inorganic matrix or an organic matrix or a gel that is the conventional form of immobilization .   115.09839131366832
I presume that you understand what ultra filtration cell is .   62.92856835036982
You have a stern vessel in which at the bottom there is a membrane with a narrow molecular weight cut off .   99.25776971908928
In such a reactor if you use an enzyme by putting substrate in and taking out the product which are low molecular weight compounds and enzyme being high molecular weight molecule will be retained in the reactor during use .   109.37750529402821
Such systems also will be considered as immobilized enzyme systems .   23.488759025583327
In fact although industrially such systems are not very commonly employed as far as the academic study is concerned these systems have been applied .   260.2624877927637
One of the early systems which were applied was way back in late sixties and early seventies to hydrolysis of cellulose and starch .   446.7628210198754
Because the starch product is low molecular weight glucose similarly cellular product is also glucose .   549.5704866020673
That ’ s why it has not industrially become very attractive .   101.9136358288987
There are problems still as far as the cost of the membrane is concerned the following operational problems .   103.54462800663717
Today in the literature we will find probably a few thousand methods of immobilization and not that all of them have been commercially viable , because commercially viability is an issue which is linked directly to economics , the power of economics .   205.70900956944038
So it does not restrict to but what we are talking of the basic definition of immobilized enzyme that you can do it in that matter .   31.697367268549762
As a matter of fact this is an artificial cell as you can consider let us say living cell itself .   19.36158930093221
In living cell also the enzyme is entrapped through a semi permeable membrane which does not allow the enzyme molecules to pass through and some of the product molecules from the cell also are usually ripped off .   106.65083396067922
One is that the scientist wanted to apply some of the enzymes for industrial processing and obviously for industrial processing you need certain operational advantages The major disadvantages in the case of the enzymes is the restriction in the best mode of processing , the stability , some of the physico chemical properties in respect of pH optimum , temperature optimum , substrate specificity and they could all be taken care for industrial processing .   259.019535440135
The second motivating factor was many people also wanted to study the enzymes in their natural habitat or at least as close to the natural habitat .   431.5847406552363
When we talk about the enzyme , structure and functional aspects , we are missing one thing that whatever studies have been made in those aspects they have been made after isolating the enzyme from a cell .   258.8137734203496
If they can try to bring as close to the living environment and the process which they adopted was immobilization .   285.45725473869015
Because most of the enzymes which people understood very well were the membrane bound enzymes and they noticed that in the membrane bound enzyme there was some kind of a physical coupling between the enzyme and the insoluble membrane as a matrix .   162.0940456388818
After isolation from the cell you are trying to bring back because you see when they are in a living cell you have no means to study them excepting indirect calculation that this might be happening and this is the rate of flux .   129.60287115457376
The immobilization offers n number of advantages and one of the major advantages which we have already talked about in the definition itself is its reusability .   152.32224613632556
Instead of the possibility of using only in soluble mode in a batch reactor you can use in a variety of application modes .   101.7356942199132
A variety of reactor types can be used for carrying out the transformation or reactions instead of using only a batch stirred reactor as we can afford only for a soluble enzyme .   106.37756221533732
Another major advantage is the rapid termination of reaction .   36.16260884911705
In the case of the soluble enzyme the only means of terminating a reaction is to deactivate the enzyme either by drastic change of pH , heating , boiling in a water bath or adding some kind of chemical , irreversible inhibitors of an enzyme , which can inactivate the enzyme .   244.44638196449228
But in the case of immobilized enzyme you can repeatedly terminate by physically separating it .   93.62039328578133
Even if you use in a batch mode by physically filtering off the enzyme preparation , the reaction is stopped .   61.50357654229335
That gives you a very great operational significance and the use of an immobilized enzyme also leads to relatively purer product .   152.1231763326719
In the case of a batch mode the enzyme is going along a product stream and in some cases the discharge of proteins into the product stream may cause purification problems .   183.97807941458333
Therefore the use of immobilized preparation in those cases will lead to a much purer product or significant convenience as far as the downstream processing of the product stream is concerned .   96.10116818980723
In the case of food constituent we don ’ t want the enzyme protein to go as a product in the product stream .   64.96697137759105
In most cases the immobilization has also resulted in some altered physico - chemical properties .   74.87730790274067
When I say physico - chemical properties the most important properties probably for which enzymes are considered as poor candidates are their stability .   281.42963803069773
In most cases the stability is enhanced and therefore it becomes a desirable feature .   46.64478721030651
The other altered physico - chemical properties are optimum pH and specificity .   196.00820672495084
But specificity also has been a factor .   13.206656753606524
In fact even one can have an altered km for an immobilized enzyme as compared to soluble enzyme which again depending upon the same feature as optimum pH that is the matrix is charged and the substrate is also charged where the partitioning effects , the apparent km might also change .   76.6546253512079
The third motivating factor was the use of the model system for natural enzymes that we discussed and which also has been a very significant reason for immobilizing enzymes .   69.4607142378991
In fact any immobilized enzyme system has three major constituents , three major players The first player is the soluble enzyme .   129.4535997903551
We have to start with a good preparation of an enzyme isolated from a living system produced by fermentation or isolated from animals or plant cells .   365.0962825170021
You need a soluble enzyme .   5.886686658531751
The other is carrier .   14.728591165411691
You need a matrix to which the enzyme can be immobilized in general .   16.71954213634624
There might be some methods which may be carrier free .   83.7291484372164
For the sake of convenience let us assume that we have to isomerise glucose to fructose with enzyme called glucose isomerase .   57.90105603583255
When we talk of the enzyme for immobilization if we want to …. .. immobilized enzyme preparation what properties are important for choosing the enzyme source ?   108.62499137001352
The major factor is that we will look for an enzyme preparation which has the high specific activity .   32.97263459217006
This will depend upon two factors one is the source of the enzyme and the purity of the enzyme .   20.74340544503556
That means processing cost can be much lesser that is you have to put a much lesser protein for achieving the same catalytic function .   189.27649799818616
One of the major constraints of operational parameters is for many processes the operational parameters required for an enzymatic catalysis should not induce any side reactions .   298.36706544355457
For example take again the example of glucose isomerisation .   80.3014826036942
In such case if you can have an enzyme preparation which has either a neutral or a slightly acidic pH optimum it is desirable .   138.3647992341319
The third factor is stability .   16.34409560030776
One needs to choose the enzyme and its further processing for purification so as to have the three properties which are in the positive region and we choose the soluble enzymes on that basis .   247.46384437261258
In one gram of immobilized enzyme , the enzyme preparation will be probably only a fraction of milligrams or if not more than one or two milligrams .   126.28544543426203
We are taking a water insoluble carrier .   22.33842630508811
I am using a general term reaction environment mainly because while most of the reactions are to be carried out in aqueous medium today there are requirements that many of the reactions may be carried out in organic non - polar medium .   77.05191114705082
Logically the carrier should also be non - toxic to the enzymatic reaction and this should not act as an inhibitor or some kind of an irreversible inhibitor to the enzyme catalyzed reaction .   55.214617422472166
Therefore carrier itself should be very stable otherwise the stability of the enzyme will not have much of meaning .   101.2248433782943
The carrier should also have a large number of sites for binding of enzyme .   6.089515711949806
To have a high functional reactivity one need as much of enzyme .   169.37131061696047
It will also depend on the porosity on the carrier .   26.19564069886657
The porosity of the carrier depends on the surface area which will also result from the porosity as well as the particle size .   49.24853925605953
Normally we will prefer a carrier which is not very expensive .   48.06933245850009
In an inexpensive carrier one may say that you may not be able to meet the other desirable properties .   82.49068230251324
One can choose an expensive carrier provided the carrier can be regenerated at the end of the exhaustion of the enzyme .   61.92480048127697
At the end of the cycle of the operation of an immobilized enzyme preparation , if the carrier can be regenerated it is desirable even if its cost is high .   49.744864277665265
In fact you will notice that in some of the industrially used immobilized enzyme preparations the low cost carriers has been rejected mainly because of some of the undesirable properties that they cannot get you a very high enzyme loading on them and many of the expensive carriers have been used but only under the condition that they can be regenerated .   144.20890524801865
Carriers like organic ion exchange resins like D I cellulose and di Sephadex have been extensively used for immobilization of enzyme by absorption and after use when the whole enzyme is desorbed the carrier is again available for reuse .   635.4977716154007
To take care of all these desirable features of carrier the properties that you look in a carrier are chemical composition , specific surface area that means surface area per unit weight of the carrier , particle size and ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups mainly to achieve a very high degree of loading because one has to choose all the functional group of the enzyme molecule for coupling and therefore hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups on the carrier and finally the cost .   96.2132934447833
These are the four general features of properties one has to look in the carriers .   89.77512329849529
A very generalized scientific approach to classify them will be on the basis of their porosity .   101.3863900184025
That is they can be non - porous .   90.71104609401573
Its use in CSTR is difficult mainly because of its loss through the product stream if it is too fine a particle .   229.07663780299262
Therefore non - porous matrices usually have a limitation of low surface area .   83.75622807225292
Mainly they have been used extensively for bio medical applications where an additional desirable feature other than the ones we mentioned in the carriers is the prevention of interfacial immunological responses in the bio - medical system .   312.71858434860354
The other group of matrices is porous matrices , the most preferred kind of material that are used for industrial applications and these matrices are control pore glass , control pore titanium and variety of other synthetic tailored materials which have been produced commercially for generating a high porosity for coupling of enzymes on them .   274.8055411380159
They are porous in nature but they are usually flexible in the pore size or thermoelastic and the pore is flexible and the typical examples which have been used are collagen , poly acrylamide , gelatin and a large number of other gel structures have been used .   189.4511863696231
In the gel structure you can entrap the enzyme in the gel matrices and the advantage is that the enzyme can experience almost the same kind of water activity or the environment as very close to what is obtained in the case of a living cell .   77.3526670955383
Let us consider the gel matrix and the enzyme entrapped in the lattices .   34.06134132665923
The gel will not allow the enzyme to pass through but the small molecular weight substrate and product can easily be allowed to get in or come out .   73.16762713826598
Then in the case of proteins almost like what we talked about gel structure , collagen and gelatin are typical examples and there is a whole range of synthetic polymers which have been reported and used for immobilizing enzymes which are usually polystyrene based , vinyl polymers , polyacrylamide and so on.You can classify and a large variety of carriers are available for use for immobilizing enzymes and the choice will depend upon various properties that we have listed .   126.44449584056055
So , welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry , and in this lecture today we are continuing our discussion which is left over from last lecture on frictional properties of polymer in dilute solution .   9.033985376572241
We plan to give just an overview of the techniques which can be used for a polymer determination of polymer molecular weight today .   58.43085141571221
Now let us continue the discussion we are having in last lecture .   2.465407424640499
Now as we understand in last lecture that most of the chain most of the polymer chains are flexible , and when they are dissolved in solution and they are moved in solution , they actually carry the solvent molecules which are attached to the polymer coil ; they move along with the polymer coil .   102.16994218899377
Now , it can be easily shown to have this expression ; let me show that .   57.53624335459792
The number of polymer and the moles of polymers can be expressed by mass of the polymer divided by the molecular rate of the polymer V h by total volume .   17.356877315657165
This gives m by V N A V h by M ; m by V is the concentration , c concentration in mass per unit volume .   74.00645426517723
So , we can write this as c by M N a V h .   28.62190300319552
So , you can directly write this expression from this .   32.06157578997258
Now I can rearrange it ; because increasing viscosity is given by limits c tends to 0 eta s p by c which is basically given by N A eta s p by c which is you can write from here , you divide by c and you get this expression .   43.69178764924002
This is the volume of a polymer coil one polymer coil and this is the molecular weight ; that means mass of one polymer coil ; that means intrinsic viscosity relates inversely to the density ; it is inverse to the density of the random coil .   99.06831852252093
As we discussed for branched polymer if you compare between linear and a branched polymer from same molecular weight , the branch will have more compact volume .   83.5397032965694
So , it may have much lower hydrodynamic volume per coil .   123.6739653555462
So , intrinsic viscosity does not depend only on the volume ; it depends on inverse of the density .   45.740422099556426
If the two polymer coils have same hydrodynamic volume , irrespective of their chemical and structural difference , the product of intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight will be same .   25.238364459256534
So , hydrodynamic volume will be lower in this case .   5.852227341060293
So , molecular weight is M ; in this case molecular weight also M .   30.206490603650348
Segment density of the coil is lower ; segment density is higher .   64.07214223270735
Now we will further treat this expression and see whether we can arrive at an expression which can help us in determining the molecular weight by dilute solution viscometry .   35.35009420924693
So , this title is probably inappropriate at this moment .   211.79692471127228
We have got this earlier .   46.596572407287404
So , I am writing this .   8.368206926368746
This is the volume of this particle .   18.238983059402084
Now remember while discussing the radius of gyration , we discussed that radius of gyration is almost like the radius of that sphere .   39.604735902332
So , the volume V h would be proportional to the R g cube ; volume given by four - third pi r square , r is this r .   292.08653938587776
So , we can write that V h is proportional ; this proportionality sign is missing here .   66.344598990531
V h is proportional to the radius of gyration to the power 3 and radius of gyration can be written as the expansion factor and radiation gyration for the unpart of chain .   77.91489766532395
Now , we can remove this proportionality by applying or introducing a constant ; this is a constant .   198.08243855423518
So , remember this should be h because we have mentioned h in the last lecture .   68.23531112879382
This is expansion happened due to because the polymer coil is in solvent .   123.97514588478764
We can rearrange this expression and write like this which is just a mathematical rearrangement ; you can write this .   29.464684269756706
So , what we are doing here ; this is a constant as I just discussed , this is also constant and we are clubbing these two in another constant and you have the expansion factor and molecular weight to the power half .   57.63360495514785
Remember we just discussed in last lecture which just means this is not exactly , but this is approximately proportional .   94.09425750096341
So , you can now write ; you can express this is in terms of molecular weight and then couple those two and write k is M to power A .   82.55540557645499
So if you change any of these three polymer solvent and temperature , then k and a value will be changed .   13.137681385372321
So , these values also will change .   52.04152931720716
But for linear flexible chains , it will be between 0.5 to 0.8 and for theta condition what we have seen earlier for theta condition , what is the value of a s or expansion factor for theta condition efficient ?   147.96645649893412
So , it is same as if there was no expansion of the coil due to the presence of the solvent .   41.367922840000126
So , the value of expansion factor becomes more than one .   14.28569059068624
So , a value becomes more than 0.5 .   21.343092802623836
a is more informative in polymer ; you will find that a is more probably more important than between these two constant .   263.976790584163
So , the expansion factor will be ; if you compare the expansion factor of unperturbed linear polymer chain it may go down below that below one .   88.83747309152032
As I said we will use this expression Mark - Houwink expression when we try to determine the molecular weight ; we will discuss the determination of molecular weight of polymer chain by viscosity method .   38.59950847778987
Now let us start our very important discussion how to determine the molecular weight and at the beginning what I would like to do I will just give an overview of the techniques which are available and used to determine the molecular weight .   33.5957735041786
Actually you can divide these techniques into two types ; one is absolute molecular weight determination where we do not require any calibration curve of priority by known polymer molecular weights .   139.61928553369546
And there are relative methods where you actually require a calibration curve by known polymer molecular weight where the molecule and the molecular have been determined by these absolute techniques .   292.7955168352644
We will discuss the principle and the other things the process while we discuss this techniques individually .   144.00756555619725
Instead of spending more time on this table , which we will discuss in more detail when we discuss the individual techniques , let us move to the actual techniques .   145.62894821591397
Now we have seen that this is the expression for dilute polymers , the intrinsic viscosity of polymers in dilute polymer solution and what I can find out .   27.005238526027078
So , the molecular weight given is M v where M v is viscosity average molecular weight .   35.88673908835371
Now as you know that radial polymer mixtures , there are numerous polymer chains having different molecular weight .   93.59384965982623
So in intrinsic , these are the assumptions we are making that specific viscosity can be obtained by summing up the specific viscosity of the individual polymer chain .   148.4071320398553
So if the solution is very dilute , then we can write eta s p i is c i eta i .   111.78024592198804
Third is the intrinsic viscosity of i chain is given by k M i a ; that means what we are assuming that k and a values are independent of the molecule .   59.99662229663642
So , eta s p i is the intrinsic viscosity of n i moles of molecules having molecular weight M i present at a concentration of c i per unit volume .   52.910676067490904
So , c i can be written as n i is the number of molecule ; M i is the molecular weight of that molecule .   21.10386205987191
So , this gives you total mass of i molecule divided by volume mass .   237.38335297944639
We can continue to write this is as summation of eta i c i by c .   163.45242018020662
So , we can write n i M i by V .   4.240320512760481
Now we can write ; so you get this expression .   9.479139983482106
So , you get this expression .   3.3783573266044535
So , in the expression of this m V we just found out that it is having the expression of this .   35.85178284170119
If a is one which we just we discussed it is for highly elongated rod like molecule , then m V would be same as M w .   71.57001475195524
If a one then it will be n i M i square by n i M i .   19.206031299193768
Let me write in a fresh paper .   70.47089105370416
So , how to get the value for M v ?   6.059373056980707
If you know k and a ; if k and a are known , obviously you can find experimentally the value of intrinsic viscosity and then if you know k and a value , then you will be able to find the value for M v .   34.3579521781177
What happened if k and a are not known ?   7.305381531133126
So , if you plot log of intrinsic viscosity with log of viscosity average molecular weight , the intercept will give you log k and the slope will give you a .   38.37920012417492
For unknown sample , then how do you determine the viscosity average molecular weight ?   9.04919416829982
Then what you need to do ; you need to plot log of intrinsic viscosity with many known molecular weight and then you do you do a experimental take five to ten samples and make dilute solutions from that determine the intrinsic viscosity and plot this to get log k and a .   117.42235654582332
Now the question is here ?   22.538659790554963
You need to plot log M v ; that is what you need to determine .   35.741001616947045
If you are plotting here log m v , now you are again targeting M v for the unknown molecules .   290.13620744971763
Now known molecular weight can be either M n or M w which you already determined by the absolute techniques .   26.138459147950975
Now actually this is supposed to M v , the expression gives you k is eta is k M v to the power a .   156.84890961970618
So , ideally you should have M v value for all these samples which you do not have because that is what you are determining .   115.05458266311615
So , what samples you will use for calibration where M v is much closer to any of the known molecular weight , say , M n and M w .   97.63526617436301
Now if you have very narrow dispersed polymer , then you can consider M w or M n is same as M v .   21.692502474116626
If you have very narrow dispersed polymer then M w are very close to M v .   14.773981805537593
So , you can take those M w ’ s and use here and do the calibration curve .   93.78625975060325
Then you can determine the viscosity average molecule rate of the unknown sample which k and a is not known in the literature .   82.42590111213237
Now how will you determine ?   9.786491528835137
Eta is given by limit c tends to 0 eta s p by c .   4.384779787358387
Now if for a dilute solution , the plot of eta s p versus c is linear only till your eta r is less than equals to 2 .   73.52903405439403
So , if your eta value of the solution is twice 2x the eta 0 maximum , then you can find out that eta s p is linearly related with the concentration term .   83.9442825091971
So , we can write the eta s p is linearly related to c concentration only till eta r is less than 2 .   78.07548365377163
So eta s p by c can be written as , this is the slope of that linear relationship between eta s p by c with c and that is only applicable till eta r is less than 2 .   42.74124903964594
So , we need to find out something else where that constant can be applied to any of the molecular rate of the polymer chains .   33.598414091787994
So , Huggins found out that k versus eta square is linear and pass through origin ; k is the slope .   243.9111424048668
So , we can write d eta s p by c by d c ; this is the slope k that is proportional linear .   77.18977897604626
Now because Huggins has established this relationship , sometimes this k 1 is written as k H .   406.38759898413156
Now this is constant for a particular polymer solvent temperature system .   4.885312521188123
It is of course independent of M w of the polymer .   27.328402785445167
Now in this case from this Huggins expression or Huggins equation , you only need the value of k H .   58.773472662892104
So the solution remains very dilute , then you can keep the expression for eta from the intercept and if you know k H , then you can get the expression ; you can get the value of molecular weight directly .   57.24448036542502
So , it will be a negative quantity .   26.517531203041678
In case of Kramer that constant is negative we just saw .   362.25153962239375
In case of Kramer this is negative , so the slope will be negative .   44.53972621300318
So , this will be eta reduced plot for eta reduced and the other one will be plot eta inherent .   154.47873412605634
So , these are all in your hand .   11.912446763131904
So basically you plot , you make different solution with different concentration and plot ; with this you get the intrinsic viscosity .   80.2028584402985
So once you know this , if you know k and a , you can use this expression to find out M v .   24.571932867155496
And you find out the intrinsic viscosity for this given polymer and then by plotting log intrinsic viscosity versus log molecular weight , you can get k and a value ; from that you can get this M v .   79.26846338112973
It must be in dilute solution , a very dilute solution region and also you need to remember that relative number in this method , you cannot get a measurement for an unknown polymer as such .   165.37174642474463
It is not absolute method ; it is a relative method .   22.54585907041273
We were yesterday talking about reversible inhibition that is those inhibitor molecules which reduce the rate of an enzymatic reaction by reversible interaction with enzyme molecule and after the inhibition is over they can be physically separated and the enzyme can be recovered in its original catalytic functional form .   147.32918310122727
These reversible inhibitors are often categorized into three major classes based on certain general features and some of the general features which are used to classify them are : One is pattern of binding of the inhibitor to either the enzyme molecule or the enzyme substrate complex or in another words it leads to specific mechanistic steps which are involved in the inhibitory effect .   96.14959267105921
That means the enzyme reaction rate is modified or rather reduced to a new state in the presence of those inhibitor molecules .   87.63057627412113
A particular class of inhibitor gives you a typical effect on the value of Km or Vm .   21.713091070619097
Finally the type of inhibitor also influences the ultimate degree of inhibition .   82.94363209524123
As I mentioned earlier the degree of inhibition is defined as i = v0 - vi / vo where i is the degree of inhibition and v0 and vi are the enzyme reaction rate at concentration of inhibitor at zero and at some particular concentration i for the enzyme reaction .   108.89674718647828
The maximum reaction velocity remains unchanged .   4.313827838910816
Then degree of inhibition for the competitive inhibition also depends upon all the parameters and the expression for degree of inhibition for competitive inhibitor can be written as Km.I / Ki i = { Km ( 1 + I / Ki ) } + S The degree of inhibition depends on substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration and also on Km and Ki .   87.91944764907872
This is what we had discussed yesterday .   58.234689858667785
Now if we come to the next major class of reversible inhibitor which is a non - competitive inhibitor , the classical feature of a non - competitive inhibitor in terms of binding with the enzyme or the enzyme substrate is that the inhibitor does not influence in any way the substrate binding .   65.87492542543777
Substrate as well as the inhibitor binds reversibly , randomly and independently at different sites .   16.822075985887654
That means the binding site on the enzyme molecule for the substrate is different from the binding site for the inhibitor molecule .   18.833971121169615
The enzyme molecule binds to both ; substrate as well as inhibitor and the resulting ESI complex is functionally inactive .   47.981044934370175
Therefore one can look at the reaction mechanism as k1 k2 E + S ES E + P k - 1 A classical route involving k1 , k - 1 and k2 .   28.151790361209382
E + S ES E + P + + I I EI + S ESI The enzyme can also bind to inhibitor giving EI and because the binding site of the substrate is different , EI can again bind to form ESI and the ES can also bind to I to give ESI .   126.13329096476843
But only thing is that this ESI complex once formed is catalytically inactive and does not lead to product formation .   119.09352562408603
In a simplistic mechanism we notice that we have a dissociation constant Km for the enzyme substrate binding and dissociation constant Ki for the inhibitor binding .   93.50320726102963
Similarly when substrate binds to EI complex , dissociation constant is Km .   127.03087147317788
Under such conditions one can write the rate expression for a non - competitive inhibitor as S .   31.327224330587995
Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) v0 = Km + S One can very clearly visualize that the effect of a non - competitive inhibitor is to influence the maximum reaction velocity and maximum reaction velocity is reduced by factor of ( 1 + I / Ki ) whereas the Km value remains unchanged .   90.20228479777768
There is no effect on the Km value .   3.4170644682624283
The modified maximum reaction velocity is equal to Vm ’ = Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) If you look at into the mechanic concept the total fraction of the enzyme molecule which was originally present for catalytic function has now got distributed into ES , EI and EIS and only a part of it which is in the form of ES is catalytically functional and therefore the maximum reaction velocity which is a function of enzyme concentration is reduced .   136.95161702156068
So the net effect on the maximum reaction rate is experienced .   48.48680888733829
It is the E0 which is modified or reduced by a factor of 1 + I / Ki .   45.72645041678177
Once the inhibitor is present the E0 will be distributed into free enzyme , E , ES , EI and ESI .   319.4119838922665
E0 is not reduced but the effective total concentration of the enzyme , E ’ 0 , which is catalytically functional is reduced and it is only the ES component which is catalytically functional .   163.87605137426985
The second part which is demonstrated is the catalytic function which is given by K2 , the turn over number .   25.059190778613594
That can be influenced by binding of the inhibitor .   10.57626309636644
This is where the question comes that when the substrate and the inhibitor both are bound it influences the whole molecule in such a way that catalytic function is lost .   103.1277403399609
It is a dead end complex and then the binding site on the enzyme which is bound by the substrate is not able to give the product .   23.42855778093083
The double reciprocal plot in the presence of non - competitive inhibitor is given as 1 / v = Km / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) .1 / S + 1 / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) In the case of a non - competitive inhibitor both the slope as well as intercept will undergo a change and both this slope and intercept has increased by a magnitude 1 + I / Ki and therefore if you look at the pattern of the Lineweaver Burk plot you get an increasing concentration of I .   38.80898958108982
Let us assume that this is I = 0 and some values of I as I1 and I2 .   39.37374642413858
The slope and the intercept are both increasing by a magnitude of 1 + I / Ki .   52.09215164589908
Therefore one can determine the value of Ki as we saw in the case of competitive inhibitor by a secondary plot .   15.975275736351787
That means either you determine slope or intercept at different inhibitor concentration and make a plot between I and slope or intercept .   335.0728674144088
You will get a straight line because slope will be equal to Slope = Km / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) Therefore one can determine the value or magnitude of Ki either by plotting the slope verses the inhibitor concentration or by intercept .   71.114640579712
Either way one can determine and that can give you the magnitude of inhibition constant .   36.73008966171928
The third category of the reversible inhibitor is un - competitive inhibition .   30.102719174248662
Only when the substrate is bound to the enzyme it can bind to the enzyme substrate complex and after binding of the inhibitor the ES complex becomes an inactive complex and the inhibitor does not bind to the free enzyme .   29.74801434736485
This is the dissociation constant Ki , classical Km and K2 .   73.95329493053454
Such situations are very rare as far as the unisubstrate reactions are concerned .   133.97403769022844
Most of these cases are usually related to bisubstrate reactions particularly because you notice here that the inhibitor binds after the substrate is bound .   103.00087512803087
In cases only where there is ordered sequence of binding of the ligands , the un - competitive inhibition is feasible .   142.47237052153645
In cases where the binding is random , that means the inhibitor and substrate can bind randomly without any sequence , the mechanism of un - competitive inhibition is very rare .   95.24740412384757
The idea of un - competitive inhibition has been very , very useful in understanding the reaction mechanism for bi substrate reactions .   45.238734101664484
In the case of an un - competitive inhibition the reaction velocity can be written as S .   7.701702633012746
Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) v = Km / ( 1 + I / Ki ) + S Km ’ = Km / ( 1 + I / Ki ) ; Vm ’ = Vm / ( 1 + I / Ki ) Both the parameters are reduced by a factor of ( 1 + I / Ki ) and the double reciprocal plot in the presence of un - competitive inhibitor will be 1 / v = Km / Vm.1 / S + 1 / Vm ( 1 + I / Ki ) Therefore you will notice that the un - competitive inhibitor does not change the slope .   64.05716339652321
The typical pattern of an un - competitive inhibitor looks like parallel lines where the slope doesn ’ t change but the intercept value 1 / Vm is changed .   345.98228116871223
It is increased by a factor 1 + I / Ki .   26.22316652227794
In many cases we will also notice that the actual inhibitor does not follow a very typical pattern and very often we end up with a profile that intersects neither on the y - axis nor on the x - axis and intersects somewhere in the middle point .   79.06090146825463
This is a typical case of a non - competitive inhibition .   9.322074801475246
In non - competitive inhibition we considered the binding of the inhibitor to either the substrate or the free enzyme .   15.142015307372448
The dissociation constant for binding of inhibitor to enzyme may be different from the dissociation constant for inhibitor binding to ES complex and there might be an interaction factor of alpha .   30.585112008015766
E binds to I with the dissociation factor of Ki to form EI .   247.6676541959099
ES binds to the inhibitor with inhibition constant of a Ki to form ESI and substrate binds to EI .   195.040311654588
If you replot the modified intercept as a function of inhibitor concentration it will give you a Ki and therefore value of a can be determined .   113.54299223159758
They are mixed type of inhibition patterns and mixed inhibition pattern are attributed to modification in the dissociation constant as they are obtained .   73.58215741967871
Another general feature which gives you the properties or the characteristic of any type of inhibition pattern is degree of inhibition .   34.79828324063238
If you recall from all the rate expressions that we wrote for the different types of inhibition pattern i = v0 - vi / v0 For non - competitive inhibitors , if you substitute the rate expression for the inhibitor and uninhibited reaction for the non - competitive reactions the value of I will be I / Ki + I which indicates that the degree of inhibition is independent of substrate concentration , unlike in the case of competitive inhibition where increasing substrate inhibition can significantly decrease the degree of inhibition .   117.09860771336542
( 1 + I / Ki ) The degree of inhibition will rise from S = 0 when there is no reaction to a limiting value of 1 + I / Ki at very high value of substrate concentration .   62.563150229308505
When the substrate concentration becomes very high , the degree of inhibition will be 1 + I / Ki but it will depend like competitive inhibition on all the parameters , the substrate concentration , inhibitor concentration , Ki and Km .   63.29119787231
In the case of mixed inhibition , the degree of inhibition will be largely dependent upon the magnitude of a .   22.86471858923934
The mixed inhibition is a special case of non - competitive inhibition where otherwise substrate concentration does not influence the degree of inhibition .   18.99634043741313
So these are some of the typical categories of inhibition pattern which are commonly noted and they have a key role to play in understanding the mechanism of variety of complex reactions particularly the bi - substrate reactions .   54.814258381296945
In the case of single substrate reaction , that is what we have been talking so far , the life is simple because there is only one substrate and we are concerned with the binding of the substrate .   16.035826446477618
In the case of bisubstrate reactions we have much more possibilities , much more types of mechanistic approaches that are feasible and they are taken into account .   75.74796053145288
When we say very high substrate concentration , S &gt ; &gt ; Km and we are talking of zero order design and then the degree of inhibition at very high substrate concentration will be significantly very high because then it will reach the limiting value of 1 + I / Ki .   38.610334060139714
Km becomes K and S gets cancelled and then degree of inhibition will be I / Ki. ( 1 + I / Ki ) .   76.75539955776716
If you look at a very generalized scheme of inhibition patterns kES E + S ES E + P kEI kESI EI ESI kES If you consider each of the reversible steps , we are not here really concerned with the irreversible step because that determines the rate of the reaction , the interaction of the reversible step the dissociation constant for this step is KES , this is the KEI , this is KESI and this is also KES .   351.40285652530633
KES and KEI will have definite magnitude .   219.39290204273433
That means the enzyme can bind either to inhibitor or to a substrate and KES and KEI will have definite magnitude but the KESI either will be infinity and that is the typical case of a competitive inhibitor .   336.59567731845544
In the case of a non - competitive inhibitor KESI will be equal to KEI .   33.514913096714736
That means the inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme .   18.817698856695362
The three cases are typical examples of three extreme situations of the inhibitor binding .   173.04761876111695
In the case of mixed inhibition they are not identical but they have a magnitude and both are related by ratio of a and which determines the degree of inhibition .   35.04351326369649
In the case of un - competitive inhibition , the dissociation constant for the binding of inhibitor to the free enzyme approaches to infinity .   10.936770426571496
With that view I think we would like to look at the other bisubstrate reactions subsequently and we will stop at this point .   36.75108954029545
Welcome to this lecture fourteen of the course on polymer chemistry .   26.837977342603345
Let us just recap couple of minutes on the topics we covered in last lecture .   32.14741896935431
We talked about the dependence on temperature , dependence of rate of polymerization and molecular weight on the temperature for radical polymerization initiated by different mechanism , thermal initiator , photochemical initiator and redox initiator .   73.36347395836611
We in summary we knew that the initiation process is more slower and had the highest activation energy for thermal process .   152.10800523831588
And also E d for thermal was higher than E d for redox than E d or a photochemical process .   203.94418784479592
So , between this three processes thermal process redox process and photochemical processes .   653.7638311105237
In case of molecular weight , again similar order , the molecular was getting dropped or reduced with increasing temperature mostly for thermal initiated reaction then for redox reaction and for photo chemical reaction because E d is actually 0 .   398.7433590206818
It was actually going up mildly .   255.6040272052639
And we from this expression we know that every temperature ; typically what we do in a in lab you actually start a reaction say in a beaker or in a round bottom flask and keep in a oil bath maintained or in some other maintained in a constant temperature .   378.33946179151667
Now , each temperature you can consider , your reaction temperature you can consider as a ceiling temperature .   21.49347519660362
And typically , for the monomers which we know undergo polymerization process , this equilibrium value of the free monomer concentration is very low .   16.829922306894925
So , we consider we assume that the polymerization is easy and polymerization undergo the monomers undergo almost quantity polymerization or convert almost nearly hundred percent .   634.9270911572019
If we increase the temperature of your reaction then what happens , M e goes up .   20.046526397092062
So , if you choose to do in a higher temperature then you will always land up in a higher amount of unreacted monomer even if your reaction is complete or reached equilibrium .   109.72174797314105
69 degree the free equilibrium concentration of the equilibrium concentration the free monomer alpha methyl styrene was equal to the pure monomer concentration .   63.57615872742995
So , they do not take part or contribute too much in the delays value of polymerization , is basically that translational entropy drop for the monomers and which practically does not depend on the monomer structure .   94.70702242556875
Now , del S and del G 0 .   4.798030646639508
So , let us compare between this two values .   14.086679336131112
Now , del S del H in this case is for pure monomer .   26.108976252909454
Pure monomer is getting converted to a pure polymer which is completely amorphous or slightly crystalline .   27.821554386363903
Now , let us compare the values between few monomers and see whether how the monomer structure contribute to the values of , now the simplest monomer is ethylene and in case of ethylene this is from a pure gas to a polymer solid polymer .   185.27405770907546
This is 93 kilo g per mole and this is 155 , compare this with this vinyl acetate .   139.2771309459692
The gas gaseous monomer is getting transferred to a polymer .   41.45383770856785
This is minus 88 minus 110 , acrylonitrile minus 76 minus 109 , methyl acrylate 78 , M M A minus 56 , propane minus 84 , one butyne minus 84 , isobutylene minus 48 , two more styrene minus 73 and alpha methyl styrene minus 35 .   1010.2204948536015
This is minus 100 , minus 104 , 121 .   11.839750841200312
Now , as I said that this will be definitely higher because you are talking about a gas phase reaction or gaseous molecules is converted to a solid whereas , this case it is all liquid monomer you are talking about .   73.38215415445826
Obviously this alpha methyl styrene have a much lower del H value .   13.075223315079063
Resulting polymers is have much higher strain compared to if there was no such bulky groups .   48.57727907014974
So , as a result alpha methyl styrene has much lower del H value compared to the styrene .   23.594726591871304
Similar case for M M A , M M A also a one one substituted and same logic can apply here because these are resulting a strain polymer the del H actually .   277.1511097674701
You can compare between the values between M A and M M A .   52.35988056405783
If we compare between M A and M M A they are very close .   47.58228010377247
They are close , but M M A is having much lower because in case of one one substituted the strain is much more compared to if have a only one substituted monomer .   144.89297642729537
And this case presence of electron withdrawing C N group this will be more stabilized .   273.07745646411047
So , anything you do to stabilize the double bond it will lower the magnitude of the del H p .   45.7233137325825
If you do anything which will increase the strain in the resulting polymer that will also reduce the decrease in the value of del H .   43.37564322226553
Obviously one tribu butyne has much more stabilization .   48.58487089854555
Actually can form hydrogen bonding between the molecules which actually stabilizes the molecules lower compared to be when it get converted to polymer .   95.76286712543212
So , we talked about the stabilization of the monomer due to resonance , inductive effect or by hydrogen bonding or dipro interaction between the monomers and increase in the strain behavior of the resulting polymer , which all this factors are against thermodynamic feasibility because the del H value comes down .   104.17325108934088
So , this actually goes down because chlorines are induced lot dipole movement .   456.00863183415316
So , there could be a attractive interaction between the polymer molecule .   11.497772596058175
So , having a knowledge of del H is very important for a chemical engineer .   70.5237796712053
So , that it he can design a process whereby he can effectively remove the heat generated due to the polymer reaction so that reaction remain isothermal during the polymerization process .   142.49217628910662
So , this alpha methyl styrene has a minimum of del H value .   14.805819641352599
So , if it this goes down T c also goes down .   34.5526986093454
If you consider this as a pure monomer , if you fix this concentration pure monomer as this goes down T c goes down .   68.89479870736288
So , which means that for a pure monomer T c is much lower for alpha methyl styrene compared to a styrene which means that alpha methyl styrene cannot be polymerized .   65.68742761369022
We talked about in the initial lectures when we introduced the radical polymerization about five six lectures back .   158.7877114816944
For example , if you consider say maleic anhydride , stilbene or say one two simply one two dichloroethylene .   354.2656899176103
It is not due to its magnitude its value of del H polymerization .   134.6687208997055
Now , what is the reason that this monomers are difficult to polymerize ?   12.13959031396222
That is because of you if you have say polymer , a monomer like this where you have substituted one two substituted and you have a radical , if radical approaching this double bond which gets very restricted because of this substitutions .   226.12561920395171
What is the radical ?   7.061938495067765
It is generates when it propagate at the end is basically C H to Y C H to C H Y and so on .   235.8544828817371
Now , when this has to further take part in polymerization it has to approach this monomer .   101.9858487900004
Now , that so we talked about the T c and the values of del H and del S .   10.106221748106444
If the change in d R p says del V star by R T , we can write similarly , activation energy in case of temperature .   104.298470971847
You can write activation volume in case of pressure depending up on the value of this activation .   63.4902369146888
Activation volume is the change in volume from either monomer goes from monomer state to transition state .   107.94391211135316
If the volume of the transition state is higher than the monomer volume then del V activation volume will be positive .   61.75888012306718
You can get it from this expression and it is not very significant .   8.507509681533394
We , the effect of pressure is not that significant for addition polymerization .   52.64317388557202
Now , let us talk about , we will not spend too much time on the effect of the pressure on the rate of polymerization and molecular weight because it is not very significant as I said .   30.31583042871055
That effect of temperature is much more significant .   15.654083472382068
So , you can if you want to increase the polymerization rate you can do it much easier way by increasing the temperature .   23.21945974638339
If you run out of the option of increasing temperature then people try to increase the pressure to increase the rate of polymerization .   79.11034078022158
Now , let us talk about the molecular weight distribution in case of radical polymerization .   3.974501746708301
Now , again in case of radical polymerization , it is little complicated because the molecular weight forms during defined times of polymers are different .   88.67521849169887
Now , with time the value of M and I changes .   43.37229060604245
And changes means decrease , the mono monomer is converted to polymers .   148.46476066280636
Now , the drop in I is much sharper compared to drop in M concentration of M , which means that X n the average degrees of polymerization or the molecular weight increases with time .   37.026370679716365
One more fundamental difference in case of radical polymerization with the step growth polymerization , I spent some time in lecture probably couple of lecture back .   209.73514176508573
You consider the entire reaction mixture is the polymer , which includes monomers dimmer oligomers and high polymers high molecular weight polymers .   78.75044082347912
So , that entire mixture is your polymer sample .   71.6395032052699
So , the P D I you got one plus P which is for the entire polymer which includes small molecules as well as the high molecular weights .   48.81271181108108
We considered all the numbers all the molecules present in at the end of the polymerization which includes monomer dimmer oligomer and everything .   173.87355139367367
So , which which are considering the small molecules also as a part of polymers and we are getting the polydispersity of 1 plus 3 .   86.70344746351498
We discusses that during the polymers there could be cyclic reaction formation or the side reaction for which small molecular weight generate which which result in higher P D Ivalue of higher than 2 .   472.7563268047945
So , you are getting the polymer precipitate from your reaction mixture devoid of the small molecules .   75.12183511726143
So , basically you were narrowing your distribution .   176.42551636159783
So , you are getting less than 2 value if you have if you have a less than 2 value .   63.874620043792135
Now , in case of radical polymerization how do we define radical polymerization how do you define the X n is the total total number of monomers reacted , I hope it is all visible this is not very sharpen , by total number of polymer molecules .   66.44431737230141
Now , these are high molecular weight polymers these are high molecular weight polymers which you isolate after the reactions .   43.77557952418314
So , this does not contain the unreacted monomer .   95.34370207331922
What is the value of X n for radical chain polymerization ?   7.487172627905143
We will not go into very details into derivation .   88.60871169714048
Now , this case P is probability that the propagating radical will continue to propagate and build polymer .   17.71065514373804
What is the probability , is the probability given by the rates rate of propagation divided by total rates which is summation of propagation plus termination plus transfer .   151.90481667225163
Because , it is making high polymer high molecular weight polymer that means it is undergoing more times of propagating reaction than a terminating reaction or a transfer reaction which means probability is close to 1 .   170.58667516826063
So , X n is 2 by instead of 1 by 1 P is 2 by 1 p and X w is 2 plus P 1 minus P .   29.944398171357772
So , P D I is 2 plus P by 2 .   14.543505252756267
So , ration of monomer by I to the power half is this ration has not changed much , at low conversion it will not change much .   76.22061884829272
And as I said for high molecular weight polymer P is 1 .   8.513452014249598
So , the chain length the degrees of polymerization goes up .   9.495282076167111
And have if you increase the temperature .   5.877611008266702
if you increase the time the polymer molecular weight will be higher and higher .   8.5797737930756
So , you have a much more broader polymer distribution .   27.56915819702263
So , if you at the end of the polymerization if you consider the M w by M n value will be quite high and its typically between 2 to 5 .   22.956568441802396
You understand that a low conversion it is , it was between 1.52 to 2 , but at the temperature as the time goes up the polymer molecular weights increases increases .   101.78450120486625
So , that distribution actually goes up .   51.07133290010044
Starting from low molecular weight at the beginning to high molecular weights at the at the end thE distribution goes up .   85.799672077863
So , you typically the value of P D I comes around 2 to 5 .   32.504120167274706
And if there are gel effect effect like gel effect and all this things were molecular weight shoots up at the end because the reason we talked about in the last class it could end up a P D I value of 5 to 10 .   71.82336056813082
If intermolecular chain transfer happen then the P D I goes up further .   40.81260586726923
So , if the there are branching happening because of inter molecular chain transfer as gel effect then P D I goes up and it could be as high as 20 to 50 .   130.7634735966652
Now , talked about how the polymers are done you know .   13.143042782107326
You can do the polymerization only with a monomer and we call it a bulk polymerization .   31.921814603271326
You can dissolve the monomer in a solvent and do the polymerization then it is named as solution polymerization .   79.03723360191208
And you can do the polymerization in emulsion as well .   13.458239869693012
As I said is the most simple or the simplest polymerization .   133.8118125560939
You have to take the monomer and a initiator which is soluble in the monomer .   22.427489185933766
So , you take the monomer you dissolve the initiator and heat the monomer to start the or to initiate the reaction .   80.10156061638848
And obviously , what is advantage here ?   74.39261820649588
If you remember that discussion we had just few few minutes .   88.44586114938411
But monomer actually , if you increase the monomer both the reaction rate and the molecular weight goes up and this is the maximum concentration you can do .   23.699902599088453
So , rate of polymerization molecule is high and because you are not using any other chemical solvents or other things this gives you high purity polymers and gives you minimum contamination of the product .   370.27118046233807
For example , because your concentration is very high even at low concentration even at low conversion the viscosity goes up because the medium viscous if the polymer is viscosity goes up .   66.42660727891862
And as the viscosity goes up you cannot start the reaction medium very effectively and if you cannot start you cannot dissipate the heat generated due to exothermic polymerization .   194.94443575897262
So , viscosity becomes high and stirring become difficult .   85.69662270613406
And at the end of the polymer also polymerization also , if the viscosity of the resulting you are your final polymer is very high then processing also becomes very difficult .   74.0527963364869
It is still utilized for say making styrene , poly styrene , poly methyl acrylate , poly vinyl chloride .   377.9734341698581
Then stop the reaction take out the polymer and restart the reaction again .   21.50657673879094
So , that you can get high molecular weight , high rate of polymerization without building very high viscosity .   31.61589916449487
So , you have to do actually stop starts stop start stop reaction where you start the reactions stop at low conversion and then you stop and take the polymer out .   195.62473719185314
Another strategy is taken for making sheets and all this things that you make a pre - polymer which is not very high molecular weight .   30.966004138698903
So , you pour that pre - polymer into the sheet and then without starting you do the reaction .   296.12464519452743
So , you do not you are not aiming for processing this thing or you are not aiming for for heat management all this things .   367.8326988128973
You are not targeting that .   92.50837245203608
So , these are the things these are strategies are applied for in industry for using bulk polymerization .   156.80719677333664
We move to solution polymerization where you have require monomer solvent and a soluble solvent soluble initiator .   185.09877081063684
It could be homogeneous , if the polymer formed remain in in the solution it will be heterogeneous .   185.92504184571447
If the polymer is insoluble and precipitate out once it forms and once it precipitate outs it can form powder or granular .   195.00592119486487
For example , acrylonitrile in bulk or acrylonitrile in water in this case , it should be water .   221.07139889233687
If you start polymerization acrylonitrile in water , poly acrylonitrile is not solvable in water , so its precipitated out you get acrylonitrile powder or granular .   833.6517474714791
Obviously , advantage the advantage disadvantage which we had for your bulk polymerization .   156.96451435679077
So , there is no question of local heat formation , local spot formation , hot spot formation and degradation of molecules and thermal control becomes easier .   241.5691609504908
So , it is sometimes very difficult to take out all the solvents from the polymer quantitively .   91.32450450915957
And that is very detrimental for the properties of the you know final polymers , you do not want solvent to be contaminating your polymers .   88.59191687800487
Now of course , you cannot throughout all the solvents unit solvent recovery and recyclic which is a very hazardous for this .   383.064519289827
There is a third type of polymerization we talking about where is a heterogeneous polymerization it could be suspension or dispersion .   62.8896845194073
In case of , suspension monomer and monomer soluble water suspension polymers are nothing but bulk polymerization done in in small volumes .   83.13861536550864
You make this small volumes of bulk polymers distributed in a or dispersed in a aqueous solution .   138.52174122108593
So , all the disadvantage of the bulk polymers should not be present here because you are doing in a small small volumes and small droplets and because its present in a in a surrounded by aqueous medium .   93.50050748349847
What you do , you dissolve take your monomer dissolve the initiator in the monomer and then on that you add your dispersing medium which is already heated in the temperature you want to do your reaction .   104.25437698956816
So , you take the monomer along with your initiator you add the preheated dispersing medium and then reversely start .   218.36454991528797
So , that they remain in the as a dispersion form because you have this soluble water soluble polymers or the ionic particles which actually act as a stabilizer for this droplets .   118.77746527259802
So , what you do initially , you initiate is dissolved in the monomer and then preheated dispersing minimum added .   352.99313982498103
And vigorous starting converts the monomer containing initiator into strong small droplets of 100 to 500 microns , and because dispersant presence which are very small amount 0.1 weight percent .   927.780010434178
Now , you have the monomer droplets along with the initiator molecules has a small droplets which are dispersed in the aqueous solution .   22.031612375207864
That is why some times it call as a bead or a pearl polymerization .   169.91199773918586
So , you can remain maintain all the advantages of the high polymer bulk polymerization and you can get the polymers by filtration as a beads .   120.07304794933104
It should be rigid if you want to isolate these polymers as a bead then it should be rigid and it should not stick to each other .   48.04633502917394
Now , that happens if your polymer glass transition is is way above your room temperature .   103.7133669148236
So , we will start from this point and talk about the dispersion polymerization and emulsion polymerization in the next lecture .   16.783401624834067
Today we shall discuss the performance of enzyme catalyzed reactors , the reactors in which enzyme catalyzed reactions are supposed to take place.You will recall earlier we had discussed some of the salient features of different reactor types ranging from batch reactors , batch stirred tank reactors to continuous stirred tank reactor or plug flow reactors and fluidized bed reactors .   131.34268461269457
We had also seen earlier the factors that affect the choice of different reactor types and to recall some of the factors that we had talked about the most important ones are listed here like form of the enzyme .   154.41328992501616
That is soluble , fibrous or particulate .   868.8900607510875
The nature of the substrate whether it is soluble , particulate or colloidal , operational requirements ; the control of pH in case an acid is produced or consumed in the reaction , reaction kinetics , carrier loading capacity , catalytic surface to reactor volume ratio , mass transfer characteristics , ease of catalyst replacement and regeneration , reactor cost and ease of fabrication .   814.8517150082822
All these factors that I have listed here can be considered mainly under two categories .   133.42558212934895
One category contains the factor which becomes fixed once an immobilized enzyme is prepared .   396.5755057353731
The operational requirement is also fixed depending upon the nature of the enzyme catalyzed reaction whether an acid is produced or consumed and pH control is a requirement .   82.89003820073152
Similarly the catalytic surface to volume ratio is also fixed once an immobilized enzyme preparation is available .   199.91877019810065
Ease of catalyst replacement and reactor cost and ease of fabrication are the factors which are dependent on the type of enzyme reactor .   108.28657537420506
Last time I was taking we had also considered certain idealized reactor design parameter .   316.8739778211616
Either it is a plug flow motion or it is a completely back mix and nothing in between .   70.18539578806637
That is what we have assumed and there are no mass transfer limitations and no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase .   13.056070195644152
That means the parameter which we should define initially before we go on to design any particular reactor was “tau ” , the space time in the reactor ; initial substrate concentration , enzyme loading , E0 .   269.7206366662722
In the case of continuous operation , the information about the deactivation rate constant is also required , kd .   66.79736566433311
Ultimately the performance will be dictated very heavily by enzyme kinetics .   83.14634790547842
The first and probably the most simplest reactors is the batch reactors .   23.718671403845228
The batch reactor can be used both for soluble enzyme as well as for immobilized enzyme.You can carry out a batch reactor in a stirred mode or in a packed bed mode with using total recycle and on the right hand side is the characteristic profile of the reaction species that is the substrate and product with reference to time .   87.68212190426357
The substrate concentration drops and ultimately depending upon the extent of conversion which we require , the product concentration increases .   34.58769442502479
You take material balance for one of the reaction species say substrate and make a material balance ; simplify it .   145.882398168828
Do mathematical steps and you will arrive at the reactor performance equations which will give you the performance of reactor .   12.355261351261694
When I say performance of reactor I mean the extent of conversion as a function of space time or in a batch reactor with the reaction time .   47.887163058018615
Here in the case of a batch reactor the accumulation is volume multiplied by rate of change of substrate concentration that is –v.ds / dt .   53.97367331252719
Input and output here are taken as zero because there is no continuous input and output .   157.62684696691372
Only initially we feed the reactor and at the end of the reaction time the output is taken out .   28.00975989673199
This is equation 1 and this is equation 2 .   75.17991148137794
If you want to describe the equations in terms of reactor performance then X is equal to S0 - S X = = 1 - S / S0 ; S / S0 = 1 - X S0 So if you substitute all these parameters you get in terms of reactor performance equation for a batch reactor in the form of fractional conversion that is XS0 + K ’ mln 1 / 1 - X = k ’ 2E0t The reaction performance equation for a batch reactor if we want in the terms of product concentration , product concentration is nothing else but P = S0 - S assuming that its a unimolecular reaction .   88.12749012290705
If in case you are handling with a different kind of a reaction scheme let us say one mole of substrates goes into two moles of products then accordingly one has to make a change in the definition of X as well as P .   74.87894197453728
That means you take a single batch performance data ; take the maximum conversion at different times of reaction .   189.17223002365301
If you plot let us say ln ( S0 - S ) / S0 - S and t / S0 - S , you get the slope of k ’ 2E0 / K ’ m and with the intercept as - 1 / K ’ m Sorry .   82.96589683265148
X - axis is lnS0 / S .   52.14358250817027
When we immobilize enzymes if we monitor the kinetics parameters Km and vm , the simple way to measure the kinetic constants for an immobilized enzyme reaction will be to carry out the reaction in a batch stirred reactor .   65.51912750229289
Here I must again put a caution .   99.63933660067615
When we used the Michaelis Menten equation you will recall that we had made certain assumptions and the assumptions were that we are talking of the initial reaction rate .   21.44209066549326
That means at a time equal to zero .   14.533788958235093
So here we are violating some of the basic assumptions of the Michaelis Menten equation .   19.82517442484505
So when we apply the integrated Michaelis Menten equation for looking at the performance of an immobilized enzyme reactor in the batch mode we must keep in mind that it only gives you an approximate situation just to tell the sizing of the vessels required for a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction and to compare the soluble enzyme with that of immobilized enzyme performance .   120.34652455971069
Even while looking at the kinetics of the soluble enzyme we always look at the situations when it comes to extreme substrate conditions .   118.0435670715569
That means it ranges from first order to zero order regime .   13.082015719560768
XS0 = k ’ 2E0t If suppose you approximate an enzyme reactor to follow either a zero order or a first order regime , knowing the values of Km and k2 the error involved in that will be determined by the ratio of Km / S0 .   70.3498070030751
If the ratio of Km / S0 is very , very small you will hardly incur any error if you assume it to be a first order .   222.944081614235
When we go on to consider along with the reaction kinetics we consider mass transfer and all more complications we will tend to approximate our reactor performance in either zero order or first order regime rather than making it a Michaelis Menten equation which might make the solution of the expressions more difficult or it can be done by any numerical methods .   182.02079379239763
The error involved will increase if you increase the ratio of Km to S0 and you assume a first order because then both will go towards the zero order kinetics .   55.759344815018835
Km is much , much larger than the S0 in the first order .   14.318411332727727
So the value of Km / S0 will be larger .   19.20564481309026
Km / S0 will be large and under that condition you must assume a first order kinetics and if the value of Km / S0 decreases the error will continue to increase .   46.2834115009211
If you are going to measure let us say the value of Km or vm , you need an accurate value .   39.034629423059755
But when you want to go for design , let us say a reaction capacity ; what is the volume of the reactor required to carry out this conversion ?   57.78895063566599
You are not going to be very specific that this is the volume required .   39.470220090232104
So if let us say the error involved is less than 10 % , I think there is no harm in making an assumption of zero order or first order .   97.16497888954888
If the error involved is much larger then our assumptions will be slightly hazardous .   319.8598612769624
That means the feed rate of the substrate is same as the output rate of the product stream .   32.1683813009493
Substrate concentration S0 , changes at the exit .   169.03689329524133
But one of the characteristic features is that all the parameters at the exit stream are same as in the reactor itself .   28.5566795605877
That means the reaction will take place under conditions of S , P or X which exist at the exit stream .   46.769928705486905
Therefore if you just write a material balance for such a reactor system you can write accumulation as V.ds / dt = FS0 –FS – v.V FS0 is the input ; S is the substrate concentration in the outlet and v is the reaction velocity that is the conversion due to the reaction and V is the reactor volume .   135.55113738325363
When we say steady state situation it means that the concentration of any species does not change with time in the outlet stream .   49.191609491229045
There is no accumulation of any species in the system and therefore one can write k ’ 2E0S v = D ( S0 - S ) = K ’ m + S D is the term here what we understand as dilution rate or F / V or in other words V / F is the resistance time , inverse of space time .   119.86029229230434
So this D is the term and you can also write k ’ 2E0S S0 - S = K ’ m + S ?   35.205326111427745
Similarly here also if you make assumptions of zero order or first order situation when K ’ m is much , much smaller than S0 , that is a zero order system ?   32.40783763296742
= XS0 / k ’ 2S0 For first order system where K ’ m is much , much greater than S0 , you have K ’ m ( X / 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 ?   17.265703555350616
The expressions are very simple and if you have the data available for any reactor performance for S0 , fraction of conversion required , you can determine the volume of the reactor required or the feed rate required depending on the tau and one can make computation to define the reactor performance under given conditions .   115.80785415645693
So making a material balance across the reactor you cannot choose any concentration term because the concentration term for substrate changes with the length of the reactor and the concentration of the substrate or product is not constant throughout the reactor .   46.320586150551016
If you consider here input to the system is F.S and this input I am writing at the entry of the differential element and output , not at the entry of the reactor , is equal to F ( S + dS ) and the disappearance of the substrate by the reaction will be the continuation of the reaction to the disappearance of the substrate is –v. ( dV ) Under these conditions one can write the material balance under steady state assuming that the accumulation is zero .   145.2226029324115
/ S0 which is equal to zero to X dX / - v .   4.870598282316058
If you look at the performance of a plug flow reactor you ultimately arrive at or transfer the S0 to here so tau is equal to S0.dX / - v .   92.31176215000657
That is the reaction rate .   4.398163530173881
So the performance will be almost identical to that of a batch reactor excepting with the difference that the reaction time here is replaced by the space time and the reactor performance therefore on the same lines you can write as S0X – K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 e ?   73.05682823881438
That means the volume of the reactor occupied by the enzyme preparation is negligible compared to the total reactor volume whereas in the case of a packed bed a significant proportion of the reactor is occupied by the enzyme preparation .   25.77874501753117
I was just trying to define the term what I introduced here as epsilon .   234.22509363207493
In the case of a batch stirred reactor we have not considered epsilon because the quantity of enzyme or the volume of enzyme in the reactor is negligible compared to the total volume of the reactor .   27.621645981650683
On the other hand in the case of a packed bed reactor a significant fraction of the volume of the reactor is occupied by the packed bed and the volume occupied by the fluid or the feed substrate is only the wide volume of the reactor and therefore the volume occupied by the feed in the reactor is considered as the actual reactor volume .   29.264341124682602
So this gives you the reactor performance for a plug flow reactor following Michaelis Menten kinetics .   9.793082983895436
= XS0 / k ’ 2E0e For first order , tau is equal to ?   54.12414850892688
If the system doesn ’ t undergo substrate inhibition that is if it undergoes inhibition , we have no choice other than to using a lower substrate concentration .   213.87716260854643
So the only difference lies in the case of reactor performance of plug flow reactor .   8.622736443252805
In the case of PFR , the expression changes to K ’ m ln ( 1 - X ) = k ’ 2E0 e ?   18.139660127136228
Our interest will always be to have a high fractional conversion .   9.416380804781465
That means most of the substrates which is being fed gets converted into product .   37.79636275445909
If we want to compare the performance of both CSTR and PFR as I mentioned in the case of zero order regime there is no change and the performance remains identical .   27.499409899354127
You notice in this expression that higher the required conversion level , higher the relative amount of the enzyme required in the CSTR .   85.38388905371372
You take a simple value of 0.5 and if you make calculation for X = 0.90 , the Erel required will be equal to 4.5 .   124.73591180462483
That means the enzyme required for the same fractional conversion that is 90 % in the case of a CSTR will be 4.5 times more than that required in the PFR for the same conversion .   39.83662166604482
The same enzyme , the same reaction , the same conversion factor but the quantity of enzyme required in CSTR will be much , much higher compared to PFR .   24.454798334897415
If you change the fractional conversion to , let us say , 0.99 , the Erel value shoots up to 25 .   100.49516258968583
In case if the fraction of conversion required is very high if you are looking for a 99 % conversion , it will be desirable to use a plug flow reactor with a partial recycle .   21.48973904874023
As you notice here what ever I mentioned , it signifies the same thing .   112.98829978533166
Here instead of Km / S0 I plotted S0 / Km .   65.30634982636926
That means as the fractional conversion increases , the relative quantity required also increases and towards the final stages of the fractional conversion , the quantity very significantly goes up .   79.31058512562893
On the other hand you also see when you come to S0 / Km as hundred approaching towards zero order regime the quantities remain almost equal all through , till you arrive at 90 plus or more than 95 % fractional conversion .   230.0377527383001
But if you want to use a fraction of conversion much higher than 90 % then the PFR becomes more and more matter of choice .   48.69546129236282
Then the immobilization will be identical .   36.73628456794907
Your choice should depend upon the operational convenience .   144.37961128789135
If suppose the enzyme particles are in the form of fibers or spherical beads , it is easier to pack them rather than putting in the CSTR where there might be abrasion .   125.8203990014322
So the form of substrate and form of enzyme will dictate the choice .   35.78760107754123
The kinetics will not be dictating .   62.66580315155479
That means either a substrate inhibition or a product inhibition or a third inhibitor an external inhibitor available in that .   73.0042771147214
We have also not considered the deactivation of the enzyme on the reactor performance .   9.284086211849472
All these parameters particularly the inhibitors , rather their inhibition pattern , their deactivation pattern , the mass transfer requirements , the mass transfer limitations and the non - ideal flow behavior ; these are the four things .   149.7556618024825
They might be some kind of deviation from the ideality because of the packing characteristics or some channeling taking place or in laboratory you can very easily maintain a good plug flow reactor .   97.72419141118142
So all these issues we will take individually rather than compounding all of them because not that all the issues will be applied in a particular reactor system we will have to identify the issues which are important .   137.84213609454508
For example we identify let us say the mass transfer limitations are the most acute .   91.84311403898117
The system is mass transfer limited .   55.183443017473415
There is point to consider reaction kinetics ; you design your reactor system based on mass transfer diffusional requirements .   152.4706558969222
I think we will stop here and continue to discuss the behavior of enzyme reactors .   21.27924365434146
At the start I will be giving you a thorough introduction about the polymers which includes the classification , nomenclature and perspective of molecular of polymer molecules .   303.0423944424581
In the characterization , I will talk on detail about the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and then polymer chain dimensions , and I also will cover in detail about various methods for measuring molecular weight of polymer , polymers .   113.65604916746099
And then I will cover polymer , important polymer properties and how the structure of polymer molecules correlates to these properties .   110.3132659617089
I will also cover both the chemical structure as well as physical structure of the polymers and how it relates to the polymer properties .   69.19622142870016
I will cover in brief the reaction of polymers which include polymer degradation , stabilization and also polymer modifications and at the end I have planned to brief you about few new topics , and special topics and new development in polymer chemistry and at the end I will complete with a summary of this course .   427.2153222543077
Now , after learning what are the topics , we planned to cover in this course , let us introduce polymer to you , what are polymers ?   114.76202981381837
In a very simple term , in a single sentence polymers can be defined that they are large molecules that is why sometimes they call macromolecules synonymously .   233.45781724754792
They consist of many repeating structural units , the term polymers derived from Greek words poly and meros , poly means many and meros means part .   1607.7253592259133
So , you get a polymer for example you have ethylene here and in this side after polymerization you have polyethylene .   75.42009588642344
In this case all the monomers are same so we name these polymers ; we term these polymers as homo polymers .   109.80561781691037
To just give you a example of copolymers I have a say I have a molecule like styrene and I also have a molecule like methyl methacrylate .   21.06623769582884
Now , this two can be polymerized to give you a poly styrene co MMA , this is a copolymer of poly styrene and methyl methacrylate .   52.333463685726095
If if we have say more than one diol in this case ethylene glycol and say butylene glycol , that case we will have a mixture of two structure unit where you have terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and also a terephthalic acid and butylene glycol in this , that case we call this or we name this polymers as a copolymers .   68.4176066400498
To just repeat about this copolymers generally , we use the term copolymers where the polymer is synthesized form to different monomers where the monomers are or can be polymer individually .   199.08664112906587
There is another case where polymer is made from two different monomers , but in this case we do not call this as a copolymers , because the constituents monomer usually cannot be homo polymerized independently by the same process .   58.9928262724876
And when you make polymerization polymers , we invariably land up in distribution of molecular weight while a polymer is a high molecular weight , but it also gives you a distribution of molecular weight that means it has several length , the polymer mixture is consist of different molecular weight chains and this is , this high molecular weight of polymer which gives you or which enables a polymer to have this useful properties where , for which the polymer is known for for example , it gives you high tensile strength impact resistant , toughness , melt viscosity and and so on .   95.89337221543695
Now , you might ask me why and what is the reason this high molecular weight help in giving the , a polymer this superior properties compared to this small molecules .   209.8531677761865
This is individual colors ; individual chains represent a individual molecules in this case as well .   139.71608715142102
So , given a stress from outside they can be separated easily , in other word these small molecules behave independently .   311.0873263092227
If I just give you a example of real life , say I have taken a bowl of rice and you want to take out rice with a spoon , you can easily take out because each individual rice units behave independently .   155.23781936624206
So , in this case where it was very easy to deform or set up small , mixture of small molecules in this case because of the large molecules it is difficult to deform a polymer molecules which gives you high viscosity , which gives you the high strength of the polymer molecules , high impact resistant , toughness and all other good properties of molecular polymer samples and that is why polymers is so popular now a days .   204.40168328178572
Okay , coming to the more definitions relevant to our course of polymer chemistry as such .   162.42503051874613
So , for making a polymers you require monomers which have at least two functionality in them .   104.00154387655373
In this case this is the unit which is repeated which means and this is called , this is the repeat unit for polystyrene case .   46.08977210494298
Now , if I go back the example I gave in the few minutes back , in this case for example , for polyethylene terephthalate this is the unit which is represented in the bracket .   42.92626199193685
We talk about oligomers .   13.486833720870818
Oligomers are you know during the process of polymer synthesis , you get the small chain units which are consist of 2 monomers , 3 monomers , 4 monomers and so on , dimer , trimer , tetramers and these are called or termed as oligomers .   307.5799710660773
Now , you can ask me till when , till what time we call a molecule as a polymer or oligomer ?   265.5100603254491
Whether it is after 10 , 11 , 12 , 20 , 50 , 100 you know after how many repeat units , you call a polymer as a polymer and before that you call as a oligomer .   135.5674948051015
Now , it depends it depends upon different polymers , the easiest way to think a molecule , a long molecule as a polymer not a oligomer if you add another unit repeating unit or you take out another unit and by doing this addition of one unit or taking out all unit , if the property of the polymer or the molecule does not change you call it as a polymer , but if change significantly then you still call it as a oligomer and that will depend on the chemical structure of the polymer .   236.26428349861533
So , some cases if you increase from a repeat unit number from 20 to 21 or decrease from 20 to 19 you might see there is a change in the property , you cannot call that chain as a polymer you have to call that as a oligomer , whereas in some cases some some cases you do not see any changes say after 20 to make 20 to 21 and 20 to 19 then you call that as a polymer .   97.41255935328937
So , in this case number of repeating units RU repeating units is same as number of structural units SU is structural units .   40.96386524486561
Whereas , in this case , case of polyethylene terephthalate individual monomers which are coming here and making the polymer they are called structural units .   78.72739894006642
In this case number of repeat units is actually half of the number of structural units .   20.93806250815779
So , when you define degree of polymerization it is the number of structural units not the number of repeat units present in a polymer .   21.140623627279407
So , in this case if the molecular weight of of each styrene , molecular styrene is m and you have a polymer with n number of repeat units same as structural units then molecular weight of this polymer would be m multiplied by n .   82.53086183040584
Now , what happened in this case ?   4.568111419830437
In the case of PET .   19.54989135369777
For example , if I take the molecular weight of this as m 1 and this as m 2 then how do you get the polymer molecular weight ?   18.34868680147366
How do you define ?   4.889300442583229
So , let us see whether it get clarified to you in this cartoon .   132.65058105349425
Now , before going forward let us clarify one thing in a more often or not you know in commonly polymers are referred as plastics .   344.80302509273
Now , there is certain difference between the term plastics and polymer .   114.23979665395441
Polymers are the molecules which we synthesize from the monomer , they are individual molecules or a mixture of molecules , but we do not use when you synthesize a polymer from , in the lab or in a plant we do not use , in a seldom use as the polymers as synthesized .   91.84535305213936
In most cases what happened we add some additives like pigment , stabilizers and then process that polymer mixture , you know polymer with the mixture to turn this polymer into a practical product .   447.1208400009144
So , if I talk about pet bottle when you synthesize pet in the lab and that is not a plastic material or when you take a pet molecule poly terephthalate molecule in the plant and then mix with the stabilizer and other things and form that bottle , that is called plastics .   201.88392189169443
So , when you talk about you know , but in commonly , in common man whatever they see is applications of polymers , they see in daily life is a plastic , you know applications are visible as a plastics application .   640.4660346694388
So , that is this common term that is why this common term is appearing .   175.50675949468766
If you think yourself or if you read magazines and talk to the older people then you will find that in last century whatever new material development has happened polymers will rank as one of the top .   825.1130553244675
So , in last century polymer is one of the biggest success in terms of new material development and as a results more and more applications are existing or coming up where this polymers are replacing the conventional materials like metals , glass , wood and so on for example , I am wearing a spec .   1282.3104997041412
Now , earlier , few years back for a decade back or so this spec was used to be made from glass , but now a days you will hardly find any spec is made up of glass , they are all made up of either polycarbonates or the cheaper ones are formed acrylics .   1336.0739040321591
So , I have , hope you are convinced that polymers are you know a useful material and replacing the conventional materials .   94.03558493038187
There are hundreds of polymer goes in those applications .   14.691506215992977
Talk about a oxygenator which is used during a heart , open heart surgery or talk about applications in car head lamp , aircraft windows and and several high end applications like very high capacity DVDs .   645.858093923609
Now , why why people use polymer compared to this conventional materials or traditional materials ?   196.86585015939824
There are definitive , there are some definitive advantages for example , I just gave you example of the spec .   501.21087926509995
This is one of the most important advantages of using polymers which gives you excellent strength to weight ratio .   121.1536968263979
It gives you design flexibility , you know there are and also various you know the option of giving you modern styling you know .   424.29471909760355
Polymers are most cases thermal insulator which makes it or enables polymers to use in electronic industry and unlike the conventional materials like wood , metal they are optically clear which enables application of polymers in media , and optical devices and one more important that there are so many polymers available in market that you can choose a definite polymer for your particular applications .   432.0358272592157
Some polymers are of course , very costly , that gives you very good performance , but more often not the polymers gives you , comes with a lower cost .   179.99153619091635
Now , before I come to the introduction of polymers or polymer chemistry , I just want to give you a big picture , a view on the top , a bird ’ s eye view from how you look at polymers .   92.94483003272983
You know different stages , life stages of polymers and how it get transformed where they induce of polymers .   256.79257093250163
Sometimes , it come other form as well like in emulsions .   504.344807983352
So , if it is solution you have to take out the polymers from the solution in a powder form and if it is in a bulk or in a melt form you can use as such and if it is in emulsion cases like some cases it is in emulsion .   96.52400748031035
So , in most cases to find a polymer , these polymers are synthesized in a plant from raw materials which are monomers by the process , which are termed as polymerization .   55.108203739421185
So , you have polymers which you can get from natural source , but in majority of places a polymer is synthesized from raw materials , monomer by process called polymerization .   199.5204858728583
How , where from do you get this monomers or the raw material ?   35.03259938458591
As I said most cases synthetic polymers are prepared or synthesized from monomers which are derived from petroleum resources .   118.91297650218867
Now , you have to take the polymers towards application side .   84.35813440101683
There are minority of polymers are taken to the applications where polymers are used along with the other ingredients like in detergents .   100.81195013044203
If you talk about say eye drop you have polymer in aqueous solutions with salt and other ingredients .   179.5110392742347
So , in that case what is done the polymers as comes out from plant is taken to a step , taken through a step , a polymer processing step which are commonly called compound where the polymer either in a melt form or in powder form is mixed with the required additives or property enhanced enhancing fillers or sometimes with other polymers as well to make polymer blends and you get a intermediate product , is like pellets .   420.4082308811626
And once the polymer and this pellets are supplied to the equipment manufacturer , they do a processing steps to give you or to give the final shape , design fabrication step or in a finishing shape and you get the final products which gives you the , which goes into the final applications .   186.8001805914813
I will give examples which will clarify these points more in , once the final application is done the , this life cycle of the polymers does not end .   151.40842231510535
If it is a solution you have to take out the polymers as a powder form .   27.550724779746403
In minority of application this polymers are taken and added to other ingredients like the examples I gave in detergents , but in major cases the polymer is mixed with the other ingredients like additives , pigments , stabilizers and it is by a process called polymer processing , compounding and you , it is transformed with granules or flakes or pellets to form intermediate product .   769.6759751035315
How this , how the polymer industry works ?   10.24024070265152
Now , if we talk about the big polymer manufacturers like DuPont , Dow Chemicals , SABIC , Bayer they are manufacturer of polymers .   631.4385273146661
They get the monomers from other source or they might make themselves as well and they , after making the polymers in the plant they also do this steps themselves , from this intermediate product .   367.90216659363693
And then sell it to some original equipment manufacturer which do this processing step , molding step to make the final product , which goes into the final applications .   92.76763506726046
This BPA molecule , this is produced from phenol and acetone and this is produced from coke getting oxidized to carbon monoxide which one react to it chlorine gives you phosgene .   1011.8651360475211
It comes from cumin plus acetone .   150.20293687228497
This comes from petroleum products , which is eventually coming from crude oil .   160.45180193551448
Let us just go back to earlier page and repeat this .   56.372591402870874
They make this process definitely , they make or they synthesize the polymer in the , polycarbonate in the plant them self .   352.1045261257497
They can source the monomer at any stage , they can buy BPA and phosgene , they can buy phenol and make BPA them self or they can buy a cumin and they make and they can phenol from which they can make BPA and and then PC .   987.2126756307646
They also do this step , this step compounding step them self .   451.08396079679176
This original equipment manufacturer buy this pellets , polycarbonate pellets from any of these big companies and they mold it to , they mold it to give a form of a head lamp cover which they then supply and sell it to a car manufacturer who assemble these head lamp along with other things and have this product in the market .   761.3727151071404
So , this gives you idea about a different stages of polymers and how the industry work .   36.74713507524099
There are some smaller industries which make custom polymer products .   449.1568554780517
These are the examples of big polymer industry where the the companies make the polymers in very large quantity , where the the applications where polymers find you know minor like examples I said where polymers are synthesized and added as a active or secondary ingredient in other formulations , those polymers are typically made by the smaller companies and they are taken , they are synthesized by the smaller companies .   515.5689651901608
So , current focus in polymer research is to make monomer and subsequent polymers from a natural sources , which could be a bio source or a source which can be renewed or the source by by renewal resources .   496.6897451464044
There is a focus also make this polymerization process green and environmental friendly where you avoid use of this toxic chemicals and gases like solvents and other things .   945.2356820119612
There is also emphasis of making new polymers of complicated structures which will find applications in newer especially in medicines and also this this is a continued research interest where you take existing polymers and add additive fillers , new additive fillers or different processing step , now improve processing include polymer processing where you you make this different improved application of or newer applications of the existing polymer .   1188.661412088379
We also learned why we should study polymers , polymers as you by now convinced that find applications in conventional applications as well as very newer applications , very high end applications and we also learned why nowadays polymer is used more and more applications , what are the good properties of polymers and why polymers are different , you know why polymers are get what what are the structural features of polymer gives you this is improved properties and then we also learned big picture .   486.2355906132478
So far we have been talking about the kinetics of single substrate enzyme catalyzedreactions and as we all know that in the living cells a large variety of enzymes interact with the multiple substrates .   49.95816913063023
In a living cell the concentration of the two substrates that are to interact with the enzyme may be almost in an equal or near by concentration levels .   108.51886809434284
They may not be extremely different and therefore it is necessary to look at the actual effect of the bi - substrate reactions on the reaction rate .   47.05122329858657
Two of the examples which I have chosen here are one on alcohol dehydrogenase which oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde involving a co - enzyme NAD and the other is hexokinase catalyzed phosphorylation of glucose or any other hexose to the corresponding phosphorylated sugar .   130.19955203362355
Most of the hydrolytic enzymes isomerizes or often can be analyzed using classical Michaelis Menten kinetics .   67.03025516744613
The oxidoreductases represented by the first reaction or a transferase represented by hexokinase or in many cases the lipases are the real true bi - substrate reactions which in general should not be treated or analyzed with the Michaelis Menten kinetics .   312.0835779211792
Basically that signifies that the dynamics of the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate molecule may be quite varied unlike in the case of Michaelis Menten kinetics where you have a single substrate and it has to bind on the active site of the enzyme molecule and form an enzyme substrate complex .   32.54563934301926
Here because the substrates are more than one there are many possibilities for interaction between the substrate and the enzyme molecules and so therefore these dotted figures indicate a variety of interactions that are involved .   49.17702658664879
A generalized rate expression for this was proposed by Alberty based on steady state hypothesis .   24.9990333645641
That is V0 = Vm.A.B Vm is the maximum reaction velocity where both the substrates A and B are in saturating concentrations .   96.49967178125537
Almost the same assumptions that we made in case of Michaelis Menten kinetics and the A and B can be to a saturating level providing a maximum reaction velocity .   60.20508675317006
The denominator term gives you another three kinetic parameters ; K ’ A is the dissociation constant of binding of E to A giving EA .   77.34732250689979
This is dissociation constant and KB and KA indicated here are the concentration of the substrates A and B respectively at which the reaction velocity is half the maximum reaction velocity at saturating level of the other substrate .   65.03265467601405
There might be some confusion about KA and K ’ A .   35.772046262468315
K ’ A is the dissociation constant for binding of A to the enzyme .   7.617686219758965
This distinction between the two will be more clarified or clear when we proceed ahead but such a situation exists in the case of bi - substrate reactions .   138.68748924346525
You will notice that the apparent Michaelis Menten constant will depend upon the concentration of the other substrate also and this dissociation does not depend upon the other substrate .   26.068021010734057
Out of the several mechanisms , in one of the mechanisms this K ’ A may be equal to K and the rate expression will accordingly get modified .   163.96943472117772
Under those conditions if you take the first expression you will notice that this can also be considered almost like as you mentioned earlier while looking at the validity of Michaelis Menten kinetics for bi - substrate reactions that if we put one of the substrate concentration in excess the expression can represent the bi - substrate reaction kinetically with respect to other substrate .   93.81600888836324
Similarly when A tends to infinity analogous expression will emerge V0 = Vm.B / KB + B So you get a similar expression in the case of excess concentration of or large concentration of one of the reactants and that was also the understanding we had when we discussed Michaelis Menten kinetics .   164.5673164950662
You can rearrange this general expression by taking certain factors and divide both and you can end up at the constant concentration of B .   264.3068606732373
You notice the relationship between the apparent Km for A and K ’ A .   30.08303831461788
Although they are related it also involves the concentration term of the other substrate which is B and a similar relationship like this when you consider constant concentration of A and the apparent Km for B .   173.30020443647598
Or in other words in a special case when K ’ A = KA ; Kmapp = KA The relationship between these two terms implies that when they are same as the Michaelis Menten constant with respect to A it does not interfere and K ’ A = KA .   43.62516998709161
It is with respect to first substrate binding .   36.81760007743672
Under this condition I am trying to give you an analogy or an explanation as to how KA and K ’ A are related .   183.1880531569695
If you consider the single substrate reaction the dissociation constant of substrate with the enzyme is analogous to Km value , whereas in the case of bi - substrate reaction that situation is not true .   35.651476647901575
That is only a special case of a bi - substrate reaction under which the Km apparent for B will become equal to KB when these two become equal .   64.73264104547444
Otherwise this value will be this magnitude although they will have a relationship but they will be a function of other substrate concentration .   71.65630347710236
That was the only assumption .   30.664400447600382
In the first case this should be KA .   30.566360441797002
You can also look at these expressions in a graphical mode and to have a better visualization .   124.15061649172938
In the first case when we are talking of constant B your profile will be something like this .   26.51781000012935
Similarly in the case of A constant you will have another Km value K ’ A.KB + KB.A Kmapp = KA + A Here also this is your constant A .   91.47741553987385
This will be a maximum reaction velocity when A becomes saturating .   20.36091836359072
Such a situation can be conceived as a simplification of Michaelis Menten system .   121.71130405053717
What will be the kind of the double reciprocal plot ?   7.235637440386905
In the case of a generalized rate expression one can just write 1 / V0 = ( 1 + KA / A + KB / B + K ’ A.KB / AB ) / Vm That is the double reciprocal plot if we divide both the numerator and denominator by A into B you will get rate expression .   66.41699578502487
If B increases you will get a slope of KA + K ’ A.KB / B Vm The intercept on this factor will be 1 + KB / B Vm So you will notice that both slope as well as intercept of the profiles will decrease as you increase the value of B and ultimately when this B become saturating it will be a typical K value for the substrate A .   196.8939436602519
Experimentally the magnitude of KA , KB , K ’ A and Vm can be determined by double reciprocal plot analysis .   39.16468756211976
Similarly here if you plot 1 / B versus the magnitude of slope you will get again a straight line with the slope equal to K ’ A.KB / Vm and intercept of KA / Vm .   70.43258149369018
You will notice that while looking at the generalized expression of the bi - substrate reaction rate expression we have not really bothered about the dynamics of enzyme substrate interaction .   50.88353201204912
The first form , the first complex formation can be considered as the random ternary complex formation .   32.34519309652545
When we are talking of enzyme and two substrates there is a quite logical choice that we might end up instead of binary complex , a ternary complex where E , A and B all the three are combined together before a product formation takes place .   232.127809414104
In the case of random ternary complex formation the enzyme can form binary complex EA and EB to start with and also the ternary complex EAB with no restriction on the order in which A and B bind to the enzyme .   66.03176456726518
You can express it in a mechanistic way the enzyme going to EA or EB and EAB and this four this will go in cyclic form .   311.189994883193
Either reaction can go in this direction or in this direction there is no constraint on the order of the ternary complex formation .   43.45616840134192
Another typical feature is that the kinetic parameters of the same enzyme which catalyses the same reaction from two different sources are different .   41.41054272517215
One of the reasons in such cases is based on the different reaction mechanisms that are involved .   12.25205697178118
Similarly yeast hexokinase also follows this kind of mechanism where the ternary complex formation is obtained .   61.37762004332213
They may be equal to in some cases or they may not be equal to because ultimately the multiplication of the two dissociation constant in reaching to EAB will be same .   73.68975885628419
But we have just put the different rate constants .   26.31946129526207
The second case again with respect to ternary complex formation is ordered ternary complex formation .   33.56516144627374
In other words if you write down the reaction mechanism EA this is k1 , k - 1 and then this will go to EAB and this is k2 and k - 2 .   27.495269079808224
The process in this direction is not feasible .   16.82858207549432
A typical example of the ordered ternary complex formation as I mentioned is liver alcohol dehydrogenase which is obtained in the mammalian systems and also lactate dehydrogenase is another example of ordered ternary complex formation .   50.835256262868114
You can see that the same alcohol dehydrogenase can follow different mechanisms .   92.08536182639469
A special case of ordered ternary complex formation when B reacts with EA ; the order is important .   96.7872326811764
We can only react with enzyme only when A has bound to it to form and one of the products is released and the modified enzyme substrate complex is generated .   44.609176027317446
That means a modified enzyme substrate complex is generated and a first product has been released without the formation of a stable ternary complex of kinetic significance .   240.96477540567676
Such a kind of a system where although the second substrate B reacts with EA to give you the first product and the ternary complex is not a very stable entity is classified into the Thorell and Chance mechanism .   51.49031775508942
A typical example of such a reaction is glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase which you also come across in the case of glycolysis .   101.31827906046975
The second substrate has to interact with the binary complex before the first product can arrive at but the stable intermediates are only EA and EY .   183.51730975860812
You will also notice that in many books it is written as Ping - Pong bi - bi mechanism .   66.19856474507753
The term bi - bi refers to substrate and product .   40.293724564121064
Bi - bi means two substrates and two products .   147.18235157720693
In case of many of the ligases the situation may be bi - uni .   405.19382311280947
All those cases are clubbed under Ping - Pong mechanism and in this case of Ping - Pong mechanism the basic hypothesis is that no ternary complex is formed .   48.65473514457325
As soon as the first substrate binds to the enzyme it can react to form the B to form a product or it can split off to a product E .   52.17918712371594
You will notice that the two things like Thorell and Chance mechanism and the Ping - Pong mechanism in some way might show analogy .   73.94741691919064
EA ’ then interacts with B to give you EA ’ B and then this gives you a product again which is Y with k3 and k4 .   100.387841479193
