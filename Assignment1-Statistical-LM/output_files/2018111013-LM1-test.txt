Even though not all might be taking the advice of psychiatrists or psychologists.   147.58247935787247
But the number of patients coming to the psychiatrist and psychologists today has increased much than earlier.   76.90366426042505
In the pomp of multimillion advertisements of modern medical science perhaps very few people will accept the truth that methods of effective treatment of common mental problems and severe psychological disorders are present in the ancient Indian medical science , that is , Ayurveda.   130.83142924113727
The Nij disorders are those which occur due to the imbalance of tridisorders gas , bile , cough.   50.13054217718848
In Ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy.   82.50386709325252
The meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body.   32.527883266700435
If the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected.   42.78899205661984
Healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body.   107.07476551321395
There are three properties of man - saatvik , rajasik and tamasik , these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it.   89.34513887013185
According to few specialists , the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire , pride and intelligence.   149.65450944758643
Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all.   52.73645525051101
With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders.   70.67763328145703
According to Dr.Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body.   55.33555562529461
Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders.   34.297481902121554
One main cause for occurrence of mental disorders for any person is also not being able to strike a proper balance with his surroundings.   71.6361505095977
In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc.   429.83564499244113
If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc.   165.43250210305746
The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now.   84.90719731695899
In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain.   27.13367765346241
Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice.   157.90734217461227
After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery.   69.12056880283926
He had also heard something about hernia.   67.39164023898522
According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc.   42.822872929480624
Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur.   203.08998587095803
The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct.   119.54201226807949
After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away.   343.2824244895964
It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan.   31.359329368049288
Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach.   58.22670490021429
That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach.   33.98244649750637
The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia.   40.13064085070518
It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction.   33.728990717722276
The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common.   17.040183333338295
Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia.   44.3331220514374
If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years.   58.871280283785545
This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child.   10.084023924745738
In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth.   23.32195724265924
But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak.   24.85893203301688
Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high.   55.49856250537
Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high.   85.78116953512917
