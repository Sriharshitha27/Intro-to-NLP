Now , in this lecture I plan to cover discuss the general characteristics of ionic chain polymerization , and while discussing I will compare how this ionic chain polymerization compares with radical chain polymerization .   2.275456078541066
And then we will go to cationic chain polymerization and talk about different types of initiation for cationic chain polymerization , and then go to propagation and termination reactions in cationic chain polymerization .   3.18268406658946
And then I will talk about kinetics of cationic chain polymerization and then energetics of cationic chain polymerization .   2.760439180698086
Now , let us begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization .   2.3190641389898357
Now , as the name suggest , in this case the initiation is from an anionic species , whether it is a cation or anion .   3.364185719814622
It could be acceptance of electron giving rise to a radical anion or removal of an electron , which gives to radical cation , which two of which might combine to give you a dianion or a dication which can further initiate the chain reactions from both the sides .   1.9729773003735567
This is a case of cationic polymerization and this two are the case of anionic polymerization .   5.006639040145973
Now , in this case , the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species , so as the propagating species also ionic .   2.554447936547863
Now , like radical chain polymerization , these ionic chain polymers , polymerization reactions are not very popular commercially .   2.4142391613386907
One is that stringent requirement of polymerization in case of this ionic polymerization .   3.363159765634674
We require very , stringest , stringent conditions , which are difficult to achieve in a large industrial scale and also , this ionic polymerization are very selective , which means , that not every monomer can be polymerized by ionic polymerization , unlike , unlike radical case where most of the , poly , monomers , double bond monomers can be polymerized by radical chain polymerization we can assume .   2.582722088364141
So , these are the main two reasons why this ionic chain polymerization , are not practiced that commercially in that scale .   2.203438541014844
And so in that sense , it is not that important like radical chain polymerization .   3.045723388670955
First is that as I just said , that it is , it is much more selective , much more selective .   2.898160715442673
Now , for anionics , for anionic chain polymerization we need to have monomers , which have electron withdrawing group , electron withdrawing group , which could be , as we discussed earlier , something like this , acrylates or methacrylates , and , and so on , with this can be polymerized anionically because the resulting anion can be stabilized by this resonating with the carbonyl bond .   2.8821459334602344
So , in that sense , this anionic and cationic polymerization at very and only if the monomer has , monomer with , monomers with , with inductive effect and ability to stabilize the propagating species by resonance in the , both for cationic and anionic , then this monomers can be polymerized by both cationic and anionic .   2.312567086336652
For example , you have styrene where both cationic and anionic can be stabilized by resonance with this aromatic proof or say , cation , resulting cation or anionic can be stabilized by resonance from this double bond .   2.0575216117087076
While in case of radical we have seen , that all this , this monomers or this monomers or this can be all polymerized by radical chain polymerization .   2.994308075003467
So , in that case , in that composition radical is a , radical chain polymerization is much least sensitive compared to the ionic polymerization .   3.0133168483398807
It is not only polarity , but the capability of the solvent molecules to solvate the ionic species giving the chain propagation .   2.6532044935621317
Now , as you have seen earlier , that a propagation reaction can be this .   3.048336113628371
It is either cationic species or anionic species .   2.302846204377296
Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion .   2.6108585025845814
So , this propagating chain are always of this ionic group , are always accompanied by a counter ion of oppositely charged , that is always happens .   2.075964944708256
Now , depending on the association behavior of these two species , the active center and the counter ion , the reactivity of the propagating species varies .   2.9092746521481274
What I mean , that if they are very tightly bound , they are very tight , then obviously , the accessibility of , or the reactivity of this ionic center are less .   3.1327698400914867
So , the propagating species is less reactive .   3.5934043931817734
While if you compare with the situation where they are well separated , they are like free , free hands .   2.330451144633262
Now , if they are free , then obviously , they are more accessible and the reactivity of this propagating species , ionic propagating species are much more reactive or much more reactive compared to situation when they are tight ion - pair .   2.8405511128296808
So , it is always preferred , that you have a polar solvent , it is , this is always preferred .   4.222253487552123
So , you have a higher rate of reaction or an eventually higher molecular build up .   3.277697491966204
Now , often if you use polar solvent , for example if you use hydroxylated solvents , hydroxylated solvents like say , H 2 O or alcohol , what happens ?   2.326009402855942
This , this reacts , this hydroxylated solvents react very , very fast , you know , very effectively they react with this ionic species and then stop the chain .   1.9636562054010307
So , you do not have an effective polymerization happening .   2.5930831051682115
So , eventually or practically , a low to moderate polarity solvents like , say methylene chloride or say , methylene dichloride or THF , or ether or nitrobenzene .   1.4976265592389861
They , they actually can be used for ionic species polymerization , but this is , these are not very generic in the sense , that the solvents , this solvents also can react with anionic species as well .   2.7862514793199997
So , we have , we will discuss specifically for the requirement of solvent .   3.2887360145823794
We will talk about cationic and anionic polymerization individually .   2.7909896337176336
Now , how this , if you want to write a , a generic structure of , say , to write , write a cationic propagating species , which have , which a cationic reactive centre and a counter ion , which is represented by A minus , so what are the possible states they can represent ?   2.456947968070966
One , they can be completely covalent bonding , covalent bonded , covalent bonded , one .   1.8288377810607463
So , tight ion - pair or sometimes it is called contact ion - pair or see , some people say intimate ion - pair .   2.0459716123483767
It can be present as solvated .   3.322782546915162
So , solvated has three solvated ion - pair or loose ion - pair or they can be totally free , free ion - pair .   2.0780019158006136
So , these are the possible , depending upon the polarity of the medium this could the four possible association state between these two ionic species .   2.3655934692170972
Now , it , we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is B plus , is said the both cationic polymerization , the propagating species in cationic polymerization .   2.114975601465314
But it can be true ; this post can be true for the other anionic polymerization as well .   2.5643025932959733
So , which means and in some cases these , these are not present isolately , they actually remain in equilibrium and equilibrium shifts depending upon the polarity of the medium .   2.1771404090417934
And if you compare with radical chain polymerization , solvent polarity actually has no such role to play in case of radical chain polymerization .   2.6140194256983014
You have to only check whether the solvent can solubilize the monomer or the reagent and it , solvent should not participate in the undesired chain transfer reactions .   2.356994579842556
So , this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization .   2.716299479279837
So , third characteristic we can talk about and compare the nature of reaction .   2.1533220583878405
Now , this , these are complex reactions as we will find out from further discussion , that these are complex reaction and they are very fast .   3.2726573262094107
So , they are very fast and this fast nature of this reaction is due to the fact , that the accumulation of this active centers .   3.04102900035208
One cation cannot react with another cation , cationic propagating species and terminate the reactions in case of radical .   2.4878372568955345
But in case of radicals we have seen , that the steady state concentration of the active radicals is very low and as a result , the propagation was comparatively low in a slower , in compression to these ionic polymerization .   3.074872456605776
Cocatalyst are nothing but small inorganic compounds , like say H 2 O , can be observed in case of ionic polymerization have , which was not the case of radical polymerization .   2.361072436810648
And as I said earlier , this four is your , the termination reactions .   2.0625281367188193
As I said , that bimolecular termination is not possible , bimolecular termination by the action of two propagating species is not possible and so if you can suppress the other , other reactions , which are chain transfer reaction , if you can suppress those , you can actually keep this chains , this ionic chains as living because you can , because the inherent or intrinsic termination reaction between the propagating species are not there , they are absent .   2.7607623837841277
You will find out in later discussion , that in case of cationic there are other ways , which are likely like chain transfer reactions , but in case of anionic it is comfortably easy to make polymerization , leaving chain polymerization .   2.5800769166810986
Whereas , in case of radical , we know , that this termination can be possible by bimolecular reaction of the two propagating new species .   3.108215384681583
So , let us now talk in detail about the cationic polymerization .   2.135668819490648
So , let us talk about and again , like radical polymerization if any chain polymerization , this cationic chain polymerization we were discussing .   2.938131706052483
Now , HX would be strong enough if these acids should be stronger enough to produce significant concentration of the protonal species , so that it can initiate , react with the monomer .   1.999352433284538
For example , if I consider a case of halogen acids like HX and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond .   2.5533697100709474
So , your reaction stops there .   1.6754690803523709
You cannot have the reaction progressing further .   1.9545940621094107
So , so other protonic acids like H 2 SO 4 or say , HClO 4 or phosphoric acid .   1.544464164021807
So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation .   2.830712752858194
So , most , most popular , most important , this electrophilic reaction is reaction of Lewis acids .   1.570064175770446
So , these are Lewis , Lewis acid can be used for supplying an electrophile for reaction with the monomer , but it is this Lewis acids are seldom used alone .   2.722050520771632
We will just give examples in few minutes .   2.514521192655148
So , if you consider this case the reaction happens like this .   3.0980287450097217
BF 3 plus H 2 O makes a complex or we can use other Lewis acids and we can use this alkyl halides as a cocatalyst and this case , the complex found is like this .   2.717865141439227
So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor .   3.408568519277418
This is coinitiator , coinitiator , BF 3 or AlCl 3 are , sometimes they are called this BF 3 or AlCl 3 , called catalyst and this initiator called cocatalyst .   2.1161193853994886
So , you should be careful about this nomenclature , other you called this as initiator and coinitiator or you called this as catalyst and this is the cocatalyst .   2.522760387936762
Similarly , you can write this similar reaction for this aluminum chloride and alkyl halide reaction .   2.2554779357017556
This alkyl halide could be , say for example , R could be tertiary carbon or could be a triphenyl carbon group .   2.193785567546682
This is I and which then react with a monomer forming the chain initiating spices .   2.780722282760547
Now , we are writing ki for this reaction because it has been found out , that of these two reactions , this is the two reactions , consists of chain reaction , chain initiation reaction .   3.5420034328814434
So , we will consider this reaction while calculating or while determining the , or looking at the kinetics of this chain polymerization .   2.613718987118267
Remember , if you compare with the radical chain polymerization , this was the first reaction compared to the step , the first step , where radical was getting generated from the initiator molecule and we considered that as a rate determining step for radical chain polymerization .   3.0031714344240275
But in this ionic chain polymerization we , this is the faster reaction step where this is the slower and rate determining step .   3.7266717361777513
So , for ionic reaction monomer also participate in the chain initiation reaction where in case of radical monomer was not actually part of the chain initiating expression Now , the reaction rate also depend , depends on this YZ , which is basically a cocatalyst .   3.174493642671842
It will also influence the polymerization rate because the activity of the initiation complex depends how readily it can transfer a proton to the monomer and that in turn depends on the acidity of this cocatalyst .   2.694762904567421
So , basically the type of cocatalyst also influence the polymerization because the acidity of this , this complex , the activity of this complex depends on how readily it can supply this cationic species , where I say proton or in this case it is a proton or a carbocation to the monomer , and for a proton or protogen or a proton supplier , it depends on the acidity of the cocatalyst .   2.6233828949324267
So , it follows this trend and for the carbon cationic generator like RCl , like AlCl 3 plus , this reaction .   1.9743719831068394
Obviously , I , the catalyst or the coinitiator also affects the rate of polymerization .   1.8084961757423939
For a single metal follow this trend of the ligand .   2.1127649570278977
If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come .   2.5908468132286946
Now , there are other initiation reactions , other initiation reactions , for example , halogen , halogen can be reacting with more acidic Lewis acid and gives out cation , halogen cation .   1.8268405631161335
But as I mentioned in earlier , these are the generic examples , which we get in this page .   3.2138530081644565
These are the most common example of or the most important initiation reaction .   3.3238062812445603
So , let us now discuss the propagation step .   2.1688439763364373
So , you have this initiator , coinitiator complex , which starts the chain initiation .   2.546171243867079
I write this in the next page , it can react with the name and start the chain propagation reaction and I can write a generic expression of this in this way plus M kp n plus 1 M plus IZ minus .   3.0085005904369484
I just recall from your earlier decision , I am writing the propagating reactions here .   1.8452251713227776
This , on reacting on with isobutylene , will produce the.. ... So , these are the examples of the propagating steps and sometimes this propagation reaction could be complicated and because of this one two hydride shift , but that is not very common .   2.52303980700255
I will just give you an example when this propagating steps could be little complicated and by hydride shift or shift and that is applicable for say , propene or one alkene , one alkenes , take example .   2.2057203314505203
Now , this can undergo a hydride shift and from this carbo cation .   2.4817959695042293
If this happens , the reactions become very complicated and we call that sometimes isomerization polymerization as well .   2.1517234467602293
The example we gave , most common propagation steps are in this page , what we just discussed now and as you can realize , that the rate of propagation will depend on the solvents .   2.90554959441
So , the rate of polymerization will be higher .   3.5078262714303854
Now , let us have , let us see some data related to convince that understanding .   2.35525554650863
Say , let us take example of styrene , polymerization of styrene by or chloric acid HClO 4 solvent is a mixture of CCl 4 and ethylene dichloride .   1.902945348095889
If you have pure CCl 4 , obviously , this is more non - polar , dielectric constant is 2.3 and the rate is low .   3.0991265854175407
When you increase the polarity by adding ethylene dichloride , dichloethane , EU , say in 40 - 60 mixture , your dielectric constant goes up , your reaction goes up .   1.9406458892115805
For example , one beta proton transfer to either monomer or counter ion or say polymer itself , solvent or some impurities , which is present or a transfer agent , like the case of chain radical polymerization , we talk about the chain transfer is possible .   3.154548926426414
And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , I can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization .   2.984156647592647
So , one , depending on which proton is leaving you can get actually two structures with double bond .   1.9424113057904144
For example , like you have alpha methane styrene in case of , say , example , the monomers like styrene , where you always get only one possible double bond because there is only one possible beta hydrogen to be eliminated .   2.7004331950869767
We have been discussing so far the steady state analysis of mass transfer and biochemical reaction in immobilized enzyme reactors .   2.2696831238723183
JD factor is defined as a lumped parameter which takes into an account the mass transfer coefficient particularly field diffusion coefficient as well as the reactor operational parameters .   2.1717060696666897
The JD factor is JD factor = ( kL ?   1.422051830734854
The first term in the parenthesis represents the mass transfer function ; the other is dimensional number which gives you the operational parameters and here kL is a mass transfer coefficient ; ?   2.6288577665116306
It has been shown at least empirically in a large number of experimental data that JD is equal to JD = C ( Re ) - n A very general relationship for JD factor has been given that it ’ s a function of Renault number to the power minus n and under different conditions of particle shape and the range of Renault number the magnitude of C and n varies and that can be estimated for a particular system .   2.638399142202935
If you look at this one , you will notice that from the estimation of JD factor as a function of C , Renault number to the power minus n one can determine the value of kL .   2.9111819770758993
The magnitude of kL then gives you at steady state , the reaction rate .   2.4084660433036755
That is v ’ = kLam ( Sb - SS ) = rm Under steady state both the biochemical reaction and the mass transfer rate are equal .   2.8407659743398987
JD can be computed from a variety of correlations as I mentioned .   2.116308287093154
This is only one of probably a large number of relationships that are reported in the literature of heterogeneous catalysis in chemical engineering .   2.8252415785256884
For spherical particle JD is equal to JD = 1.625 ( NRe ) - 0.507 This is one of the relationships which have been proposed but a large number of such empirical correlations are known .   2.5288110897116294
For example in the case of CSTR , life is much simpler ; if the fractional conversion desired is very high even at a high initial substrate concentration , the substrate concentration in the reactor will be quite low and that is the substrate concentration which is going in the outlet stream .   3.6276594658904653
Similarly in the case of PFR , because the enzyme loading is very high usually in PFR , a large fraction of the reactor also experiences a low substrate concentration .   3.091833798479029
kf is equal to a pseudo first order rate constant for enzyme catalyzed reaction which is k ’ 2E0 / K ’ m .   2.921717948264927
Therefore rate of mass transfer is rm = kLam. ( Sb - SS ) In the case of a non - porous particle the issue is to develop an expression which gives you the substrate concentration at the surface because the reaction will take place at the surface of substrate concentration .   3.0633156612976684
kf apparent will be kL.kf.am kappf = kf + kL In your reactor design equation you can incorporate , instead of first order rate constant as this one which is based only on biochemical reaction , this rate expression .   1.9475652090304127
kappf can be used to designate the reactor performance of the first order immobilized enzyme reactor with film diffusion limitations or film diffusion control .   2.8200909856529073
Even in chemical engineering that is very conventional thing ; only difference is that those catalysts are very , very stable interms of their thermal , operational as well as storage stability where as immobilized enzymes are not as stable .   2.411876084052118
But all the analysis is identical and Satterfield also provided a single point reactor performance equation based on film diffusion control for heterogeneous catalyst .   1.7816765004580868
If the mass transfer has to be incorporated this much of length of the reactor is required under these operational conditions to have the substrate concentration equivalent to biochemical reaction .   2.9686868682483047
That means to make Sb - Ss equal to zero , without any biochemical reaction this much of height of the reactor is required under these operational conditions .   2.432948833198286
You simply design your reactor on the basis of biochemical reaction and be happy .   1.9831320673216508
On the other hand if this height required is reasonably high then you forget about biochemical reactions and design the reactor based on diffusional requirements based on the mass transfer coefficients .   2.09020820780309
This is basically empirical equation depending upon the reaction operational data the height required for effecting the mass transfer across that film .   2.399676971502261
Yes . Exactly what we are assuming here is that there is no reaction within the pores of the particle .   2.5836090351740904
All the enzymes are present on the surface and in the thin film there is no reaction taking place .   3.79371363311362
You must appreciate the difference between the internal pore diffusion and external film diffusion while in the case of internal pore diffusion during the transport of the substrate in the particle reaction is also taking place whereas here there is no reaction taking place along with the mass transfer ; its only mass transfer .   2.8868646423551674
If suppose there is no reaction taking place then along the length of the reactor at Z the substrate concentration will reach to Sb same as in bulk .   2.7483264414817796
It will take some time whereas if the biochemical reaction is also taking place at the substrate then that length required will be given by Z2 at substrate concentration Ss .   2.767475761436164
In the case of porous matrices a very large quantity of fraction of total enzyme which is immobilized is within the pores of the particle .   2.384537518316495
The quantity of enzyme immobilized on the surface is in fact very , very small compared to total surface area in which the whole enzyme is distributed inside the pores of the reactor .   3.022221806396603
Very broadly the effect of internal pore diffusion in a very simplistic way is described for isothermal reaction incorporated in the pore diffusional effects by k ’ 2E0Ss v ’ = ?   2.3247816081780734
But at the moment we are talking only of biochemical reaction and internal pore diffusion assuming that the transport through a film is fast enough and it does not create any problem .   2.4828840439755946
That means there is no concentration gradient across the film .   3.2480538765986338
In this case this is defined by a factor ?   2.834215334243877
which is called as effectiveness factor .   1.7580163602198806
This effectiveness factor is the ratio of the rate of actual reaction in the matrix divided by the maximum reaction rate obtainable if there was no pore diffusional resistance .   3.407078828958464
That is if for example you take a particle let us say of one millimeter diameter ; determine the reaction rate and then also take a particle let us say of ten microns or twenty microns diameter in which we assume that the pore length is very , very small .   2.69303112964699
Even if the diffusional rate is very slow the substrate can reach to all parts of the enzyme go down to as low as possible and the ratio of the two that means the maximum reaction rate which you can get when you go down in the particle size to that of the reaction rate which is obtained by a particular particle size is defined as the effectiveness factor .   3.8273215702954255
You have Sb here ; you reached Ss ; there is no substrate concentration gradient but then here onwards there is a gradient .   2.5868021784050064
There are two things you must appreciate in contrast to the film diffusional effects .   2.1813799533658575
One is that there is a rate of diffusion ; the substrate will take some time to reach to the different sites of the enzyme present in the pores .   4.178907918890656
Ultimately when you will measure the enzyme activity you will see that the enzyme activity is low because per unit enzyme loading the activity which will be expressed by the immobilized enzyme particle will be lower .   3.1737993113344642
So therefore if particle size is reduced you get an advantage that the fraction of the total particle which is receiving the substrate increases coming to one when the particle size is too small and usually in most cases as per the experimental experiences that a particle size about thirty microns in most cases of the biochemical reactions has been considered to give you an effectiveness factor of one .   2.502389474787817
That is what is the ultimate limit and the internal pore diffusion effects are described by effectiveness factor .   2.658390004262408
The first condition will be the enzyme kinetics where substrate inhibition is very strong .   2.9157419962013034
The enzymes that are very strongly substrate inhibited may show an effectiveness factor greater than one because the reaction rate when the substrate concentration drops becomes higher than at the surface .   2.7352623574622346
If the substrate concentration is high at the surface the reaction rate is low .   4.055924245445294
The other alternative case of the effectiveness factor exceeding unity is that of a case where we experience partitioning effects particularly … .   2.772435613275642
Take a typical example of alcohol dehydrogenase .   1.9540367274107227
The reaction product ends up in hydrogen ions ; there will be a pH change and that pH change enhances the enzyme activity .   2.531786910224638
So there are two extreme cases where effectiveness factor show discrepancy from the theoretical understanding .   1.9982154638126104
In the case of strongly substrate inhibited enzymes , if the concentration of substrate at the surface is high then for substrate inhibited reaction , the reaction rate will be low and because of the pore diffusional parameter the substrate concentration across the pores is reducing .   3.463436527140334
As we saw here the substrate concentration goes down along the pores and substrate concentration going down means the react rate of reaction increases .   2.7229405242527767
No . When there is a partitioning of hydrogen ions and the conditions are such that the rate of reaction as a result of partitioning increases that is the condition .   3.560031235869279
If the partitioning creates unfavorable conditions for the reaction then it will not be more than one .   3.9027802166270864
Only when the hydrogen ions are produced and the micro environment created by the reaction in the form of product .   2.8810385918678483
You must incorporate partitioning effects also in the steady state analysis .   2.394964310055216
Then only you can compare .   1.9822458246114674
This is dx the length of differential element .   2.8504489653934453
R is the radius of the pore .   3.2667330985905885
dS / dx is negative and this is output of the substrate from the pore .   3.112394471670393
The conversion as a result of biochemical reaction is v ’ ( 2pR ) dx .   2.275507795992577
If you rearrange you get ( ds / dx ) out - ( ds / dx ) in 2 - .v ’ = 0 dx RD If you take limit dx tends to zero you can write simply as the second order differential equation d2s / dx2 – 2 / DR .   2.2936502229991187
No . Sorry diffusional coefficient will come here .   1.5338508092958312
It is not going .   3.8424378892603746
We have multiplied here too or v / D either way .   1.8293169809638457
In today ’ s lecture we planned to cover interfacial polymerization , and we also will be talking about different synthesis of different step polymers in very brief briefly .   2.340573001705128
And at the end , I planned to just give a summary of this module on step growth polymerization .   2.377344369486833
We also discussed various way of making branched and cross linked polymers .   1.9494287194395856
And we also studied in that context that in case of branching reaction going on the molecular build up is higher for a given conversion in comparison to a linear polymerization .   3.1368258236779814
I mean by successful , I mean a building of the molecular weight of the polymer , which is targeted and in most cases it is a high molecular weight polymers .   3.149398550740987
Now , suppose you have done everything right , whatever instruction is given to you in the this course or in any text book , you have followed everything right .   1.7373716059279918
You have taken monomers in a ratio very close to r is equal to 1 and you have done the reaction at high temperature for longer time , try to take out the condensate for you know as much as possible .   2.9792023479865057
Now , what does it mean it does not mean it all the instruction given to you are incorrect , you have to deep you know look into deep what might have happened .   2.2109081693574004
And I just I will give you few guide line in the deep something goes wrong in spite of doing your best possible way ; now what are the things to look for and let us look one by one .   2.4821535206746774
So , there is a guide line for trouble shooting , now you must be capturing the condensate in a trap will distilling of the condensate byproduct you must be you know must be collecting that in a trap .   2.248014546265962
Now , you analyze the end of the reaction , you analyze that that material in the trap and see whether you found any monomers in there .   2.466206517646787
But still , because one of the monomers might have volatile in excess than other , which will imbalance your stoichiometric ratio and which will definitely going to decrease your final molecular weight .   2.0917761654644984
You can start slowly , which means that you take a you take the reaction and carry out the reaction for some time at a lower temperature and at atmospheric pressure .   3.4994671212471538
Then their volatility tendency of volatility would come down as their molecule weight increases increased by this time .   1.6724413282270676
So , what you can do in reaction you can do in the steps , you can do the first step in a lower temperature and at higher pressure and then slowly increase the temperature and reduce the pressure .   3.219010712723659
So , that is the one way you can reduce and the volatility of the vocalization of the monomers .   2.6446184092157146
And specially look for the chain stoppers which are mono functional molecules , if you find them which means it is as a result of degradation or a side reaction there would be either imbalance in the stoichiometry .   2.235324650727436
Or there would be generation of this mono functional chain stopper , which will which will stop your polymer chains to progress further .   1.9885913439464136
So , that will again reduce the molecular weight build up .   3.004268530036056
So , you might consider chaining the catalyst or even reducing catalyst amount in the reaction .   2.1740478763989572
For example , if you have say during a polyester formation , if you have something like this , there is one more very common side reaction is happens is by beta elimination reaction .   2.8793377844591075
So , third thing you can do as I was mentioning is that you change the catalyst or sometimes catalyst a I said might accelerate the side reactions as well .   2.353210569224927
And if you are doing in a solution , you are doing this poly step polymerization reaction solution , then you can also try and change the solvent .   3.470839848097022
Now , so these are the things you can try out , if your reaction goes wrong and of course , if this nothing else work with this you might have to consider changing your reaction monomer , you are changing your monomers all together .   2.2884813636049595
For example , if you have diacid chloride , chloride plus diol forming polyester polyester , say diacid chloride plus diamine polyamide .   2.0577115954722482
And this first reaction are you know the has been taken that , this the fastness of these reactions has been taken .   2.668228333263027
And it has been used in making polymers by interfacial polymerization .   2.884860298168844
Interfacial polymerization reactions are happened in the interface between 2 liquid phase , 2 monomers are taken in two different liquid phase and the reaction happen in the interface .   2.385140464997582
Now , this at the interface react with phosgene forming this come out which again with reaction with this phenolate salt will form a dimer in this case and reaction will proceed further in this way .   2.522022764138934
So , this is a very slow reaction , if you do the reaction in this way this will give you a very slow reaction .   4.200307058691816
So , what is done to tackle this problem a tri a amine is added in the organic medium , say triethylamine or trimethylamine and when this reacts with this species it is form a salt now this is water soluble .   2.24992519063909
So , then the reaction of this two reacting species will be happening in the organic side of the interface .   3.067853819598735
Bisphenol a poly carbonate is having this commercial trade names , I will be giving all this you know some of the trade names of this polymers in the next few slides as well .   2.304914921848262
So , what are the characterize , for the characteristic for the interfacial polymerization we just discussed one that polymerization occurs the interfacial of two liquids and each of the liquid phase contains one reactant .   2.1342743322801097
So , you do not need not to maintain a stoichiometry of say very close to one is to one like the other linear poly condensation reaction here .   2.463505034399907
Because , the stoichiometry are the interface is always maintained at one is to one , because reaction is not happening in the valve phase of the two monomers it is happening only at the interface and because reaction happening one is to one .   2.424074074096056
Now , the reaction is fast , so the when the monomer defuse to the interface immediately it find a chain end reactive chain end and in reacts before even can approach to the other monomer , which means that this unlike this linear poly condensation reaction , which talked about it happens in a kinetic control way and it is very fast .   2.563179559821268
So , what is the outcome that molecular build up is much easier , because the as soon as the monomers defuse from the bulk to interface it reacts with the chain end and the chain grows one after one .   2.862432185486866
So , the chain grows in size , so it is very you know it is comparatively much easier to build molecular weight .   3.119608813059066
And as the reactions are happening or the monomers is getting added at the end of the chain , high molecular weight even possible at low conversion .   3.1818621943152974
And because the diffusion is slower compared to the actual reaction , polymerization reaction this reaction this polymerization reaction are often diffusion controlled .   2.8380040026265037
So , what are the requirements for a successful inter polymerization interfacial polymerization you need to have a inorganic base , which you require to neutralize the produce HCl otherwise HCl with go back and hydrolyze the salt .   2.271507566425156
And the other way also you should restrict or minimize the acid chloride hydrolysis , because if it hydrolyze and form a plane alcohol , then it will just acid chloride if it hydrolyze to form simple acid carboxylic acid .   2.2803311764799874
Proper choice of solvent , you must be taken and you need , because this reaction is happening interface .   2.6666513493045727
So , product might will form much faster rate , if you are not starting the reaction .   2.3582083499210325
So , what are the disadvantage in spite of all this advantages , this is not this interfacial polymerization are not practiced very frequently commercially , so there must be some disadvantages .   2.5870428054425934
So , it is is not very economic in true sense and as you as you saw that we have to use wider lot of organic solvent and handling that large amount of organic solvent recycling them , and storing them and is a environmental hazard as well storing and handling them this organic solvent .   2.241648966599116
Now , also polymers if you with it is presented in a solution most and most commonly in the organic solvent .   1.9104373607041294
So , you have to at the end of the polymerization you have to take out the poly carbonate by steam precipitation if you steam precipitation .   2.9064436897742323
So , there are always chances of having more impurities , compared to if you are doing in a bulk condition or a in a solution pure solution and also it is a batch process it is very difficult to do it continuously and as this reaction is kinetically controlled .   3.0975836558728975
The chances of forming cyclics are much more , because cyclics are not reacting with the byproduct and forming the linear product once again , which means once cyclics forms it will remain in the final product .   2.076805526904393
So , now we move to the different polymers , in coming few slides I just wanted to give you the standard synthetic process of the common commercial step polymers .   2.4181880332845056
I just wanted to give you a brief idea of different types of step polymers and how they are synthesized commercially , just in a very brief .   3.1644556717337378
We will start with polyester and just example we will take is the most important and most used polyester poly ethylene terephthalate .   2.5659927352618945
This is the structure we have been showing you many times , these are several ways you can see synthesis PET Poly Esters Terephthalate , you can do take a ethylene ethylene glycol and diacid terephthalate acid .   2.5795491640770645
And direct reaction you can take instead of terephthalate acid you can take dimethyl ester of terephthalate acid you can take acid chloride and acid an hydride and so on an hydride and so on .   2.229460486752084
What did the commercial way of synthesis or the most practiced the synthetic process of making polyester or poly ethylene terephthalicin .   1.6064201301521819
This case is by ester exchange it can be done either starting from dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid or from terephthalic acid itself .   2.1895620992178966
And then these are now heated to a much higher temperature and the ethylene glycol is distilled out from the reaction .   2.9405701960070814
So , between two of this molecules exchange ester exchange happen and as you take out this ethylene glycol from the system polymerization medium the polymer start growing slowly this is the .   2.7273950984421793
And another way of making the PET is instead of taking dimethyl terephthalate , you can start with terephthalicacid and make first this an then follow the same process .   2.1331646617846425
We will move to the next class of polymers step polymers polyamides and we have this is linear poly polymerization reactions this is aliphatic diamine with aliphatic diacid you can directly under go reaction to form linear polyamide .   2.3255977468936697
Now , in last slide we saw aliphatic diamine and aliphatic diacids , now we want to move to the aliphatic diamines and aliphatic diester or diacid chloride in this case .   2.2582470192041995
And these this polyamides are completely formed from aromatic groups containing aromatic groups .   1.7141094407070585
So , these are aromatic polyamides and commonly known as aramid polymers and because the reactivity of this nitrogen attach to the aromatic ring is much less compared to if it as a simple aliphatic aliphatic aliphatic group .   2.3094035333187724
So , typically in case of aromatic polyamide synthesis , aromatic diamines are reacted with aromatic diacid chloride and you get this completely aromatic polyamides .   2.324150010291114
Instead of you can use the para substituted diamine with para substitute diacids to form this linear polyamides aromatic polyamides .   1.8637311652295907
So , these are very high polymers which are high very high performance polymers we move to next say we have just given generic example of branching and cross linking in last lecture .   2.70357160211944
Here , we I show you a definite examples you have ethyl an hydride here and we have a glycerol , when it reacts in this to reacts it form a linear chain along with a branch coming from this hydroxyl group .   2.256520366582277
So , this is how you can carry out a there is a one example of forming bunch you know synthesis bunch polyester .   2.7970054990840545
So , you have synthesized in this way a unsaturated polyester .   2.9883880398316878
So , here you first make a step polymers , by step polymerization mechanism you make a unsaturated polyester , and then by doing a chain reaction you can do a cross linking reaction to form a cross linking reaction .   2.9291520597929437
If this instauration is at the end of the polyester , which you formed then these are known as alkyd polyesters , how do you do that , the same reaction like in this case phthalic an hydride glycerol there you are hiding one mono functional acids , which has a alkene group a double bond at the other end .   2.405110696121347
These are typically you know , these are available in the fatty acid there are lots of fatty acid which are which can be unsaturated available where you have a unsaturation or double bond in a other side not necessary end , but other side .   2.641194258410617
Now , this double bond is free to undergo chain polymerization .   2.8463710942365648
So , you can first stage you do a step polymerize to syntheses this and then you can take this and do a second step of chain polymerization either by oxidizing this or no using the other methods .   2.7944727316057123
So , you can carry out the reaction with this the salt of phenolate phenolate ion and you can make a polymers like linked this .   2.977372692125268
They are partially crystalline this PEEK and PEK poly ether ether ketone and polyether ketone they are partially crystalline polymers they have a T g around this range and they have a very high melting point .   2.484457657593233
So , they also used in applications where string and link requirement for high temperature .   2.2233755762045204
There are also amorphous T g is very high and their continuous use temperature is 300 to 350 degree centigrade temperature .   2.894865889688166
I am just moving it fast , because this just information I my aim is to just give you the generic synthetic procedure for this class of step polymers .   2.1584947585779863
But just for this course I am just giving you a over view of this different step polymer and just generic method of synthesizing this .   1.984410494361954
So , we move to polyether imides again this is the process of making polyether imides and these are again very high heat polymers ; that means , this having very capability of you know they can be used in very high temperature .   3.1623893064800934
So , in the if the application required that you the polymer will should be present at this high temperature .   2.6204079557516433
So , you can use ultem as your material ; obviously , these polymers are costly , because they have , so high performance and they are also difficult to synthesize there are the same time much costlier then the common polymers .   2.5936566746626726
And this is sold as a trade name as turlon , this is also very high heat polymer , this is also amorphous T g having 270 to 285 and the constant use temperature is 220 to 235 .   2.379788099682515
Now , there are other step there are several other step polymers , which you know because of time or this course of this polymers is not to go through the detailed synthesis procedure of this polymers .   2.6674622839255986
So , there are this is just a to mention that there are other step polymers as well listed in this slide .   2.851194995250725
And which you can go through any text book or any standard publications to find out , if you are interested how they are synthesized and what are their property you know basic property .   2.669523675289635
So , what I wanted to do next to just give you idea about step copolymers , now if you have say a amino acid R COH and NS 2 R double dash COH .   2.209855311416615
Now , obliviously it will form , now why do we put the bracket will be always next to each other should I put the bracket here and put N like this , it may not be it could be somewhere here and there could be another bracket here .   2.6268027543207326
And if you have two different group in side then you can make a copolymer , but this has not very regularly used method from making copolymer , if you the practiced methods are normally if you say , if you are making a polyester , if you have say CH 2 CH 2 OH ethylene glycol .   2.7624864277931036
Now , you have to make the total of these total of this diol with the ratio of this thing is close to one is to one .   2.9419675889681294
So , total number of functional group of OH group is almost close to the number of groups of COH group , so that the polymers take place .   3.1320445576925215
So , this a example of copolymers of PET and PBT polyethylene terephthalate copolybutylene terephthalate depending upon the ratio of these two you know which in which one will be higher or not .   2.938242169518539
Now , what do you except when you make this copolymer will there be alternative copolymer , that mean will you have this ethylene glycol group .   2.372085346972924
Average perplexity: 2.615631941089133
